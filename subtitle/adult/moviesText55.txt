Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello! I came specially to meet you,
I love your playing.
Who are you? My name's Dorota,
I'm Jurek's sister.
- You're bleeding!
- No, it's nothing.
Dorota, write him a fan letter later,
this isn't the best time, c'mon.
Jurek, why have you been hiding her?
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take to much!
- How many suitcases are you taking?
- And what... what you think,
should I take Uncle Szymon's portrait?
- Take it, don't take it, what you like.
- Can't you see I'm worried sick?
- Oh! He'll come home, he'll be all right.
Wiladek, oh! Mama, Wladek's home.
- Thank God Wladek! You're wounded!
- No, it's a little cut, it's nothing.
- I've been worried sick.
- You had your papers on you.
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd have known where to take you.
- Henryk, don't say things like that.
- What did I tell you?
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like we're doing?
- They bombed us, we're off the air.
- Warsaw's not the only radio station.
- Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw. - Where?
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?
- Oh. Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.
- The government's moved to Lublin.
All able bodied men must go across the
river and set up a new line of defense.
There's hardly anybody left in this
building, only women, the men have gone.
Do you set up a new line of defense
with your luggage?
- Wiladek, there's no time for this.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good! I'm not going anywhere either!
- We've got to keep together.
No. If I'm going to die, I prefer
to die in my own home. I'm thankful.
- God forbid.
- You shut up! I've got something. Listen.
News has just been received from the
BBC in London. The British Government,
having received no reply to the ultimatum
presented to the German government,
has declared war on Nazi Germany
- Oh, it's wonderful, wonderful.
- It is expected that...
Don't, don't.
Within the next few hours,
France will make a similar declaration.
- My God!
- Poland is no longer alone.
Oh! It's great.
Wonderful!
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- Yes, it certainly was.
- For this celebration I made an effort.
- Here's to Great Britain and France.
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
All will be well. Oh!
Five thousand and three.
- Is that all?
- Yes, 5'003 zlotys. That's all we have.
It's 3'003 zlotys too much.
Look: Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets:
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum
of 2'000 in their homes.
- What shall we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.
Banks? Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?
We could hide the money. Here, we could
hide the money under the flower pot.
No. We'll use tried and tested methods.
You know what we did in the last war?
We made a hole in the table leg
and we hid the money in there.
- And suppose they take the table away?
- What?
The Germans, they take what they want,
furniture, valuables, anything.
Idiot! What would they want
with a table? A table like this?
- What on earth are you doing?
- No, this is the best place for it,
- no one would looking under the flower pot.
- No, no. Listen, I've been thinking.
- Oh! Really that's a change.
- We use psychology.
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, and we cover it like this.
- In full view.
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.
- The stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Of course they'll notice it.
Look, look here! Idiot.
Oh! Oh! And you call me stupid.
No, that is very good.
- This will take hours.
- Oh!
- How would you get them out?
- I don't know, you use tweezers.
- Why do you resist everything?
- Quiet!
- Quiet please! Quiet! Order, please!
- She's a lawyer. She likes order.
Listen. Just listen. Look,
the watch we'll put under the flowerpot
and the money we'll stuff in the violin.
- Will I still be able to play?
- You'll find out.
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek? How are you?
- Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
- Fine. We're fine in the circumstances.
But I can guess what you've called about.
There's nothing we can do.
- They won't re-open the station.
- Yes, I know, but Jurek...
Not even music. No radios for the Poles.
But I'm sure you'll find work,
a pianist like you Wladek!
- Well. Maybe, maybe not.
Listen, don't be offended, but I didn't
call to discuss my future career.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.
Then he said: "All right, come with me."
And so I came
and they bombed the station.
I tell you meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
- Really?
- Yes! It was unforgettable.
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.
- No one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope that's a compliment.
- Of course! I mean it!
Who knows! I tried to be funny. Shall we
go to the Paradiso, have a coffee?
I'd like that.
- And you. What do you do?
- Oh, I finished at the conservatoire.
- You're a musician?
- Yes, but only just...
- I'm sorry, what instrument?
- The cello.
I love to see a woman playing the cello.
Here we are.
- This is disgraceful! How dare they!
- You know people are like.
- They want to be better Nazis then Hitler.
- I'm going in there to complain.
- Don't. It's better not. Believe me.
- It's so humiliating. Someone like you.
Good-bye!
- We'll find somewhere else.
- We could walk in the park.
No. We can't. It's an official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.
- Are you joking?
- It's true.
That's another official decree,
no Jews allowed on public benches.
- This is absurd!
- I tell you what we can do.
We can just stand here and talk.
So, you play the cello, Dorota,
that's nice.
Who's your favorite composer? Chopin?
You'll have to learn his cello sonata,
won't you? "And what about you, Wladek?"
Perhaps, I could accompany you,
me on the piano, you on the cello.
Oh, Mr. Szpilman,
you're quite wonderful.
Call me Wladek, please.
"Re: emblems for Jews in the
Warsaw District. I hereby order
that all Jews in the Warsaw District
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors. This decree will come
into force on the 1st of December 1939
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.
The emblem will be worn on the right
sleeve and will represent a blue Star
of David on a white background.
The background must be sufficiently
large for the Star to measure
8 centimeters from point to point.
The width of the arms of the Star
must be one centimeter.
Jews who do not respect this decree
will be severely punished.
Governor of Warsaw District,
Dr Fischer."
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.
Let me see this.
Doesn't it say we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them!
You!
Come here!
Why didn't you bow?
I'm sorry.
You are forbidden
to walk on the pavement.
Walk in the gutter!
- Have you seen this?
- What, what? I'm working!
What is it?
- That's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean, put us?
"By order of the Governor of the
Warsaw District, Dr Fischer,
concerning the Establishment
of the Jewish District in Warsaw.
There will be created a Jewish District
in which all Jews living in or moving
to Warsaw will have to reside."
Look here:
"Jews living outside of the prescribed
area will have to move to the
Jewish district by 31st of October, 1940."
They won't get all of us... it's too
small. There's 400'000 of us in Warsaw!
- No. 360'000, so it'll be easy.
- So what am I supposed to do?
You're a clever man
you'll tell me what I will buy.
- I do my best.
- Mama!
Mama, what is it?
Twenty zlotys.
That's all we have left. Twenty zlotys.
What can I buy with twenty zlotys?
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.
That's the price. That's I'm offering.
And my advice is to accept.
- You won't get more from anyone else.
- But, but it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa.
My advice is to take it. What you going
to do when you're hungry? Eat the piano?
- Get out! You're a thieving bastard!
- Hey! What's the matter with you?
- Get out!
- What you suffering from?
Hey! You people are crazy!
I'm doing you a favor,
two thousand,
and I'm paying for the removal,
I'm not even charging for the removal.
You haven't eaten today, you're crazy
Take it.
Dorota!
Hi! Hello.
I didn't want to come,
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
No, not really, they arrested my cousin.
Jurek says they'll let him out.
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.
That's what I said, it's so...
it's too absurd!
Hey, I... I should...
Well I... I'll see you soon.
Ok.
Goodbye!
Well, to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.
- How will we sleep?
- The girls and I sleep in the kitchen.
You, Henryk and Papa in here!
Look!
Come and look.
Go away, go away, go away.
Papa! Papa!
Papal!
- You sell anything?
- Only Dostoievsky, "The Idiot". 3 zlotys.
- That's better than yesterday.
- 3 lousy Zlotys.
Others are making millions.
-I know. You don't know, believe me.
They bribe the guards.
The guards turn a blind eye.
They're bringing in carloads, food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics,
- the poor are dying, they don't carry.
- Excuse me,
have you seen my husband Izaak Szerman?
A tall handsome man.
- With a little gray beard? No?
- I'm afraid not.
No? Oh, excuse me
Ok, Goodbye, sleep well, but...
but if you see him, write to me,
yes, Izaak Szerman!
Why does a gentile street
has to cross our area?
Don't worry about it, they're about
to build a bridge, haven't you heard?
A bridge, a smedge.
And the Germans claim to be intelligent.
You know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.
I've a family to feed.
I spend half my time here waiting
for them to let us through.
- I didn't come here to listen to the music.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Are you bored?
- You're cold? Come on, move!
- Move on!
- Yeah! That's it! Dance!
- Dance!
- Come on, dance! Go on!
Yeah, that's nice. And you?
Don't you wanna dance, too?
Now we clear the street for
a jewish dancefloor.
And... you...
Yes, you both!
Faster!
That's nice.
And faster! Yeah...
- Go!
- And faster!
I said, faster!
Move on! Move! Faster!
I said, dance!
Good, they're here,
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.
- So what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes, his...
His father's back in the jewelry.
Businesses and doing well, Yitzchak?
- Amazing. Jewelry.
- We're recruiting.
- Who's recruiting?
- I've come here as a friend.
Almost half a million Jews from
the entire country are in the Ghetto.
- We need more Jewish police.
- Oh? More Jewish police?
You want me to beat up Jews with my
truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit?
- Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
- I thought all you only recruited boys
with rich fathers. Look at us...
- I'm looking at you, that's why I'm here.
Your whole family can have a better life.
You want to go on selling books?
- Yes, please.
- I'm doing you people a favor.
Wiladek, you're a great pianist. And we've
got an excellent police Jazz band.
- They'd welcome you with open arms.
- Thank you. But I've got work.
- I can't hear anything. It's too loud.
- Yes of course!
I'm sorry, Wladek,
he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
I always say look on the bright side.
You're in the small ghetto, intellectuals,
professional people. Here, in the
large ghetto, it's a cesspool.
- Jehuda, give me something to do.
- You're an artist, you keep...
people's spirits up. You do enough.
- But I want to help, I...
You're too well known. And you know what?
You musicians don't make good
conspirators. You're too... too...
musical!
Who is there?
- Symche!
- Majorek.
There are notices going up.
The city's to be cleaned of undesirables.
- No notices going up...
- Hello, Symche, Dolek,
Mrs. Zyskind,
- Jehuda. Working hard?
- Majorek...
This is the greatest pianist in Poland,
maybe in the whole world.
Wiladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.
- How do you do?
- I know your name.
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the army.
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.
You'd better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.
You know how many copies we print
of our newspaper? Five hundred.
You know how many people on average
read on copy? Twenty.
That makes ten thousand readers.
These will start the uprising.
Majorek hides them in his underpants.
And leaves them in toilets.
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.
Germans never use Jewish toilets.
They're too clean for them.
Please, a piece of bread,
please, please Mister,
please one zloty.
You little bastard!
Stop it, stop it!
Stop it! Stop!
Come on, come on! Come on boy.
Come on.
Stand up, stand up!
Stand up, stand up!
And please, tonight, for once,
I don't want anything bad talked about.
- Enjoy our meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.
- You know Dr. Raszeja.
- The surgeon.
The surgeon. Well, for some reason,
don't ask me why, the Germans allowed him
into the Ghetto to perform an operation.
- They allowed a Pole to operate a Jew?
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation. He'd just made
the first incision when the SS burst in,
shoot the patient lying on the table,
then Dr Raszeja and everybody else there.
Isn't that a laugh?
The patient didn't feel a thing.
He was anaesthetized.
- I said nothing bad, Henryk.
- What's the matter with you all?
- You lost your sense of humor?
- It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny?
You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What's my tie got to do with anything?
I need the tie for my work.
- Your work?
- Yes. I tried. I work.
- Playing the piano for all this parasites.
- Boys...
- They don't care about people's sufferings.
- You blame me for their apathy.
- They don't notice what's going on around.
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?
- American Jews, there are a lots of them.
What have they done for us?
People are dying, nothing to eat.
The Jewish bankers should be persuading
America to declare war on Germany.
Lights! Lights!
Open up! Light on!
Quick! Come here!
Stay!
Open up! Come on! No luggage!
- Open up!
- No, please, no!
We didn't do anything, please, no!
Stand up!
You, stand up! Get up!
Throw him out!
- Ah!
- Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake!
My God!
- Come on! Run! Run!
- Run!
Matches! Matches!
Excuse me! I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
Yes. Come in! Not you!
- What's happened?
- It's terrible!
They're hunting people on the streets.
They've taken Henryk.
All right, go home, all right, go home.
I'll take care of it.
You children,
can't you find somewhere else to beg!
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband Izaak Szerman?
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, a little grey beard.
If you see him, write to me,
don't forget, Izaak Szerman!
Faster, keep moving! Run!
- What's happened here?
- They've got my grandson in there.
They pick'em up. They take'em away.
What do they do to them?
I've stopped believing in God.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yitzchak?
Yitzchak? Yitzchak, here!
It's Wladek Szpilman!
- Henryk's in there.
- I haven't seen him.
- Believe me, they've picked him up.
- Tough luck!
- Can you help?
- Oh, now you need me, yes, yes...
- Can you help us?
- It costs.
- I've no money.
- Well, sorry.
- You should have joined us earlier.
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?
- People... people I know.
They said you're an important man.
Yitzchak!
Urem rach, ale glach!
Ingl haltoch! Ale glach!
- Hey, Mr Rubinstein.
- You... bandit!
- Boom, boom. Dead!
- I am really scared.
For this joke Mr Rubinstein
gets a cigarette, hm?
Ingl haltoch! Cigarettes, thank you.
- Ale glach...
- Right. All men are created equal.
Only the Germans are created
a little more equal.
- Ale glach, ale glach, ale glach...
- Good bye.
Ale glach, ale glach. Ingl haltoch!
Ingl haltoch! Ale glach.
Help! Help! Help! Help!
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Yitzchak Heller,
did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?
- Did you grovel to that piece of shit?
- I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?
With what... With what can I pay him?
Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you. Why do...
you interfere into other's business?
- You're mad, that's your trouble.
That's also my business.
Hey, hey! What's the matter?
- What's the matter? You're sick?
- Hungry.
Mr. Szpilman!
Employment certificate? What's that mean,
no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate
to work for one of the German firms
in the ghetto, otherwise...
- You'll be deported.
- So the rumors were true.
They're going to resettle us.
Send us to labor camps. In the East.
- And they're closing the small ghetto.
- My God.
Wiladek! Wladek!
I thought you'd be off on tour,
playing London, Paris, New York, Chicago.
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.
Have you heard the rumors?
They're going to resettle us in the East.
Rumors, you take it all too much
to heart, Wladek. What's the trouble?
I've been trying to get a certificate
of employment for my father.
I've been trying all the firms and...
- Why didn't you come to me?
- I didn't know you're in this business.
I'm not but Majorek is.
- Can you help? I've no money.
- Please, don't insult us!
- Can you do something for him?
- Schultz Workshop tomorrow, 4 o'clock.
You see? That's the historical
imperative in action.
- That's why I always say, look...
- The bright side, yes I know.
- How is your back?
- Better.
Better?
Better no ask!
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
It won't help you anyway!
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.
Tempo, Tempo.
Go, hopp, hopp, hopp! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Come on, go!
Tempo!
At least we've got work in the ghetto?
At least we're still together.
Out! Assemble in the yard!
Out! Assemble in the yard!
Go, go, go, go!
We're employed here.
We've got certificates.
Wiladek!
Here.
You, to the left!
You!
You! You!
You!
You!
You!
The rest of you get dressed and then
report back here. Bring your belongings.
- Fifteen kilos only.
- Where are you taking us?
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought...
the certificates would save us.
- Stop it, Wladek. Let's hope,
Henryk and Halina will be better off.
Go, go, go!
Move on!
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.
You'll be much better off
than in this stinking ghetto.
Move! Move!
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Why?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
I beg you, don't you have
a drop of water? I beg you, I beg you.
Don't you have a drop of water?
He's dying, my child is dying of thirst!
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you have a drop of water?
Did you hear what I'm saying?
I'm telling you it's a disgrace.
- We're letting them take us to our death.
- Dr Ehrlich, not so loud.
There's half a million of us here,
we could break out of the ghetto.
At least we could die honorably
not as a stain on the face of history.
- Why you so sure that we're dying?
- I'm not sure.
- They plan to wipe us all out!
- Do you want me to fight?
- You need organization, plans, guns.
- Right. Fight them with my violin bow?
The Germans would never squander
a huge lab our force like this.
- They're sending us to a labor camp.
- Look at that cripple, there,
look at the old people, the children,
they're gonna work?
Look at you! Well, you're going
to carry iron girders on your back?
Henryk! Halina! Henryk!
Halina! Henryk!
We heard you were here,
we wanted to be with you.
- We wanted to be with you.
- Stupid, stupid!
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
She's getting on my nerves.
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.
They'd prepared a hiding place and so,
of course, they went there.
But the baby cried as the police came.
She smothered the cries with her hands.
The baby died.
A policeman heard the death rattle.
He found where they were hiding.
What are you reading?
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"
- Very appropriate.
- Yes, that's why I brought it.
Idiot. What's he think
he's going to do with the money?
Hey, boy, come here.
Come here!
- How much for a caramel?
- Twenty zlotys.
- What you're going to do with the money?
- Twenty zlotys.
Have we got twenty between us?
I've got ten, I think.
Five. Ten. Twenty.
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Come on, come on,
keep on!
- Keep moving!
- Go! Move on
- Halina?
- What?
- It's a funny time to say this but...
- What?
I wish, I knew you better.
Thank you.
- Go on! Move on!
- Go till the end of the train!
Move on, go, go!
Szpilman! Szpilman!
Fuck off! Stupid! Go!
Papa! Papa!
Papal!
- Halina! Mama!
- What do you do, Szpilman?
I've saved your life!
Get out, just go! Go!
Don't run!
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
Move on, go!
Move!
- Well, off they go to the melting pot.
- Yes!
Give it to me, you don't need it anymore.
Gimme that!
Papal!
What are you doing? She's pregnant!
Wiladek.
- Why are you here, Wladek?
- It's like this...
I... We...
We... all of them... all of them...
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker the better.
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here
for two days until things die down.
I've bribed a policeman.
He'll come when it's over.
Left about turn!
Forward, march!
- I haven't been outside for two years.
- Don't get over excited.
- Someone you know?
- Yes.
- A beauty. Who is she?
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband's an actor.
- Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
- They hang them for helping Jews.
Left about turn!
Forward, march!
- Stop! Come here!
- Stop!
- What's that?
- A working column.
Right turn!
You, come here!
You!
You! You!
You!
Down!
Down!
Left about turn!
Forward, march!
Did you fix the car?
You know, it'll break!
- How long have you been here?
- Since last night.
I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.
We know what it means.
We sent someone out.
Zygmunt. A good man.
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.
He got to Sokolow. A local railway man
told him the tracks're divided,
one branch leading to Treblinka.
He said every day freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw
branched off to Treblinka
and returned empty.
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.
And civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.
They're exterminating us.
Won't take them long.
We're sixty thousand left.
Out of half a million.
Mostly young people.
And this time we're gonna to fight.
We're in good shape,
organized. We're prepared.
If you need help. I...
Go, go! Faster!
You! Come here!
Shit!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm thinking.
Please no! Please no!
Please no.
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!
And-zick! And-zack!
Get him away from here.
Hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.
Won't last long if he goes on like this.
I'll see
if I can get him something better.
- Trouble!
- Assemble! Fall in!
- Only the Jews!
- Only the Jews!
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!
I have good news for you.
There are rumors go around that we'll...
like to "umsiedeln"... Resettle you...
I promise you that now
and in the future
nothing else is planned.
Ja? For these reasons, we put
information posters on the wall.
To show you our good will.
You should vote one of you
who be allowed to go in town daily
and bring three kilos Kartoffeln,
potatoes,
ja, and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.
So why should we do something else
like this if we would resettle you?
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.
Isn't that something where you,
Jews, are good in, make money.
Carry on.
That one with the string.
The others tied by wire.
What are you doing? Go on working!
Hurry up! It's fucking cold.
- It's so cold.
- Potatoes. Once again potatoes.
Now!
Majorek.
I have a favor to ask.
I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out, it's how you
survive on the other side that's hard.
I know. But...
Last summer, I worked for a day
in Zelazna Brama Square.
I saw someone I knew.
She's an old friend a singer.
Her husband's an actor.
I filled their names and their
address down. If they're still there.
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.
They're good people.
Would you try and make contact?
I mean, you go into the town every day.
Would you just ask them
if they'd help me get out of here?
Any fucking plaster?
Yes.
What were you up to?
Nothing. What the fuck are those?
We're allowed
to take food into the ghetto.
Three kilos of potatoes and a...
Open it.
Yes.
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying, I can smell it.
- Open it.
- Yes, yes.
- I... I...
- Potatoes.
You're all the same.
Give a Jew a little finger...
he takes the whole hand.
You lie to me again
and I'll shoot you personally.
I tried your friends.
They don't live there anymore. But...
- You made contact?
- Be ready to leave.
- When?
- Soon.
Stop!
- Oh, shit.
- Just wait!
- What's going in here?
- And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!
I'll soon teach you discipline!
Jew pigs!
- Know why we beat you?
- No.
- Know why we beat you?
- Why?
To celebrate New Year's eve!
- Now, march! Go on, march!
- Beware, go on! And sing!
Sing something cheerful!
And sing it now and loud!
Do you have a cigarette?
Do you have a match?
I'm sorry. I'm dirty. I'm so filthy...
Andrzej...
We haven't much time. Come on.
You must hurry. Here. See if these fit.
We're going to have to keep moving you.
The Germans are hunting down
indiscriminately now. Jews, non-Jews,
anybody, everybody. And Wladek,
you'd better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.
Marek Gebczynski will look after you.
He's on the other side of town.
You'll stay there tonight.
Then we'll find you somewhere else
- I'll bring you food.
- All right. Let's go.
I'll show you
where you're going to sleep.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow
afternoon. We have a flat for you.
Near the Ghetto wall. But it's safe.
- It's not going to be very comfortable.
- I'll be fine.
Thank you!
I'll take it. Give it to me.
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.
May I ?
I'm going to draw the curtains now.
But you leave them open during
the daytime. Don't forget.
Must feel better
on this side of the wall. Hm?
Yes.
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.
Some bread, potatoes, onions.
I'll come again.
And Janina Bogucki will visit
twice a week. Bring more food.
- See how you are.
- Thank you.
Oh, this is very important,
in case of emergency,
I mean, emergency, go to this address.
- What do you mean you forgot?
- What? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
- Because you are dirt.
- Pig!
- Cow!
- Dirty pig!
- You're a dirty pig!
- Takes one to know one! Pig!
- Hm. You play like an angel, Kitten.
- Why don't you listen?
- I was listening, Kitten.
- Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Fire!
Unit, move!
Thank you.
- I wanted to come earlier but...
- No, no, no. Thank you.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
- I should've fought with them.
- Wladek, stop that.
It's over now. Just be proud it happened.
- My God, did they put a fight.
- Yes.
- So did the Germans.
- They're in shock.
They didn't expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back?
- Who'd have thought?
- Yes, but what good did it do?
What good?
Wiladek, I'm surprised at you.
They died with dignity, that's what
good it did. And you know something else?
Now the Poles will rise. We're ready.
We'll fight too. You'll see.
Get your things together,
you have to leave.
- What? What's happened?
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?
- The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrze.
They're find out about this place, too.
- You must get away at once.
- Where do you want me to go?
Look at me. I'm not leaving.
- Can't I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.
But when they storm into the flat,
throw yourself out of the window.
I have poison on me,
they won't get me alive either.
Open up.
Open this door at once,
or we'll call the police!
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.
It belongs a friend of mine. I just came
to visit but I must have just missed him.
- Have you got your identity card?
- Yes.
- Let me see your identity card!
- Yes, of course...
- identity card!
- What's happening?
He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the Jew!
Don't let him out! Stop him!
- Yes?
- Mr Gebczynski sent me.
- Wiladyslaw Szpilman!
- Dorota!
Come In.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I was given this address.
- I'm looking for a Mr Dzikiewicz.
- Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Come In.
Sit.
I need help.
- He'll be back before curfew.
- I've... I've been in hiding.
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.
- And how's Jurek?
- Dead.
Oh.
- And when's your baby due?
- Christmas.
This is not a good time
to have children. But then...
This is my husband.
Wiladyslaw Szpilman.
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Oh, yes. I remember.
Mr Gebczynski said to contact you
only in case of emergency but...
Don't worry now.
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.
Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry, could...
Could I have a piece of bread?
Yes, of course, we'll eat.
Sit, please, sit.
Thank you.
You're in a very German area.
The building opposite is a hospital
taking in wounded from the Russian front.
The next door is the Schutzpolizei.
Safest place to be.
Right in the heart of the lion's den.
I'll be locking you in.
No one knows you are here.
So keep as quiet as possible.
- All well?
- Thank you.
This is Antek Szalas.
He will be looking after you.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Thank you.
I've given him a second key.
He'll bring you food.
See that you're all right. He's with
the underground. He's a good man.
- You don't remember me, Mr Szpilman?
- I don't think so.
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.
I saw you almost every day.
- Sorry, I don't remember, I...
- Doesn't matter.
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.
And you'll be pleased to hear the Allies
are bombing Germany night after night.
- Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.
- And the Russians giving them hell.
- It's the beginning of the end.
- Oh, let's hope so.
Still alive then?
Here. Sausage. Bread.
You still got that vodka?
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long, now.
- I think, I've got jaundice.
- You don't want to worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.
My grandfather was jilted by his
girl friend when he got jaundice.
- Drink up.
- Why didn't you come sooner?
- It's been over two weeks. I got...
- Problems. Money.
I've got to raise money to buy the food.
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.
Yeah, sell this.
Food's more important than time.
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you.
The Allies have landed in France.
The Russians'll be here soon.
They'll beat the shit out of the Germans.
Any day now.
Wiladek?
Wiladek?
I knew it, I knew this would happen.
- I'm going to get a doctor.
- You can't, it's too dangerous.
- I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
- Don't be ridiculous, he's pediatrician.
- He's still a Doctor.
- No, you stay, I'll go.
We came to say goodbye.
We're going to stay with my mother
in Otwocks. The baby's already there.
It's safer. There's talk that
the uprising will begin any day now.
That man Szalas should be shot.
He's been collecting money on
your behalf all over Warsaw.
Apparently, people gave generously.
So he collected a tidy sum.
My God.
Liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder.
But he'll live.
I'll try to get him some levulose,
but it's not easy.
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows?
- Doctor. Thank you.
- Don't speak. Rest.
Thank you very much for coming
I've brought you some food.
I'll prepare something now for you,
then we must go.
Away from the window!
Watch out, away from the door!
Get your ass down!
To the pharmacy! Go on!
Just get out! Everywhere!
The Germans have surrounded the building!
Get out into the street!
Help, Help me. Someone, somebody,
somebody, help me!
Fischke, go to the 4th floor!
I'm there. There's no one.
Go on. Check the attic.
I'm checking the attic.
No one to see over here.
- Then come down!
- Yeah, come down!
- Any news from your mother?
- Nothing since three weeks.
If she were in trouble,
you would know it.
But how? I'm in worrying about her.
Don't worry.
As I said repeatedly: this side first!
Just like this.
Just let them step away
before shooting, asshole.
Good, now the hospital!
What, here? Are you sure?
- You mean, that's the hut?
- It has to be the right one.
But it's totally destroyed.
Who the hell are you?
Who are you?
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
What are you doing here?
I was...
I was trying to open this tin.
- Where do you live?
- Do you work here?
- No.
What's your work?
I am...
I was a pianist.
A pianist.
Come.
Play.
Are you hiding here?
Jew?
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
Show me.
Have you anything to eat?
Achtung!
Jew?
Please. What's all that gunfire?
The Russians.
On the other side of the river.
All you have to do is hang on
for a few more weeks.
- What's happening?
- We're getting out.
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.
...I don't know how to thank you.
Don't thank me. Thank God.
It's His will that we should survive.
Well. That's what we have to believe.
Here, take this one.
- What about you?
- I've got another one. Warmer.
What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again.
On Polish Radio.
Tell me your name.
I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Szpilman...
Good name for a pianist.
German! German!
No.
Don't shoot. I'm Polish!
Please! I'm Polish! I'm...
- Come out with your hands up.
- Please, I beg you. Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, don't shoot, I beg you.
I'm Polish! I'm Polish, please.
Come down!
Please, I'm Polish! Please, please...
- He's Polish.
- Yes, I'm Polish.
Why the fucking coat?
I'm cold.
Look at them. German fuckers.
Murderers! Murderers!
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!
Look at you now!
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician! You took my violin!
You took my soul!
Musician?
- You're a musician?
- Yes.
Do you happen to know another musician,
a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!
- Polish radio?
- Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.
I helped Mr Szpilman
when he was in hiding.
Tell him I'm here.
- Ask him to help me.
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.
- What?
It was here, I'm certain of it.
It's not here now.
I shouted abuse at them,
I'm not proud of it,
and, I'm certain, I stood where you now,
there was barbed wire,
and this German came up to me.
- You didn't catch his name.
No,
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
Wiladyslaw Szpilman continued to live in
Warsaw until his death on 6th July, 2000.
He was 88 years old.
The name of the German officer
was Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.
All that is known is that he died
1952 in a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp.
