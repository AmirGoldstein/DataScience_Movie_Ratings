Our bosun's mate.
He's soaked to the gills.
The road's closed.
Who are those pigs?
The road's clear.
Coming through!
That's their fireboat drill.
They're all boys off our boat.
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!
Captain.
Merkel's guys.
They ship out tomorrow too.
Okay, sailors!
Let's go set that cathouse on fire!
Just don't miss your mark!
Stuff some season's greetings
in there!
Scared fuckers.
They need sex
like the infantry needs alcohol.
What's going on here?
Good luck!
Captain!
My 2nd officer.
This is Lieutenant Werner,
naval war correspondent.
He'll ship out with us.
He'll report anything of interest.
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.
Good evening.
This way, lieutenant.
U-boat crews need relaxation.
Good evening.
Two beers.
Yes, captain.
Where's Thomsen?
Doesn't he want
to celebrate his medal?
Any news from your wife?
No personal calls allowed
till after 10 p.m.
Two beers.
Reporting back from U-96.
Munitions and provisions aboard,
ready to put to sea.
Thanks, 1st.
Something else, captain.
On my way here...
...some of the crew harassed me.
They actually-
An incredible incident--
They--
They pissed on you.
Yes.
Me too.
Just a minute!
Attention, please!
Let's give
our newly decorated officer...
...Captain Thomsen...
...three cheers!
That's Thomsen for you.
One of the old guard.
Always drunk now.
My respects, Thomsen!
Quiet in this whorehouse!
A toast to our wonderful...
...abstaining...
...womanless Fuhrer.
Who rose gloriously...
...from apprentice painter...
...to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.
What? Isn't it true?
He's the great naval expert...
...who took it upon himself...
...in his wisdom--
How's it go again?
Who's been showing
that English bedwetter...
...that cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill...
...where to go stick...
...his cigars!
Sorry.
See you tomorrow.
I've got a call to make.
It's not like the old gang.
These are so green and eager.
Wet behind the ears.
Braggarts.
Cheeks together,
balls in their hands...
...and belief
in the Fuhrer in their eyes.
They'll calm down soon enough.
You're a pig's ass!
Fight! Win! Or Die!
Come on, Phillip, get up!
Help me here!
I wanted to...
...really...
...screw my brains out--
I am not in the condition
to fuck.
It's all right.
That's Thomsen's boat.
Equipment checks okay?
The starboard propeller had
a bent blade.
That's what caused whining
on silent runs.
We have a brand-new propeller
now, captain.
Our boat.
Crew at attention!
Captain's revue, eyes left.
Crew reporting for duty.
All decks ready to sail.
Thank you, 1st officer.
At ease!
Well, men...
Everything okay?
Yes, captain!
We have a guest.
Lieutenant Werner.
Naval correspondent.
He wants to look around...
...to watch
respectable German heroes.
Act accordingly.
Man your stations.
Hail and victory and sink them all!
Pick up those vegetables.
This is no grocery store!
Command post.
Torpedo workshop and storage.
Shape up and your mugs
will make the newspaper!
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Follow me.
This is our shit house.
One hole for fifty men.
The other's full of provisions.
More space for food
than for shit. Some logic.
Chief petty officer's.
My home, so to speak.
Here's the officers' mess.
Don't stow stuff that way!
It's nice in here.
Where are you?
Sorry, coming. May I?
Careful!
Here's the radio room.
Over here, the control room.
Just what we need.
The control room.
The boat's command centre.
This leads to quarters.
Gotta move this stuff.
Morning, lieutenant.
Petty officers sleep here.
Twelve men.
Two men share most bunks,
depending on their duties.
If one's on guard, the next one sleeps
in the other's stink. Right?
This is your bunk.
Just for you, our guest.
That's for you too.
Your oxygen mask.
Very important!
Not much good except
in calm seas.
It comes in handy
when the diesel reeks.
Or when Frenssen farts.
Come along.
Coming through!
This is the galley.
And this is Johann, the ghost.
Hey, Johann,
everything greased up?
Man on bridge?
Take photos of the crew returning...
...not putting out to sea.
Why?
They'll have beards by then.
It would shame the Brits
to see mere boys give them hell.
Baby faces...
...who should still
suck Mama's breast.
I feel ancient around these kids.
Like I'm on some Children's Crusade.
Permission to pass?
You're from Mexico?
Yes, south of Mexico City.
Nice?
Yes, sir.
Great climate,
due to the high altitude.
You came a long way.
As a German,
it was a matter of course.
What did you do there?
I worked on my step-parents'
plantation.
The boss' son?
You could put it that way.
Stand by,
first watch and engine watch.
Excuse me.
Permission to pass?
Reporting to bridge watch.
Rigid jawbones, our 1st officer.
He'll march anywhere.
A model of ideology.
He's so tense,
he could crack nuts with his ass.
Watch out. Eggs.
- Man on bridge?
- Yes.
Alarm!
All hands forward!
Come on, let's go!
Wake up, you guys!
Move that body.
Hop, hop! Let's go!
I'll kick your asses till they bleed!
That's an alarm, damn it!
This ain't a cruise ship!
Blow main dive tank.
Stern to 10.
April Fools.
Exercise is good for you.
Can't let no moss grow.
Practise drill.
Steady as she goes.
Bow up 15. Stem up 10.
Both up.
- Boat trimmed.
- Close main vents.
Vents closed.
Deeper, chief.
Let's see if these valves are tight.
Bow down 15, Stem up 10.
The shipyard rates it to 90 metres.
But we can go deeper.
Of course, there's a limit.
We can only take
so much pressure...
...before the boat's crushed.
Secure upper hatches.
- It's water pressure.
- Yes, of course.
Deeper.
140 metres.
It's gotta take it.
150.
160 metres.
That's all today.
Surface.
Bow up 10. Stem up 5.
Your girl?
French?
You know that florist next
to the Café À l'Ami Pierrot?
Where?
À l'Ami Pierrot.
Yeah, sure...
...the two salesgirls...
...Jeannette and...
What's her name?
Françoise.
We're engaged.
Secretly, of course.
May I?
Really very pretty.
What's wrong?
She's pregnant.
But...
...you know what that means.
Once the Partisans find out...
...her kid's half-German--
What can I do?
She definitely wants it.
You've got a problem.
Those guys in Berlin got nothing
but insults for Churchill.
How's it go again?
"Drunkard"...
..."Guzzler"...
..."Paralytic."
He's sending a lot of heat our way
for a paralyzed drunk.
Nonetheless...
...we'll force him to his knees.
That is my firm belief.
Listen, smart guy...
...he's far from being on his knees.
Wonder how many ships
get through.
Especially now, while we're staring
at the walls and waiting.
Where are our planes and scouts,
Herr Göring?
The enemy's got plenty.
Hot air, that's all that comes out
of that fat slob.
Braggarts, nothing but braggarts.
All of them.
Go on...
...take it down.
Notes...
...for your "Heroes' Epic"...
...and the propaganda machine.
Where's the music?
Our Hitler Youth leader here
could play us a record.
That "Tipperary" song,
if you please!
Hey, now we're the Royal Navy.
This record won't hurt...
...your ideological edifice.
Shut that bulkhead, you cockroach!
What an asshole.
We should've used him for ballast.
One day I'll rip his ass
up to his ears...
...till he can watch himself
through his own asshole.
Morning.
This stinks.
It's sweaty socks and hair grease...
...Pilgrim's special mix.
Tastes like shit, eh?
Those scrambled eggs...
...taste like baby poo-poo.
Wanna raise chickens on the boat?
And ducks in the bilge.
Tiny ones.
We could feed them
green boogers.
- You pig's ass.
- But why?
They'd love some.
Every morning...
...fat, fresh boogers.
"Personal hygiene," four letters?
Bath.
Thanks.
"Innermost affection," four letters?
Love.
Exactly.
Not too intellectual around here.
Your radiogram, captain.
Hold on.
This could work.
A new course?
Wait and see.
May I see the radiogram?
"Convoy reported,
coordinates AK 22..."
"...general course about 60 degrees..."
"...at 8 nautical miles"
"From U-37."
U-37 is Marten's boat.
He's after a convoy.
Too far away. Can't make it.
Damn this waiting!
Will we ever see some action?
Move it, you turtle!
Let's hear your bones crack!
Pull them out of the cosy Lady.
Pretty big johnnies, huh?
Move it, lazybones!
The press!
Let me get that. Hold it. Very nice.
Greased up nice with Vaseline...
...and rammed back into the Lady.
Don't let me get in your way.
One more! Good.
And another.
A bit to the left.
Maybe a profile shot.
Another pose, a little to the--
Who did that?
Who did that?
Tell me...
...you got hairs in your nose?
Why?
Because I've got some in my ass.
We can tie them together.
Françoise, my love...
...this is my 14th letter,
but you've yet to see one.
20th day at sea.
Feeling foggy and overfed.
It's all so crazy.
Alarm!
All ahead full!
Flood tanks!
I saw a shadow off starboard
through the rain.
Take her down to 30 metres.
Stern up slowly, bow down 10.
Anything off starboard?
Propeller sounds.
110 degrees.
Way aft of us.
Contact getting fainter.
Fading fast.
We'll stay under.
Steer 120 degrees.
That's a fast, lone ship.
We've got no chance in the dark.
"Attention to personal hygiene
and dress are not just appearances."
"It reflects an upright,
clean interior..."
"...thus influencing the surroundings."
"The true officer is unpretentious..."
"...in character and wardrobe..."
"...which was not always the case..."
"...when superiors were more lenient..."
"...because a German lieutenant
always knew how to die."
Comfy place, huh?
No mail, no phones.
A well-ventilated boat.
Attractive wood panelling.
Free home cooking.
We're sitting in clover.
Like horse droppings.
It sits in clover too.
It doesn't worry about anything...
...and it gets to let off steam.
U-boat special cocktail.
Envious?
Turn it off!
These latest radiograms...
"Dived avoiding aircraft."
"Dived avoiding destroyer
depth charges."
Those Brits
don't make mistakes anymore.
Watch fuel flow!
Okay.
Let's get to the diesel room!
Watch out!
- Tough times, huh?
- What's up?
U-32, Berthold'S boat...
...discovered a convoy.
We'll be there in 10 hours.
Listen up.
We're in pursuit
of a convoy tracked by U-32.
Expect contact at 1800 hours.
I hope we blast off some eels.
It'll clear some space!
More than 30 freighters!
Berthold better not attack now.
Ought to stay close
until the other boats arrive.
There is nothing more beautiful
than a submarine...
...and a sailboat.
There are no better lines
than those of a sailboat.
I sailed on a 3-masted schooner once.
Gorgeous ship.
It had holds the size
of a cathedral!
That burns some fuel, huh?
Asshole.
Shitty fog, damn it!
Watch out or else we'll sail
right by them.
Should have made Contact by now.
Why's there no signal
from Berthold?
Why no word from headquarters?
Visibility nil, captain.
It's useless!
Prepare to take her down!
Get below!
Take her down to 30 metres.
Bow up 10.
Stern down 5.
Bow zero.
Stern zero.
What's happening?
Why are we diving?
Hydrophone check.
You hear more down here
than you can see up there.
No contact, nothing?
Nothing at all?
Contact, bearing 60 degrees.
Quite faint.
Depth charges.
They're blasting someone.
What's their exact bearing now?
Forty-five degrees, moving right.
Moving away.
Surface!
Steer 330 degrees.
Entry for your log book.
Commenced operation
despite weather.
Damn this weather!
What's it look like?
Just a moment.
Enemy's position here,
if they haven't zig-zagged.
Vessel! Starboard ahead!
Forty degrees, over that way!
See it.
That's no freighter.
That's a damn destroyer.
Approaching.
Get below.
Flood tanks!
Periscope depth.
Stand by battle stations.
Move!
Go! Go! Faster!
Watch out, chief.
Flood tubes 1 to 4.
He wants to attack the destroyer.
That's madness in this weather.
Watch our depth!
Bow up 2.
Stern down 2.
Gently.
Bow average...
...13.5 metres.
Open torpedo hatches.
Enemy speed: 12.
Bow angle: 30.
Range: 6,000.
Depth: 2.
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread shots from tubes 1 and 3.
Angle: 3 degrees.
Tubes 1 to 4 ready to fire.
Damn.
Close hatches! Dive fast!
Depth charges!
Quick, get fuses!
Check outboard valves.
Control room secured.
All clear forward.
No serious damages.
They actually spotted our periscope.
Hard to believe in this heavy sea.
Getting any louder?
The same. Ahead of us.
It's pulling further ahead.
295 degrees.
Left full rudder.
Rudder is left full.
Steer due north.
Deeper.
Bow down 15. Stem up 10.
Pump 200 litres forward.
All ahead one-third.
Now it all turns psychological,
gentlemen.
Check torpedo tubes!
Stay calm, men.
That ain't nothing yet.
Kill the lights.
Silent run.
Both engines 50 r.p.m.
Contact closing.
Ahead, 52 degrees.
Approaching fast.
Midships.
All full ahead. Right full rudder.
Heading straight for us!
Those aren't amateurs
up there. Deeper!
Bow down 20.
Stern up 5.
Destroyer approaching.
Getting louder.
Deeper, quickly.
Don't worry.
It's just creaking.
Deeper.
Stern up 15.
Tighten that flange!
Higher! To 150 metres!
Hurry! Bow up 20!
Come on, tighter!
Push already! Do it, do it!
Hull valves secured.
Both level.
Boat trimmed at 150 metres.
Getting closer.
New approach.
Come on, come on.
They're above us.
Directly above us.
Contact fading to starboard.
Twenty-two.
Twenty-three.
Far away.
Fading aft.
Barely audible.
No more contact.
That's the end of that.
Silent run.
Both engines, 50 r.p.m.
From my private collection.
Engine room damages?
A lot of smashed stuff.
- Can you fix it?
- It's in the works.
Make sure it's done right.
I've got a hunch we're going
to see action.
It's been almost an hour.
We got rid of them, captain.
We'll see.
Maybe they're just lying
in wait for us...
...until we feel safe enough
to surface.
These guys aren't stupid.
Continue silent run.
We'll surface at dark.
Then we'll see.
She's coming up fast.
Hydrophone check at 30 metres.
She's at 30 metres.
Periscope depth.
Periscope clear.
Stern down 5.
Coming UP-
Stern up 3.
Zero.
Surface.
Blow tanks.
What a cutie pie.
If Mama could see you now.
Quiet in this whorehouse!
Bad news, guys.
What's going on?
Soccer. Schalke.
We lost, 5-0.
No chance to make the semi-finals.
I can't believe this shit!
Drop them.
You pig.
Crabs.
A whole army of crabs.
They'll eat little guys
like you to the bone.
Give that hussy some puffy!
Permission to pass?
Ought to shave this pig, huh?
What's that in your eyebrows?
Pardon?
You'd better see the medic.
You've got the crabs.
Are you joking?
Once they crawl up there,
it's really far gone.
Number One.
Lieutenant?
Where's the medic?
In the bow.
This can't be true!
Watch your sector.
What?
Pull yourself together!
Have you gone crazy?
Have you heard?
Dufte is engaged.
Poor woman!
Asshole!
I thought he only jerks off.
Yeah, breed him
with a chimp at the zoo.
Here are photos of his lady.
Give them back!
I can't believe it.
You screw this bag?
This boat can take it.
You should be
in a storm on a schooner.
You don't feel a thing down here.
Compass.
The boat's heaving to starboard.
I can barely keep her on course.
Don't worry about it.
We're hardly moving.
We're just burning fuel.
Prepare to dive.
Diving stations!
Flooding tanks.
All main vents clear.
No tales of victory, huh?
Just some position reports.
SOS calls from far-off boats.
If anyone breaks a rudder
in this weather...
...they better start praying.
The sea can't drown us, though.
There's no ship
as seaworthy as ours.
Play that record.
You know which one.
Watch out!
Man overboard!
Hold on!
Move! Hold onto him!
Put him on the chart box!
Get the medic case!
Damn it!
The medic case, damn it!
Prepare to dive!
"A military leader leads
through self-discipline."
"Without his example,
education is impossible."
Three broken ribs,
one open wound.
Could be worse.
Shitty month.
Real shitty.
Mildew is good for you.
It's the next best thing...
...to fresh lettuce.
Let's be grateful
for anything that grows here.
They'll have snow back home now.
Funny.
I haven't seen snow in years.
May I?
By all means.
Your wife?
Over there, ahead!
Captain, U-boat, port ahead!
German boat, German U-boat!
Bearing 350 degrees.
Almost straight ahead!
God, you're right!
All engines stop.
Get that signal lamp up!
That's Thomsen!
All back half.
Happy hunting, you old sea dog!
Phillip, my friend.
So they kicked you out here again.
God damn mess!
Only 12 boats in the Atlantic.
From Greenland to the Azores,
a lousy dozen!
And here we are,
almost ramming into each other.
Sixty metres. Boat is trimmed.
Something's wrong here.
Our position's correct?
More or less, captain.
What's that supposed to mean?
Not one sun shot in two weeks.
And we've drifted in this storm.
Hard to calculate.
That's just great.
All of us "more or less"
in position...
...and it'll happen.
Two boats in one place
and gaping holes in the route.
The British can slide
a whole fleet through.
Here in the middle of the sea,
it's always another story.
I hope you're taking notes.
Maybe you can clue headquarters in.
Surely, you have better
connections than me.
You think so, huh?
What's going on?
Convoy.
- Man on bridge?
- Affirmative.
Convoy putting to sea.
Five columns.
Real big show.
You see any escort?
Destroyers?
Nope, nothing.
No security. Nothing.
Strange.
Are they chasing one of ours
on the other side?
Damn moonlight.
- How many of ours are here?
- Five.
Shall we risk it?
I think so, captain.
Port to 180 degrees.
New course...
...port to 180 degrees.
How's it feel to you, Kriechbaum?
It will work, captain. For sure.
Tubes 1 to 4,
prepare for surface firing.
Flood tubes 1 to 4.
I'll take the helm.
Target optics to bridge.
All ahead full,
port to 107 degrees.
Commencing attack!
Watch the oil pressure!
Bow right, position 50.
Check.
Range: 2200.
Those two that overlap...
...double blast the fat one,
single shots for the other.
Tracking target.
All ahead one-third.
Open torpedo hatches.
Tubes 1 and 2 coordinates:
Target bearing 63.
Sights adjusted.
Keep tracking target.
Target acquisition.
Tubes 1 and 2...
...fire at will.
Tube 1, fire!
Tube 2.
Tube 3, stand by.
Fire!
Tube 4 ready.
Fire!
Destroyer dead ahead!
They're firing!
Alarm!
Bow up 10, Stem up 5.
Quiet, damn it!
Down to 80 metres.
Slowly.
Bow down 15, Stem up 10.
What's with the torpedoes?
Wait and see.
The party is about to start.
Hundred ten.
Hundred twenty.
Shitty torpedoes.
Tracking is off again.
The old man crazy, or what?
Just charges right in.
Like some speedboat attack.
They'll rip our asses open now.
Got that one.
Yeah, boys, we got one!
Quiet now!
Time's up for third torpedo.
Number three.
Two going down.
Their bulkheads are breaking.
They're drowning.
Here it comes...
...their revenge.
Destroyer bearing 44 degrees.
Any movement?
Moving left...
...fading.
Right full rudder.
All ahead one-half.
Astern of us.
Way astern of us.
They're spitting at the wrong spot.
We aren't rid of them yet.
I guess they're a bit upset.
Destroyer contact.
Contact bearing 270 and closing.
All ahead one-third.
Here they come.
All ahead full!
Dump 150 litres!
Asdic.
[Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee]
Ancestor of active sonar.
Ultrasonic detection system.
Pigs. Rotten pigs.
Damages?
Air shaft fractured.
Quiet. Keep quiet.
Silent run.
Fifty r.p.m. Shut off ventilators.
Port 15.
All ahead full!
Shut it off!
Shut down auxiliary control panel!
Connect ventilation cartridges.
Start ventilators, connect cartridges.
They ain't kidding.
They really want to shake us up.
So that was all?
Calling it a day?
Boy, we really gave it to them...
...when those bulkheads broke
to pieces.
What's the bearing?
Steady at 65 degrees.
Deeper. Silent run.
New bearing?
Fifty degrees.
Growing louder.
Come on.
Still deeper.
Three degrees starboard.
Let's throw them...
...for another little loop.
Bow steady. Stern up 10.
Contact bearing 270 degrees.
Fading.
Right full rudder.
Rudder is full right.
To 90 degrees.
Shit.
Second propeller sounds, 76 degrees.
Closing fast.
Reinforcements.
Those bastards.
Deeper.
Deeper still.
Bow down 10.
Stern up 7.
190 metres.
200 metres.
210 metres.
220 metres.
230 metres.
The bolts! They're bursting!
Keep the boat from dropping!
Up 10 metres!
All ahead one-half!
Quiet, men, quiet.
Go to 150 metres! All ahead full!
Port 20!
Steer 50 degrees!
Pretty good shooting, mister.
Quiet, damn it!
I want proper damage reports!
Permission to check diesel?
Take over the helm!
Gaskets! Half-inch, hurry!
Where are you?
I need those gaskets!
Torpedo hatch taking water!
Tools! Hurry!
The more they throw,
the sooner they run out.
Leakage above
exhaust vent repaired.
150 metres, all ahead full.
What's the matter?
Return to your battle station.
At once!
Pull yourself together!
Back!
Go back, Johann.
Take him aft, quickly!
He's gone, captain.
Why Johann, of all people?
Despicable.
Shameless.
Forget the headset.
We can hear it anyway.
Come on, let's go.
Boat dropping!
190 metres!
220 metres!
We're drowning!
Take this down for your log book.
After 6 hours of silent run...
...it seems certain...
...the enemy destroyers lost us.
At 210 degrees...
...very heavy fire blazing.
Assume it to be the tanker we hit.
Surface in 10 minutes.
See, lieutenant...
...they didn't kill us after all.
Her backbone is broken.
Damn tough ship, won't drown.
Let's get to it.
Target optics to bridge.
Flood tube 1.
Enemy movement nil.
Range: 650 metres.
Depth 4, torpedo speed 30.
Target point,
directly before aft mast.
Tube 1 ready.
Fire!
Men still on board!
Why weren't they rescued?
Damn it!
After all these hours!
They're swimming for us.
All back one-half!
Can I clear this?
Radiograms.
Read them.
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoys dispersed."
"Lost contact."
"In pursuit at 30 degrees."
"From U-112."
That's Wenzel.
Not bad.
Kupsch pursuing same convoy.
Stackmann hit a 6000 tonner.
Quite a battlefield.
Can we get there?
Difficult.
At least 5 hours away.
Our fuel--
- We couldn't do 5--
- All right, already!
When do we turn back?
When I give the order...
...navigator.
Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast.
Crew, assumed rescued,
was still on board.
Survivors swam toward U-96.
I want to apologise.
You can't just apologise.
You left your battle station
at a critical time.
Also, you disobeyed my order.
Will I be court-martialled?
How many war patrols for you?
It's my ninth.
You, of all people, Johann.
It's never happened before.
My nerves cracked somehow.
It won't happen again.
You can count on me.
I swear.
All right, Johann.
No court martial?
Go on to bed.
U-96 withdrew from survivors.
Decision: return to base 0700.
Second officer!
You'll fix it.
It's the bulkhead conduit.
It'll work.
Morning.
Get moving, signal to decode.
More top secrets.
Another special goose chase.
Not us.
We're ready for the wharf.
And the fuel...
We won't even make La Rochelle.
- The last 100 miles-
- We'll set sail.
We'll be all right, chief.
How's it coming?
What you got?
"For captain's eyes only."
That's a first.
Triple coded.
Yeah.
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Gonna get laid again.
All of those sexy nurses...
...hot telephone operators,
all those warm bodies.
Screwing like mad.
A nice, slow afternoon fuck.
- Attention.
- Our master's voice.
La Rochelle's out.
We've been ordered to a new port.
La Spezia...
...in the Mediterranean.
Fuel and provisions out of Vigo first.
That's in Spain.
That is all.
Those bastards stuck it to us.
Shit.
No getting laid.
No sexy nurses.
No hot telephone operators.
Horse shit!
Christmas with the Macaronis.
Got to get there first, stupid!
What do you mean?
Gibraltar!
Stick a finger up your ass
to get the idea.
It's as tight as a virgin.
We'll need Vaseline to get through.
The Mediterranean.
They're nuts.
It's swarming
with English combat ships.
Stand by for calculations!
Zero...
...25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.
Gibraltar.
Excellent prospects for drowning.
You and the chief will go ashore
in Vigo.
How's that?
I'll radio it in a minute.
I'll have to find a replacement
for the chief.
They'll smuggle you
through Spain somehow...
...even if you have
to dress like gypsies.
- But I was on for the whole--
- No heroics.
It's already settled.
One guy alone would be tough.
We've got agents to get you through.
Chief's wife is very ill.
He's got to go ashore.
Aye, aye, sir.
Pretty bad, huh?
I'm going ashore at Vigo...
...with the chief.
Captain's orders.
Want me to take your letters?
But it's a big pile.
Well, it's a big love, right?
Equalize pressure.
All quiet.
White light.
Watch where you stomp.
Quiet, man!
We've got to find the right tub here.
The "Weser"...
...a German merchant vessel,
is interned here.
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and provisions.
Just for us.
Yeah, 1st class service.
Starboard engine stop.
We've arrived.
Port engine stop.
Officers to bridge.
Watch out on deck.
Gentlemen.
We welcome our heroic
German U-boat crew.
A wholehearted welcome...
...captain.
No, please, not me.
This is the captain.
My apologies.
Welcome aboard the "Weser,"
captain.
A real hero, in person.
I am most delighted.
Well, gentlemen...
...here they are...
...heroes of the deep.
The famous grey wolves...
...with us,
inside our modest cabin...
...so to speak.
Captain, allow me.
A warm welcome.
Nice tugboat you've got here.
We're well prepared...
...in all modesty, of course,
but not bad at all.
Like a taste of home,
so to speak.
Fresh bread,
cakes from our own bakery...
...bacon, fresh sausages,
stuffed just today, naturally.
You've got to tell us your news.
You can't imagine our curiosity.
It's not an easy life here,
appearances to the contrary.
There's plenty of fuel and food
to eat...
...but torpedoes are difficult
to come by.
But we always have our ways.
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but there's no love lost between us.
Christmas bread.
So, tell me...
...how many ships have you sunk?
Let me guess--
The champagne.
How forgetful of me.
Please.
Gentlemen.
We drink to your health.
We are so proud of you.
We toast the German U-boats...
...and our beloved Füh...
I forget we're not at home here...
...if you know what I mean.
Cheers.
To your health.
Come on, dig in.
Let's dive into this stuff.
Come, captain, tell us all.
We're so very curious.
Those are fresh figs.
Never had one before.
Quiet, gentlemen.
They almost had us this time.
Phenomenal.
You see,
that's the language of a hero.
To-the-point. Simply phenomenal.
But you can't get away that easily.
Hand me that. Herring salad.
Our cook's speciality.
You must try it.
Come on now, taste it.
How's it feel beneath the surface...
...submerged...
...while the enemy lurks above?
Dark.
And real quiet.
As long as nobody farts.
Pardon me?
- As long as--
- He means, on silent runs...
...the crew must show
extreme discipline.
And that's why nobody can fart.
Herr Seewald,
we've been expecting you.
The delegate of the naval attache.
I have messages from headquarters.
But first,
your orders for Gibraltar.
And this radiogram.
Chief, Lieutenant Werner.
We're taking a stroll.
What's going on?
Bad news.
Request was denied
by headquarters.
You've got to stay on board.
You too, lieutenant.
I'm sorry.
It's probably just as well.
Who knows who they'd
replace me with?
Might be one of those
wet-behind-the-ears kids.
Very well could be.
They should've put some pussy
in storage for screwing.
Yeah, you'd be fighting
Spanish crabs by now.
Better than blue balls!
Move it and clear the chart table.
I can't navigate on bananas.
Are you nuts? Move that fruit.
The depth controls are blocked.
That's a Christmas tree?
It ain't camouflage for the bridge.
We're staying on board.
Orders from headquarters.
Sorry, Ullman.
Seven miles between coasts.
A tight squeeze, I'd say.
These are the British docks.
Their only port for repairs
in the western Mediterranean.
It will be well protected.
All kinds of defences.
Anything floating will be
on the water.
We'll have to manoeuver through it.
That's the situation.
We'll move under cover
of darkness...
...skimming the surface.
We'll cut right
through the English ships.
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar
as we can get.
Then we'll dive...
...and let ourselves drop.
Dive...
...then float with the current
through the strait.
No racket.
It saves fuel.
So, Kriechbaum?
Not bad, captain.
Let's go.
All ahead one-half.
Navigator and I stay,
everyone else clear the bridge.
Half the English fleet is here.
Two degrees to port.
Switch to electric motor.
Destroyer across port.
Range: 800, running parallel.
What's he doing?
Closing in?
No, moving ahead.
Very good.
Left full rudder.
All ahead full.
All right, then.
Right full rudder! All ahead full.
Damn!
Gibraltar.
We'll dive in 10 minutes.
Alarm!
Flood tanks!
Watch out, don't dive!
- Captain's still on bridge!
- Kriechbaum's wounded!
Both diesels ahead full!
Blow all tanks!
Prepare to abandon ship!
Medic to officers' mess immediately!
Where's the medic?
Maximum power!
Right full rudder!
All men into rescue gear!
Prepare to abandon!
Hold this!
Faster, faster!
Get a compress!
Gotta shut down port diesel.
It's pulled loose.
Keep full speed!
Give it everything she's got!
What's he going to do?
Southern course...
...moving toward the African coast.
Damn.
Flood tanks!
All men to bow!
Down to 90 metres.
- Bow plane jammed!
- Use manual rudder!
Bow plane stuck
in full down position!
Both engines stop.
All men aft!
Hurry! Faster!
Trim all to stem!
Ballast pump down!
Trim with air!
Still sinking.
Load unchanged.
Gotta lose weight!
Pump 1000 litres!
Shut him up, medic!
Main pump down!
Blow tanks?
All back full!
Boat not responding.
Blow tanks. Blow tanks!
Blow front.
Stop now.
Why don't you stop!
Give it whatever she's got, chief!
Blow them all!
Come on up.
Boat is beyond control.
200.
210.
220 metres.
Beyond 230.
240 metres.
250 metres.
My God.
Do not turn...
...Thy face away from me.
A shovelful of sand.
God threw a shovelful
of sand beneath our keel.
280 metres.
This boat's amazing.
Torpedo hatch taking water!
Taking water behind control panel!
Taking water in motor bilge!
Tube 5 taking water!
What you need?
- Leakage plugs.
- In the bow.
Exhaust valve?
Leakage plugs! Move!
Give me that lamp!
I need a wrench, damn it!
Where are my reports?
Taking water at tower frame!
Where are the tools?
- Where is it?
- Bilge pump!
Motor control panels down!
Diesel's all busted!
I demand proper reports!
Where's it worst?
Shaft valves and housing.
Machinist, battery two...
...determine damages.
Don't strip the crankshafts.
Can't see a thing!
Push harder!
I'm pushing!
Can't get the wedge in!
Give me that hammer!
Need more men aft?
I'll find out!
- Damn it.
- Can I help?
Hold the light!
Father, don't forsake us.
Stupid asshole!
Damn idiot.
I need the diesel room toolbox.
Hurry!
Where are the tools?
Bigger wrench!
Leakage in diesel bilge!
Tighten them carefully.
Don't break the bolts.
Cooling pipe leaking!
Get down there
and tighten those valves!
Give me that timber!
More plugs...hurry!
Gently, men.
Taking water fast in stem.
All hull valves burst.
Cooling system down.
Compressors dislodged.
Shaft valves taking water.
What about fuel leaks?
Can't tell yet.
- Anything else?
- Battery cells are cracked.
They can't take this.
Acid in the bilge.
Neutralise with lime wash.
Count drained cells.
Get battery connectors, hurry!
Over here!
I need plugs and a hammer!
- Here it is.
- Thanks, lieutenant.
Calm down.
Tell the chief.
Taking water in motor room.
Rising above torpedo tubes.
Careful.
Twenty-four cells drained.
Twenty-four cells. Holy shit.
We're way short of connectors.
He's got to bridge
those damaged cells.
Or else we've had it.
Can't tighten it. Can't see.
Lieutenant, lights!
If we don't fix this, we're goners!
To the right, more to the right.
Wire.
I need wire for bridging.
Move it, we need wire.
Hurry up.
The chief needs wire.
Look for wire.
Move it. Search for wire.
Incredible torpedoes in these tubes.
Twenty-five thousand Marks apiece.
And we can't find...
...a piece of wire.
Some old wire worth 50 pennies.
Periscope hydraulics jammed.
Can't be moved manually, either.
Wire.
Finally, something.
Pliers!
Leaks stopped.
Good, Johann.
Really good.
Now, get out of those wet rags.
Now let's get it out.
This water's got to go.
First, into the control room bilge...
...and then out.
Faster. Let's get rid of it.
And scoop. And scoop.
Get with it.
No falling asleep back there.
Three more cells starboard.
Where do we stand?
Almost done. Three cells to go.
Make way for the chief.
Entire compass system is down...
...probably the sonar too.
Radio is totally out.
Quite a mess.
Can we surface?
Any chance at all?
Good question.
Some air may be left
in the ballast tanks...
...from all that blowing.
That might help us.
With every last bit of air pressure...
...maybe-—
We've got to reduce our weight.
That water has to get out.
Might work. It just might!
Aft is almost bailed.
It could work...
...by hand into tanks...
...then with main pump...
...and air pressure,
the water's pushed out.
Main pump?
Can do.
Then we go for broke.
Blow tanks, and-—
We'll get only one try.
When?
Once everything's repaired.
In 6 to 8 hours.
- CO2 content?
- 1.8 percent.
We got enough oxygen?
No.
Pass out oxygen masks as needed...
...men off duty to their bunks.
How's he doing?
Hard to tell.
Doesn't look good.
So, Pilgrim...
...all okay?
Yes, captain.
It's all okay.
How are things aft?
Moving along, captain.
Guess I'll show my face then, huh?
Be careful.
All right here?
Okay. Doing fine.
Sure, captain. It'll work out.
How's it going?
Got to change two more bearings.
Do you want some glucose?
Crazy idea...
...to ram us through this strait.
It was bound to go wrong.
He knew it.
That old fox knew it all along.
Since he got that radiogram...
...ordering us to break through.
That's why
he wanted us off the boat...
...in Vigo.
There was no chance to get through.
He wanted to make us believe
it was possible...
...with a simple trick.
"Drop down and glide through"--
Not a bad trick...
...except that it had to work.
Will we ever surface, chief?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Is it hopeless?
It's been 15 hours.
He's not going to pull it off.
I'm sorry.
I asked for it.
"To be heading into the inexorable..."
"...where no mother will care for us..."
"...no woman crosses our path..."
"...where only reality reigns,
with cruelty and grandeur."
I was drunk with those words.
Well, this is reality.
Reporting to the captain.
Electric motor fixed.
Main pump fixed.
Water can be pumped into tanks...
...then blown out
with compressed air.
Compass ready.
Sonar ready.
Good, chief.
Take a rest now.
Still got a few small problems.
All you need is good people.
Good people.
Listen up.
We're going to blow tanks now...
...to see if we can lift our butt.
If we do...
...it might get uncomfortable again.
Lots of traffic up there.
So all we can do...
...is pray those diesels start up.
Then full speed ahead
and off we go...
...out of this crater...
...and back home.
If it works...
...half a bottle of beer for everyone.
We just might get lucky.
They're not expecting us.
Well, men...
...are we ready?
Contact bearings?
No contact.
Prepare to surface,
rescue gear ready.
Switch to red lights.
Man your diving stations.
Blow tanks.
Boat rising!
Quiet men! Calm down!
270 metres.
First watch, get ready.
260 metres.
250 metres.
240 metres.
230 metres.
220.
Hatch is open.
How about the engines?
Both diesels.
Now everything hinges on this.
I think...
...it's running!
Who says you can't make something
out of nothing?
They won't get us this time.
Not again!
Hang in there, damn it.
Hang in there!
Three degrees to starboard.
Course 320 degrees.
There he goes again!
They don't notice us.
They're all asleep in their bunks.
No, you know what?
They're at the casino,
celebrating our sinking!
Cheers, guys!
Here's to getting home!
As long as the diesels hold up...
...and with a little bit of luck...
...we'll make it home.
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
our returning sailors.
All engines stop.
Let go aft line.
We Build For Victory!
- Thanks, Hinrich.
- Don't mention it.
The sun's shining.
Lift it!
All right? Almost there.
