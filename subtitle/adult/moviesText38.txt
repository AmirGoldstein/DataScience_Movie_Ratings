<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're screwed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more free wi-fi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Ki-jung!
- Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lady upstairs put
a password on 'iptime'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A password?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you try 123456789?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it the other way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried that too!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kim Ki-taek.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our phones are shut off.
Now our wifi is shut off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For wifi, hold it high.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick it in every corner and so on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn stink bugs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here! I got it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You got a signal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, see?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one, 'coffeeland 2G'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a new cafe open?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I get it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climb up here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does it work?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then check WhatsApp.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it is. Pizza Generation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Check this out, guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we can get paid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Fumigation?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They still do that kind of thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the window.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill the stink bugs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, too many stink bugs
these days...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, that smells!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to shut it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I shut it, Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is the problem?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this one as an example.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this a straight line?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why's it folded here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this sticking up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even fold it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quarter of them look like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So 1 out of 4 are rejects.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're really docking
10% off our pay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not some minor issue.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brand? You can't even afford
a box folder!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all because
of that guy, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What guy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know all that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sister knows the guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which, Boss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll accept a 10% penalty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, we need someone!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on a sec.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me think about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're all gathered here today,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this bounteous wi-fi!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you put up
a 'No Urinating' sign?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, signs like that
just make them piss even more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least shout at him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shout.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Please don't piss!"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is that Min?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey mister, that's not a toilet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way to go, Min.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, punk!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you staring at, asshole?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here! You little shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a fucking grip!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an impressive friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">College students have
a real vigor to them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not like my brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh hi, Min!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you well, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sure.
- What are you doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I texted you. Didn't you see it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, were you eating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we weren't eating.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could've met outside,
why come here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for you,
but it's so heavy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Put it down here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, what is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a landscape type?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can see it
as an abstract type.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you know these!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks
since his cadet days.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is filled with these things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so metaphorical.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food would be better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that called?
A landscape stone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You collect those rocks too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thanks to that rock
I saw your parents, they look healthy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't afford lessons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cute, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the one you're tutoring?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take over
as her English tutor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a nice girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your university friends?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why ask a loser like me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the thought makes me sick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's revolting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like her?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you take care of
her until then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's you,
I can leave in peace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your trust,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do I have to pretend to be
a college student?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, think about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For years including
your military service,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you took the university entrance
exam 4 times.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it comes to English,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I guess so.
- Sure!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just fake it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How should I describe the mother...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a bit simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young and simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you agree?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you said
your sister is artistic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good at Photoshop?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, no smoking in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the cherry on top...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, does Oxford have
a major in document forgery?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung would be top of her class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's amazing, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go to this university
next year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've got a plan!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just printed out the document
a bit early.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who is it?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame? Good afternoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here on Min's recommendation...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh right, come in.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Madame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just work here.
Come this way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The yard is so nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The inside's nice too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used to live in this house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He designed it himself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see,
now it's a playpen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here.
The tutoring candidate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care about documents.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min recommended you, after all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye and I were quite happy
with him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was marvelous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you're not up
to Min's level, then,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure
what the point is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So anyway,
what I want to say is,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it okay with you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure about #24?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye, you solved those later problems
then went back to #24.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The heart doesn't lie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An exam is like slashing through
a jungle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lose that momentum
and you're finished.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer to #24?
I don't care.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all I care about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you need is vigor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vigor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'll pay you
this time each month.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the fee,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a proper introduction?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kevin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you feel like snacking
during your lesson, just call me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you need anything, ask her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She knows this house better than I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, stop it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, did he startle you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How cute. His name's Da-song?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, our youngest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, come say hi!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Mr. Kevin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indians?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a fanboy personality?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he can barely sit still!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hoping he'd learn moderation
and focus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's even worse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,
maybe that's why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strong, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got an eye for this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a chimpanzee, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A self-portrait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure enough!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of them lasts even a month.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Da-song is just so hard
to control.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone just came to mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was her name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica! Right, Jessica...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was in the same art school
as my cousin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was her Korean name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she returned to Korea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illinois... tell me more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her teaching is unusual,
but she knows how to handle kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got a special reputation
in her field.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But even though
her methods are unique,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she can help kids get
into good art schools.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to meet her?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though I heard she's
in high demand...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this mosaic arrangement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gochujang is red, the rice...
well, anyway,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How exciting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure Miss Jessica
must have already sensed this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice lesson, Jessica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, thank you for the introduction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we'll start with #38?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that Da-song is
faking it all?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all a show.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acting like a genius,
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An artist cosplay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that thing,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he freezes and stares at the sky,
as if struck by inspiration.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he's walking along, then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you know what I mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gives me the creeps.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He pretends that he can't live
a normal life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me want to puke.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Da-song is pretending...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what's that got to do
with your studies?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm just saying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, so in that sense,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you told me
about Da-song was very interesting,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so let's write about it
in English.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And be sure to use the word 'pretend'
at least twice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, can I ask you a question?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That teacher Jessica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she really your cousin's classmate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's your girlfriend, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way... I just met her today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you interested?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw her?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you are interested.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if we can compare Jessica
to a rose,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you are...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's study.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, get up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your butt...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Madame, please leave us.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never teach with a parent
in the room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait downstairs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park Da-song?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want some plum extract?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that would be great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got an idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take two glasses of plum
extract to Da-song's room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not a parent,
so you can go in!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll report back on
what's going on in there...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I think of it earlier?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They came out?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're done already?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come sit next to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, go upstairs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song just painted this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather speak with Madame alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but she is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, leave us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I study art psychology
and art therapy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be frank,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to hear about this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What to do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lower-right region of a painting is
called the 'schizophrenia zone'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, phrenia...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song painted this unusual shape,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's correct.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've stared at that painting
at every meal!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I had no idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to
open that box with me, Madame?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to open it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions
per week,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of that my rate is
set at a very high level.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay with that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my pleasure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's dad is home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, Da-song's new art teacher
is here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Jessica! This is Dong-ik.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Class is over?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, just finished.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give her a lift, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Jessica?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mind if it's far away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like it's going to rain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ride the Benz, not the subway!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benzes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You worked as a valet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in that 6-month window?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was after the cake shop
went bust.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're moving
to the next stage already?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I set a trap in the Benz.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we're diving right in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this is so metaphorical.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look Dad, we're eating in
a driver's cafeteria right now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, a driver's cafeteria!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat as much as you want, kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even pay for it,
they did!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, have some more.
Eat up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat your fill!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do
to that woman yesterday?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was freaking out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, I don't know!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then suddenly she's weeping.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're home?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you eat yet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is something wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the housekeeper out?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's walking the dogs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was under my car seat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know
he was this kind of guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you pay him well?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he saving up by not paying
for a motel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be a pervert.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He likes it in the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why in my car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you know
what's strangest of all?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually if you have car sex,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how can you forget
your own panties?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.
It's hard to overlook.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh my</i>... meth or cocaine?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! The kids...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if anyone finds white powder
in your car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down, relax.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no need to call the police.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So instead...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to mention panties
or car sex.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely not!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if he goes online
and accuses us...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give him a good severance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was Da-song today?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So class is finished?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, the last time you came,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our driver gave you a ride,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This may be an odd question,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but nothing happened then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he was very nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him
to go to Hyehwa Station,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he insisted
on driving me home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That jerk!
He took you home late at night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Revealing where you live?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I got off at Hyehwa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good girl. Very good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica nice...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did something happen with him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What incident?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't need to know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, you're too young
and innocent!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a lot to learn
about people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we were excited to have such
a young, hip driver, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But isn't an older driver better?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father's brother had
a driver just like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know a man like that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, he was so mild-mannered.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but my relatives relocated
to Chicago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if Mr.
Kim's free now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't trust anyone now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really want to meet him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm deadly serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This chain of recommendations
is best.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How should I describe it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A belt of trust?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one's different.
- Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a touch screen now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking our time, are we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a nice car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it!
Come over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a meeting now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a seat and wait here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, nice to meet...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is it compatible
with a phone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem to know the roads well?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything below the 38th parallel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... the head of a household,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the leader of a company?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's companionship of a sort,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that's how I've approached each day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The years sure pass quickly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Right.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but then she went on to work
for this family.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When the architect moved out,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>telling them, "This is a great housekeeper,
you should hire her."</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She won't give up
a good job easily.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we need a plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not ask for some?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So according to
what Da-hye told me,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>has trouble breathing, asthma,
a total meltdown!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I'm saying!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually when I get symptoms
like this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I run to my room
and take my medicine,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's our housekeeper!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's true. Oh, how sad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't sure
if that was really her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was in the hospital?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few days ago I went
for my annual medical exam.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she talking
on the phone there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway. I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but her words
came through clearly!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, your emotions are up
to here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring them down to
about there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so I couldn't help
but overhear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it focused!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she was shouting
on the phone,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so upset she could
barely control herself!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuberculosis?
Come on...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do people still get TB?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feels like a bygone era.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I saw it on the internet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a kid like Da-song
in the house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it, please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad: Arriving in 3 mins</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>2nd floor sauna room</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Don't let her see you</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have a seat.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he hears I brought
a TB patient to our home,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be hanged and quartered!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Madame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I may presume
to say one thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no feelings
against that woman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt I had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this could be
seen as snitching or...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you worry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't mention the TB.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simply and quietly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a proven method.
That's the best.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you... washed your hands?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere close by.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why such a craving
for braised ribs today?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who quit this week?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife wouldn't even tell me
why she quit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She kept the house
in great shape,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she knew never
to cross the line.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stand people
who cross the line.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps just one weak point?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eating too much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always ate enough for two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But considering all the work
she did...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in trouble now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a week, our house will be
a trash can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My clothes will start
to smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife has no talent for housework.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, you love her, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. I love her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll call it love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then would this help?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Care?
What is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just recently found out
about them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell from the card
they're high-class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool design.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how do you know
about this company?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might say they scouted me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You turned down this famous company
to work for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't forget that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's why I brought it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to mention me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell her
you found the company yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you I can play
the good husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the back, there's a number
for consultations.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her to call there...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes on the road!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, this is
Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, this is The Care's main office?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's correct.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're not currently
a member, I assume?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's right. What steps do
I need to take?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready
to write this down?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...documents to prove
your income level,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I.E. the title to your property, etc.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our property title?
Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, peaches!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have some too, Mr. Kevin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it outside
the door next time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And knock!
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No entering during my lesson!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, miss!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Park Da-song!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where are you?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, how could you run out
from your lesson?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you buy all this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no big deal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, don't do that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same!
They smell the same!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica smells like that, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do we all need
to use different soap, now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And fabric softener.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the semi-basement smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In an age like ours,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our entire family got hired!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we put our 4 salaries together?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to Min!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That asshole's dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo's on the rampage!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't overdo it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use this instead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a fucking grip!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a grip!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a deluge!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But they're not rain clouds, over.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you, over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Currently your sister's lip is
pouting like a duck's bill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's super annoyed, over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we have to go,
let's have fun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye, this is no ordinary
camping trip.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you miss
your brother's birthday?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even your busy father is
taking time off to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The outdoor theater?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He loves it when it rains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie and Berry get this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and for Foofoo...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs to run around
to feel happy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's like the canine version
of Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you lying down outside?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't he hot out there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gazing at the sky
from home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, want some water?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's sparkling, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung, some water?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telepathy... thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, all these varieties
of alcohol.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Let me add another
to the mix!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pretty classy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?
It's Da-hye's diary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her diary?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just so we can understand
each other deeper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, are you two dating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious.
She really likes me too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A while back...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, washing
your daughter-in-law's socks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like her.
She's a good kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's pretty,
but she's not wild.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now that we're daydreaming...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Da-hye and I marry,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how your acting got so good!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acting is one thing,
but this family is so gullible, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The madame especially.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's so naive, and nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's rich, but still nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not "rich, but still nice."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Nice because she's rich."
You know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, if I had all this money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be nice too!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even nicer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's true.
Your mom's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rich people are naive.
No resentments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No creases on them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those creases all get smoothed out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ki-woo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The driver before me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Yoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be working somewhere else now,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, he must be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's young, got a nice physique.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must've found a better job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking hell!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with her now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Come on, Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just focus on us, okay?
On us!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome timing, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jessica. Cheers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to put it?
You fit in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This rich house suits you.
Not like us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, before...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like she's lived here for years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which,
if this became our house,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we lived here,
which room would you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We live here now, don't we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting drunk in the living room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we live here.
Why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our home right now.
It's cosy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, but suppose Park walked
through that door now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd run and hide like a cockroach.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids, you know at our house,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting fucking tired of this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A cockroach?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? What's wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fooled you!
Didn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?
Fucking puppy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is it at this hour?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old housekeeper?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she here for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She won't stop ringing it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raising a racket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hello! I'm...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The madame's not in, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I worked here
for a very long time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it,
but why are you here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot something in the basement
under the kitchen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I left, they pushed me out
so quickly...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you let me in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't in the plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for the trouble.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can put your raincoat...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll just be a second.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what did you leave below?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want to come down with me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just go ahead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me push this!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull it! From over there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull it hard!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I scare you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I'm here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is all this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No you're not!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you say that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm really hungry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many days has it been?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must've been so hungry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a nice woman. She let me in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was wedged under the shelf.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't open it
from the inside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would be too in this situation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know my name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to speak to you alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Talking about.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Chung-sook.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me sis!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This tastes great.
What happened to your face?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeding your husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all! I bought all his food
with my salary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so unfair!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how long has
your husband been down here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on a sec.
4 years?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 years, 3 months and 17 days.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, it's June now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 years ago
when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the time before Mr. Park's family
moved in,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought my husband down here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So only I know about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's how it happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now that I know, I've no choice
but to call the police!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No please, sis!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As fellow members of the needy,
please don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not needy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're needy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've no house, no money,
only debts!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used loan sharks?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Taiwan cake shop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was overwhelmed by debt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please take this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not much,
just a modest sum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we'll send it
to you every month.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return,
just once every 2 days,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please leave him some food.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No no, just once a week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait... Jessica?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, my ankle!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?
Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, my foot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you some family of charlatans?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, sis...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad, my foot.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No reception in the basement,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!
It's too late now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady, are you crazy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did those nice people
ever do wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do this to them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop right there!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I'll push the 'send' button.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't push!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go up, honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time for you to get some fresh air!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, this 'send' button is
like a missile launcher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, honey?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after witnessing
the charlatan family video,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was unable to contain
his shock and fury</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at their wicked,
despicable provocation!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've missed your jokes, honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands in the air, fuckers!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Higher!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You scumbag family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Husband?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wife?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Son?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Daughter?
- Daughter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You neanderthals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this home suffused
with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cretins!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know about art?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would they know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it to me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job!
Delete it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, don't send it by accident.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, do you know
how to make ram-don?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ram-don?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, the camping...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My god, what a disaster.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Da-song was crying
and refusing to go home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anyway, ram-don as soon
as we walk in, okay?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you're almost here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8 minutes, according to the GPS.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You arrive in 8 minutes...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Start boiling
the water right away!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is ram-don?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, quickly!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ramen / Udon</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, I can't drag her any further!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome home!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-song!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-song!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you
just eat the ram-don?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wait. I can give it
to my husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's sirloin in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cooked through?
Medium well done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Shut up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, do you want some ram-don?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song doesn't want it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you staring?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Respect!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do this every day?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, I even send whole sentences
to thank him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone of your age should know it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morse Code.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sensor's going batty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ridiculous, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Running around,
trying to please a kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not some kind of prince.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the youngest. It's common.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song is a bit... unwell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was an incident.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What incident?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a birthday party
at home that day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even in bed, he couldn't stop
thinking about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he was all...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever seen
a child have a seizure?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you live
in a place like this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, lots of people
live underground.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially if you count
semi-basements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel comfortable here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels like I was born here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I had my wedding here, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my old age,
love will comfort me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So please.
Let me live down here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's dad says it's just
a part of growing up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say a ghost
in the house brings wealth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, the money's been
good recently.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank god.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay here for now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie, what's wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something under there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom!
- Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How could you?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,
then ate it yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want her to make one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the point!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Ki-jung?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under there! Hurry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, cut it out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Park Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you take after to be so stubborn!
Look at this rain!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>OMG Kevin. Da-song camping
in the yard.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have it.
I can't believe him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Da-hye!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the living room,
do you copy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Copy, over.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got it, over.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that tent going to leak?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should we sleep here?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got a full view of the tent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good idea.
I'll feel much better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's watch over him as we sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a kid...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that smell coming from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What smell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim's smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not sure what you mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
You must have smelled it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That smell that wafts through the car,
how to describe it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like an old radish?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know when you boil a rag?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It smells like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, even though he always seems
about to cross the line,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he never does cross it.
That's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that smell crosses the line.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It powers through right
into the back seat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How bad can it be?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hard to describe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been ages
since I rode a subway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People who ride the subway
have a special smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't this like the car's back seat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if Da-song comes back in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can just pull my hand back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it clockwise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know where.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have those cheap panties?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then buy me drugs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy me drugs!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat this instead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Emergency! Emergency, over!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Emergency!</i>
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, over!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, what's wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I can't sleep, over.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So stop it and come in, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep in your soft bed, over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't want to, over.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Park Da-song.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just sleep...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did it turn out back there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The people in the basement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I tied them up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will we do now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do now,
what's our plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been wondering...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would Min do
in this situation?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min wouldn't be
in this situation!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So nothing happened.
You understand?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got my own plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you two just forget
about it, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go take a bath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing there?
Hurry up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stay there.
This is all sewage water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was our window open?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me out, Ki-taek!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Ki-woo, close the window!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got shocked?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dizzy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on a sec.
Wait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I'm dizzy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung, be careful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I've got a concussion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, that woman Chung-sook...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a nice person.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She kicked me down the stairs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat after me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ki-woo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Help... M...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was your plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before, you said you had a plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will you do?
About...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the basement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No plan at all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No plan.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But look now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's sleeping on the floor,
us included.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why people shouldn't make plans.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if something spins out of control,
it doesn't matter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of it fucking matters.
Got it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you hugging that stone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps clinging to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you need some sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps following me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Jessica! Sorry to call
on Sunday morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you free for lunch today?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're having a birthday impromptu
for Da-song.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A birthday party?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Please come by 1 pm,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll count today
as one of your lessons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?
See you soon!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom.
- Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pay him overtime.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone sit down,
I'll explain!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-hye: We're having a party,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and mom said to invite you!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sis, in the basement...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have 10 outdoor tables.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First take them all out,
then arrange them...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, come to the window.
I need to show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With Da-song's tent
in the middle,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">curve the tables outward...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A crane's wing formation!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the tent
as the Japanese warship.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our tables will make
a semicircular crane's wing formation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then near the tent will be
the barbeque grill, firewood and such.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arrange them all there!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh sure, bring your husband too!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents,
just come!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What dress code?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know my culinary skills!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! We'll get drunk
in the daytime.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet, he's sleeping!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to all the rain yesterday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we traded camping
for a garden party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lemons into lemonade.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, that rain was such
a blessing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents,
I mean it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, just squeeze
your Mini Cooper into the garage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here!
It's been so long!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you no presents!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were thinking of something else.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While kissing me,
you thought of something else.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone looks gorgeous, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look so natural.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I fit in here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this setting, do I fit in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are you going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to go down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to go down there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to those people, down lower.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, what is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so embarrassing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the concept is simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'll be a parade with Jessica
carrying a birthday cake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we jump out and attack Jessica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swinging our tomahawks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally he'll save Jessica the cake princess,
and they'll all cheer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess your wife likes events
and surprises.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, she does.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's particularly
into this party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying your best, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you love her, after all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting paid extra.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of this as part of your work,
okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you go down below?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reach an understanding?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all got too fucking worked up
last night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad was going on about some plan...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this down to them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They must be hungry.
- Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let them eat first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come next time for sure!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you are, Jessica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a special favor to ask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is... how to describe it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's trauma recovery cake?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, mister!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin? Kevin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, happy birthday!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stop!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out here, Chung-sook!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the blood! Push down
on the wound!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go, don't!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The emergency room!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the car!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't wait for an ambulance!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop pushing, Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes it hurt more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Car keys!
The car keys!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw them!
Throw me the keys!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Mr. Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Opening my eyes for the first time
in a month,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I saw a detective.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the right to
an attorney...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who looked nothing like
a detective.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he laughing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a sec.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They keep laughing.
For no reason.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then do I have to do it again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Miranda thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the right to remain silent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything you say can and
will be used against you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He keeps laughing, look!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even when I heard
how much Ki-jung bled that day...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and we were lucky
to get away with a probation...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Kim Ki-jung, RIP</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I kept laughing.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Still, when I went back
and watched the news reports,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't laugh.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper-class home</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a highly unusual case.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disappeared into the neighboring alleys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they have yet
to find any witnesses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Given the situation,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not an exaggeration to say that
Kim vanished into thin air.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Actually Mom and I had no idea
where Dad was.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Eventually the news went quiet,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and after the tails stopped,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I started going up that mountain.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>From up there,
you get a great view of the house.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That day, despite the cold,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I felt like staying longer.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dash-dash-dot-dot</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Son!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You were a Boy Scout,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>so I'm writing this just
in case.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Have your injuries healed?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm doing fine in here.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Though thinking of
Ki-jung makes me cry.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even now, what happened that day
doesn't seem real.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It feels like a dream,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and yet it doesn't.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where I needed to go...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A house where such
a grisly crime took place</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>would surely not be easy
to sell.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mr. Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Still, thanks to the house
being empty,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But those real estate
sharks sure are clever.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and managed to sell the house.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the family is usually out.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It turns out Germans eat
more than just sausage and beer.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What a relief.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Today at least I was able
to write you a letter.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So long.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're home, Ki-woo?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A fundamental plan.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm going to earn money.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A lot of it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but first I'll earn money.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, we don't show this house
to just anyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Because the sunshine is
so nice there.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All you'll need to do</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>is walk up the stairs.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Take care until then.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So long.</i></font>
