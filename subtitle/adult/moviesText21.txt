<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Have you not heard?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and His understanding no one can fathom.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He gives strength to the weary

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even youths grow tired and weary,

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They will run and not grow weary.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They will walk and not be faint.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond, hang on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Desmond!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you out of here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond. Desmond!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait up.
- Catch up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait up, I've got something to tell you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, Hal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Race you to the top.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Cheater!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Want a hand?
- I got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quit it.
- You quit it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Pete's sake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Get away from that
ledge, you damn fool kids!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to break your necks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Putting in a sidewalk...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You boys wouldn't recognize it now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I died with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like we boys never existed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's all I got for you today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Block him with your right, Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Do you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom! Ugh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why stop 'em?
Saves me whipping them both.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, I just whip the one that wins.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell have you done?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can't hear me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get some ice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You shift that basket.
- I got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he breathing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal? Hal, can you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal, can you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal... Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dilated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doin'?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me, Desmond?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that gonna teach the boy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's violent enough already.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, fine,
you go smother him in kisses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal's gonna be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murder, it's the worst sin of all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to take another man's life,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing hurts his heart so much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you understand English?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to tell you again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mind
your own damned business!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep it off, Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why does he hate us so much?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he don't hate us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hates himself sometimes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Praise the Lord</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Praise the Lord</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Let the people rejoice!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Oh, come</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> To the Father
Through Jesus the Son</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> And give him the glory</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Great things he has done </i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd we sound, Desmond?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on out there? Desmond!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it up, get it up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drag him out. Just the tarp.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll phone an ambulance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no time. Joshua's pickup.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quick!
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in good hands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a severed artery.
Get some sutures.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, doctor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might have saved this boy's life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name, son?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gilbert.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel pain?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with us, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you need?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My belt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pants don't hold up
so good without it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh, I don't have your belt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I know that, ma'am.
It's out there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right out there
with the boy still.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm just here to take blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll call you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever given blood before, Mr...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may be a little dizzy
when we're done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is somebody picking you up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, ma'am. Walking back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you live?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fort Hill, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a ways.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just 5 or 6 miles,
but I cut through the woods.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 7 that way!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must really like the woods.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. I sure do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, put some pressure here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodness. Does she know that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not yet. She's about to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spoke to her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hal!
- Come here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your greasy paws off of me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish me luck, Momma.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. I have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the belt man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond, yes, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood 2 days in a row.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you got to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since you stuck me
with that needle,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my heart's been beating real fast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No good?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arteries spurt blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And veins?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bleed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you need to practice</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I probably do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On dating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another medical question perhaps?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because I'm sitting in the dark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're just beautiful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the way!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to watch where you're going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't ask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch where you're walking!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you say nothing to us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loads of boys
from our church are going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a movie star, our boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice uniform, good hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just hope that
when our Hal gets shot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's through the front of his jacket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a simple entry wound,
not much mess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Artie got hit in the back,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrecked his uniform entirely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was lucky he was dead,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get outta of my sight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, part mountain goat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or are you just going
to leave me stranded?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A kiss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that is still my condition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hold on now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't gonna slap me, are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kiss me and find out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to enlist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to be a medic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I wouldn't know,
you haven't asked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon as you get your first leave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still don't like you
at this moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well, I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma said come see you here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These 3 were my best friends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grew up with 'em,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I enlisted with 'em.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now my friends are there,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy, I signed up already.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't everybody else!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the damn idiot fools we were.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, there you go, thinking it all out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you won't be giving no thanks to God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Ready.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all need some air.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, please, step away from the bus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to have this.
It's mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep it right here, where I'll be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't say that about my girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What else...
- Hey. Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Sorry, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...means you're the person.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall Fuller.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because
no one else here can read.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know testicles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- How you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Desmond.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pipe down, Grease, all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, the old good book, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Lucky's got a good book.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attention!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Line up! Move it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, move it. Move it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a very
strange-looking individual</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't mind me
saying so, Private.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name?
- Andy Walker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you been dead, son?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something off
in your presentation, Private.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't place it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it your hair?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, of course, that's it.
The knife.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who threw the knife?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm Polish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see your Indian war cry, son.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louder! Let me see it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a sign of great respect
to your people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Sergeant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me want to pull
an ear off, Private.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should be easy for you, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Corporal.
- Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your foot. Higher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone outside. Now! Move it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said move it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now move your privates, Private Parts!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I may then kick them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Create a loop.
This is the rabbit hole.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good, Tex.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep struggling, Teach.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know if you don't breathe,
you'll die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You strangled yourself, numb nuts!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me something!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run like you mean it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move! Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see you work. Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig, dig, dig!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hustle! Hustle!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your asses across that line!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time! Nice work, Doss!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a personal gift
from the United States government</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to each and every one of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber .30, M1,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't point your gun forward.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not want to be shot today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how much you are tempted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the weapon by your side.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay attention.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Problem, Private Corn Stalk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't touch a gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is the problem?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No problem, just a mistake, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told the Army when I joined up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not possible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a C.O., sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or saluting the flag and doing my duty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't want to work
on Saturdays, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Now we got that clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let me tell you my requirements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as you're in this company,
under my command,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will obey my orders. Period.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismissed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He does not practice violence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will not even deign
to touch a weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is what we men fight for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I will expect everyone
in this company</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the short time he will be with us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I clear?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sergeant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'cha got there, Dessie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what that is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just seems kind of small.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's half the Bible for half the man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember speaking to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if you was attacked?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, take a poke.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit me, Doss. Go on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chickenshit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on here. What is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, pass it around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Please give it back, Smitty."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please give it back, Smitty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear voices, Desmond?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'm not a crazy person.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm different. I know that, but...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lonely?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the one we're pretending
to have right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm trying to
understand, all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God says not to kill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one of His
most important Commandments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">War is a completely different
set of circumstances.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Satan himself we're fighting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sorry,
I will not bear arms.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His religious views
are certainly unique,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you restrict him
to barracks and KP.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want him gone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you men fail to recognize</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will all be on KP!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your heads right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dogs don't know what tired is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to keep going till I drop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, knock it off.
Trying to sleep here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell are you still here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you were.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't good for anybody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure ain't what I joined up for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about what you joined up for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about the lives
of every man in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yours, son.
It's time to quit this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no shame in this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said I was attacked, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what the hell
are you saying, Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bruised half your body sleeping?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I sleep pretty hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a shot right now, Smitty?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At ease.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put in for this furlough
3 weeks ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting married this afternoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says you're not rifle qualified.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Stelzer's determination was...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand Private Doss your firearm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a direct order
from a company commander.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's been long enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so very sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes men just get cold feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some men might. Not my Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who cares only about regulations
and not his men.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe in this book
as much as any man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't got answers
to questions that big,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I also feel like
my values are under attack,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what are you gonna do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit him with your Bible?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm prepared to give my life for my men.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't win wars
by giving up your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I can't convince you, maybe she can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They wouldn't let me call you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it wasn't your making.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have they done to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, I'm all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leavenworth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be some other way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what that could be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tried.
Nobody can say you didn't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who are you going to save in prison?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably nobody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I been prideful?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I am prideful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I don't stay true
to what I believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much less how you could live with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you didn't try to be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will love you no matter what.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They want him to plead guilty,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and I don't see how
he can live with that.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you, Dorothy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get to talk to him,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're praying for both of you.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will. Bye-bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You leave this room.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Tom! Put it down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got that, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I help you, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, if you would kindly tell him</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a very important meeting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, ma'am, it's most vital.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a man out there, Tom Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be over in a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a hearing into
the matter of Private Desmond Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from his commanding officer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How says the defendant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wish to proceed to a court-martial?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Ah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like it's some kind of badge of honor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from his commanding officer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they still deliberating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now you go take this in there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.
It's strictly military personnel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do you, Private?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to serve in a combat unit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that ain't right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I would just be
sitting at home safe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to serve.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to want to put a little bit
of it back together.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, sir,
but nobody's allowed...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on out there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I need to show you this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that truly the way it works, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then you're done with?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were at Lys?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twice decorated, I see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take it you are the Private's father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am, sir. Thomas Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are framed in our constitution.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I believe in them, as he does.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are why I went
and fought to protect them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if it wasn't for that,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Corporal Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have the letter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are protected by an Act of Congress</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without a single weapon
to protect yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you get home,
you tell him I love him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better come home to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Uncle Sam is mild</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> He's peaceful as a child</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> But never get him
riled or you'll be whipped </i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood, shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, pipe down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killjoy was here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear! Clear! Move aside!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 96th... or what's left of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the guys we're replacing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Seems good to me.
- Clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- As gold.
- Clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All clear, Sarge!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Glover.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Manville, 96th.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been assigned to you, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Irv Schecter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just come off the line?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, What's it like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hacksaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We climbed up 6 times.
6 times, they threw us off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're animals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stinking animals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nips don't care if they live or die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want to die.
They keep coming at you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they ain't never going to give up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Hey, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Japs
deliberately target the wounded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lose all your Red Cross markings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nips put a premium on shooting medics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The white is a bull's-eye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, I got you a new helmet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One size fits all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get Okinawa, we take Japan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody can survive that shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but they can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, there's 3...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all different up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All clear, Captain.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gents, move out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep climbing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through, make way.
Out of the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brown.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give this to Jessop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Corporal!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me, Jack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep moving forward! Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vito!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hurt?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I got you, Ralph.
Just breathe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, I got you.
I got you. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not going to last a day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got kids!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you shifted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stretcher! Stretcher!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing wrong with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Hang on, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move. Go, go, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's a priority.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got him, we got him. Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him down. All right? Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic! Help! Help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, Frank. Where you hit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a hand here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there! The bunkers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see them. Better stay down, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him, Doss. I got him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You doing okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, fire!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take 'em. Go. Fire!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go, Smitty,
we'll cover you. Leapfrog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Satchel!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ghoul!
- Clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover! Cover!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover his ass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic! Medic! Help me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul. Ghoul.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay. Where you hit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a bump on the head, that's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Andy.
- Andy what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Andy Walker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also known as?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, men. Good work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig in for the night.
We hold this spot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we mop up the rest
of the ridge tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rotate watch every 2 hours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And shoot anything
that don't speak English.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it ain't safe to go out there alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here, now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are you going, Doss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still more wounded out there, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go with him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be smart. Keep your ears down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's find a spot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page and Unger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralston.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It don't help none.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you got that right. Not here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, give me that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This man is going to need some plasma.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it.
- Leave him with us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You're okay now. They got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we find a hole and dig in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds good to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your helmet on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't going to eat them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't eat meat. Help yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one heck of a dame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell her that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, until she got to know you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an asshole sometimes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, all right. All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These Japs are sneaky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell of a dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rifle's just there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't bite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After what we've just been through,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never claimed to be sane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daddy's a drunk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Made him mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Least you knew him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, your momma raised you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never saw her again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned how to hate quick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then whip us just because it set.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could take that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but when he would
do it to our momma...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from me, woman!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull the damn trigger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't kill him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my heart, I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's why I made my promise to God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't never going to
touch a gun again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move! Get your asses over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back, fall back! Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're coming from underground.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target is
Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't expect to
be here much longer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I called an artillery strike.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back. Move. Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back! Incoming!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here, kid!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, son.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what to do.
Keep pressure on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta move right now.
Come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go! Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's too many,
get the hell out of here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's move. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off the ridge!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it you want of me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hear you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic, help me! Help me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me, Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in good hands.
Easy does it. Easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...6... 8...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">14.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get these men secured immediately.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Private Ford, how many?
- 32 only came down, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good Lord.
- Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry. It's Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help. Help me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out. I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, fellas, easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of 3. 1, 2, 3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help, medic over here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, buddy, hold it together.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at the edge, Eric.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just sit tight, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay, Eric.
You're okay, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a gun, this is going to work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One for each leg, Eric.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you now, Eric.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Japs!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you. I got you. I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, another one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down, Jack.
I'll get you a drink.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just lost our cover.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're stirrin',
we got to move. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time.
They just keep coming by the...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss. Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help. Help me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, buddy. Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll end up killing the rest of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give me the reinforcements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three battalions got wiped out today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need them faster than that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
It's all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morphine. It's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Doss. Be quiet.
Be quiet. I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be quiet. Just be quiet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go. Try now. Try now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was blind!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to get out of here, okay?
Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Okay, we got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Lord, help me get one more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me get one more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, help me get one more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more. Help me get one more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more. Help me get one more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell
are these guys coming from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Hacksaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even lowered a couple of Japs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, easy. All set, move out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in here.
There's Nips everywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.
Private Corn Stalk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are nothing
if not full of surprises.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some morphine?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. There you go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let me see. Let me see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's this doing?
Okay, not bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks much worse than it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girls will still want to kiss you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sarge, you okay here for a while?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, fine. Get out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready? Let's go.
You and me, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain.
There's something you gotta see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, follow me.
He's right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Cap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get down, son?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss. Howell's still up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, Howell and Doss did this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly just Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Doss, the coward.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm going to drag you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arms up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Uh-huh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good. That's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, we got him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, easy. Here, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you wounded?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make some space.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need someone
to come and clean up in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Irv?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done more than
any other man could have done</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the service of his country.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope one day you can forgive me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go back up tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they believe so much
in how much you believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they want a piece of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're not going
to go up there without you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go to work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down. Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the ground.
On the ground. Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lay down, lay down.
I got the morphine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's get
these men out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold up, hold up! Desmond!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was praying the whole time.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I would say anyone is wrong</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even though I said those things to him</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But then, in the long run,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then to have him
end up saving my life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was the irony of the whole thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, he just lit up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "I thought I was blind."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.</font>
