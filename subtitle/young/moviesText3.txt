I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.
What a lame-o.
Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.
<i>You want me to kill him for you?</i>
Yeah. Would you?
<i>My name is Lester Burnham.</i>
<i>This is my neighborhood.</i>
<i>This is my street.</i>
<i>This is my life.</i>
<i>I'm 42 years old.</i>
<i>In less than a year, I'll be dead.</i>
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I don't know that yet.</i>
<i>And in a way,</i>
<i>I'm dead already.</i>
<i>Look at me:</i>
<i>jerking off in the shower.</i>
<i>This will be the high point of my day.</i>
<i>It's all downhill from here.</i>
<i>That's my wife, Carolyn.</i>
<i>See the way the handle on those pruning</i>
<i>shears matches her gardening clogs?</i>
<i>That's not an accident.</i>
<i>Hush, Bitsy!</i>
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- <i>That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.</i>
<i>And that's his lover, Jim.</i>
- You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?
- <i>Come on. Yes. Inside.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Jim!</i>
Good morning, Carolyn.
I love your tie!
That color!
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.
- I've never heard that.
- <i>Man, I get exhausted just watching her.</i>
<i>She wasn't always like this.</i>
<i>She used to be happy.</i>
We <i>used to be happy.</i>
<i>My daughter Jane.</i>
<i>Only child.</i>
<i>Janie's a pretty typical teenager:</i>
<i>angry, insecure, confused.</i>
<i>I wish I could tell her that's all going</i>
<i>to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.</i>
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?
- Yes.
- Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.
Lester, could you make me a little later,
please, because I'm not quite late enough.
Nice going, Dad.
<i>Both my wife and</i>
<i>daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.</i>
<i>And they're right.</i>
<i>I have lost something.</i>
<i>I'm not exactly sure</i>
<i>what it is,</i>
<i>but I know</i>
<i>I didn't always feel this...</i>
<i>sedated.</i>
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>It's never too late</i>
<i>to get it back.</i>
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from <i>Media Monthly</i> magazine.
I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.
Well, we're all under a deadline here.
You see, there's some basic information...
about your product launch that isn't even
covered in your press release, and I'd...
Yeah, c...
can I ask you a question?
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?
For you, Brad,
I got five!
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.
- <i>Right?</i>
- Exactly.
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the
company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,</i>
and she used the card numbers and stayed at
the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000. That's somebody's salary.
That's somebody who's going to get fired
because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
<i>Jesus!</i>
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.
<i>That's why we're having everyone...</i>
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.
That way management
can assess who's valuable...
And who's expendable.
<i>It's just business.</i>
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.
- You've been here how long? A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.
I'm trying to level with you.
This is your one chance
to save your job.
<i>There is no decision.</i>
<i>You just write the damn thing.</i>
- You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.
Let's just all sell our souls and work for
Satan 'cause it's more convenient that way.
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?
So, we finally
got new neighbors.
<i>You know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of the Real Estate King,</i>
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.
<i>Their</i> sycamore?
Come on.
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.
You know that.
How can you call it <i>their</i> sycamore?
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something
if it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?
No. No, we don't.
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,
you can listen
to whatever you like.
So, Janie, how was school?
It was okay.
Just okay?
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?
They've hired
this efficiency expert,
this really friendly guy
named Brad...
How perfect is that? And he's basically
there to make it seem they're justified...
in firing somebody, because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...
You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?
What do you expect?
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.
Oh, what?
You're "Mother of the Year"?
You treat her like an employee.
- What?
What?
I'm going
to get some ice cream.
Janie...
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.
I'm just... I...
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault?
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
Welcome.
I'm Carolyn Burnham.
This living room
is very dramatic.
<i>Wait till you see</i>
<i>the native stone fireplace!</i>
A simple cream could really lighten things
up. You could even put in a skylight.
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen?
It's a dream come true
for any cook.
Just filled
with positive energy, huh?
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.
<i>You know, you could have some fun</i>
<i>backyard get-togethers out here.</i>
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?
If you have a problem with the plants, I
can always call my landscape architect.
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, tropical.
This is a cement hole.
Uh...
I have some tiki torches
in the garage.
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak... You baby!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Who are you looking for?
My parents are coming tonight.
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.
Gross. I hate it
when my mom does that.
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask us to come?
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.
But she's been practicing
for weeks.
I'll bet she's going to resent it, and I'm
missing the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.
Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a
real distance growing between you and Jane.
"Growing"?
She hates me.
- She's just willful.
- She hates you too.
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
Hi! Patty!
<i>Now, for your halftime entertainment,</i>
<i>Rockwell High's award-winning</i>
<i>Dancing Spartanettes!</i>
We can leave
right after this, right?
Shit. They're still here.
Janie!
Hey, I really enjoyed that.
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- <i>I didn't win anything.</i>
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.
This is my friend,
Angela Hayes.
Okay. Good to meet you.
<i>You were also good tonight,</i>
<i>very... precise.</i>
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.
Honey...
I am so proud of you.
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.
Okay, uh, we have to go.
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride.
- I have a car. You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.
You <i>have</i> a car.
That's great. That's great.
Janie's thinking about
getting a car, too, soon, aren't you?
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Angela.
<i>Any friend of Janie's...</i>
<i>is a... friend of mine.</i>
Well... I'll be
seeing you around, then.
Could he be any more...
pathetic?
I think he's sweet.
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.
<i>It's the weirdest thing.</i>
<i>I feel like I've been in a coma</i>
<i>for about 20 years...</i>
<i>and I'm just now waking up.</i>
<i>Spec-tacular.</i>
I'm so sorry
my dad was weird tonight.
That's okay.
I'm used to guys
drooling over me.
It started
when I was about 12.
I'd go to dinner
with my parents.
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.
And I knew
what they were thinking,
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.
I still like it. If people I don't even
know look at me and want to fuck me,
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.
Which is great,
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.
I really think
it'll happen for you.
I know.
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.
Asshole.
Hello? Hello?
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?
I didn't.
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.
- And I star-69'ed, and I called you
back. - Well, I was in the shower.
Oh, gross!
<i>Ricky! Breakfast!</i>
Be right there.
- Mom.
- Hello.
I don't eat bacon, remember?
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.
What's new in the world, Dad?
This country
is going straight to hell.
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
No.
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- It's just a little something from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.
You just... You drop it
in the water, and it's done.
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?
- We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're
partners, so what's your business?
Well... he is a tax attorney.
And he's an anesthesiologist.
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?
How can they
be so shameless?
That's the whole thing, Dad.
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.
Well, it is.
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly,
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.
<i>I'm serious. He just</i>
<i>pulled down his pants and yanked it out.</i>
- <i>You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."</i>
- Gross!
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?
<i>Of course. He's a really</i>
<i>well-known photographer.</i>
He shoots for <i>Elle</i> on,
like, a regular basis.
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.
Hey, that's how
things really are.
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.
<i>So are you. You've only been</i>
<i>in</i> Seventeen <i>once, and you looked fat.</i>
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!
Cunt!
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.
- <i>Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.</i>
- Him?
<i>Jane. No way.</i>
<i>He's a total lunatic.</i>
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.
And then Connie Cardullo told me that his
parents had to put him in a mental institution.
Why? What did he do?
What do you mean?
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.
- You want to have, like, 10,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.
<i>Hi. My name's Ricky.</i>
<i>I just moved next door to you.</i>
I know.
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
- <i>Thanks.</i>
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.
What a freak.
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?
He's, like, so confident.
<i>That can't be real.</i>
I don't believe him.
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.
- <i>How'd you get in the Army?</i>
- <i>Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.</i>
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.
Hey.
- What's going on here?
- Bend all the way down. Here comes the Bull of the Woods.
I'm sorry. What?
Mom, nobody said anything.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.
- How would it look if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.
As you know, my business
is selling an image,
and part of my job
is to live that image.
Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you
want to say and spare me the propaganda.
All right.
Hi, Shirley!
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.
- I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!
- <i>Buddy! Buddy! Hi!</i>
- Hi.
Good to see you again.
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.
Oh, we've met before, actually. This
thing last year. Christmas at the Sheraton.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.
Honey, don't be weird.
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.
Well, oka...
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.
Ohh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.
<i>Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood</i>
<i>Trail? The house with the red door?</i>
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved in the house next to you.
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.
Hi, Lester Burnham.
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?
Do you get high?
You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but...
I'm in complete awe of you.
I mean, your firm...
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,
and your personal
sales record is...
It's very intimidating.
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,
if you'd ever be willing.
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...
that I'm even
in the same league as you.
I don't.
I'd love to.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.
I'll do that.
Thank you.
Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?
<i>Re-Animator.</i>
Look.
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.
Fine. So don't pay me.
Excuse me?
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.
Asshole.
I think you just
became my personal hero.
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...
Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.
I have other sources of income.
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.
Lester?
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.
This is Ricky Fitts.
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.
I go to school
with your daughter.
- With Jane?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Jane.
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.
Oh, I'm in trouble.
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.
Anytime. Lester?
If you want any more,
you know where I live.
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.
I should say hi
to your dad.
I don't want to be rude.
Nice suit.
You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.
Ooh, is that root beer?
I love root beer,
don't you?
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?
Yes, of course.
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay?
- <i>Sorry about my dad.</i>
- <i>Don't be. I think it's funny.</i>
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- <i>Shut up.</i>
<i>He is. If he just</i>
<i>worked out a little, he'd be hot.</i>
- Shut up!
- Come on.
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in
his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.
<i>You are so grossing me out right now.</i>
<i>If he built up his chest</i>
<i>and arms, I would totally fuck him.</i>
I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.
Jane, shh. What was that noise?
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.
No, I'm serious.
See?
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- <i>What is it?</i>
<i>It's that psycho next door.</i>
Jane, what if he worships you?
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you
surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?
Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.
Really?
Welcome to
<i>America's Weirdest Home Videos.</i>
<i>Ricky?</i>
Coming, Dad.
<i>You know I don't like</i>
<i>locked doors in my house, boy.</i>
- I'm sorry. I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.
So what's up?
I... I need a urine sample.
Wow.
It's been six months already.
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.
Yeah. I suppose.
Y-You know...
Well, good night, son.
I've been waiting for you.
You've been working out,
haven't you?
I can tell.
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.
I'm very, very dirty.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- You were masturbating.
- I was not.
Yes, you were.
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.
That's disgusting.
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.
- So do I.
- Really?
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.
Lester, I refuse to live like this!
This is not a marriage.
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.
Well, guess what.
I've changed.
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.
I'm not? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.
Don't you mess
with me, mister.
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.
On what grounds?
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!
<i>But... I did support you</i>
<i>when you got your license.</i>
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.
Oh!
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?
<i>It's a great thing</i>
<i>when you realize you still have...</i>
<i>the ability</i>
<i>to surprise yourself.</i>
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do</i>
<i>that you've forgotten about.</i>
Hey, guys.
Lester. I didn't know you ran.
- I just started.
- Good for you.
I figured you guys might be able to give
me some pointers. I need to shape up, fast.
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...
increased strength
and flexibility as well?
I... I want
to look good naked.
<i>Oh, what is this?</i>
<i>Fuckin' gay pride parade?</i>
Hey! Yo, Ricky.
My entire life is passing before my eyes,
and those two have barely broken a sweat.
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.
Oh, whoa. Well.
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
Ricky, uh...
I was thinking about the, uh...
I was gonna... The movie we talked about.
- <i>Re-Animator.</i>
- Yeah!
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.
I don't think my dad would try to come in
while someone else is here, but you never know.
- What is this?
- Urine.
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.
It's not mine.
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.
You like Pink Floyd?
I like a lot of music.
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.
How much do you want?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.
Wow!
This shit is
top of the line.
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.
Is that what we smoked
last night?
This is all I ever smoke.
- How much?
- Two grand.
Jesus!
Things have changed since 1973.
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>
And I only accept cash.
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an eight-track.
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.
All I did was party
and get laid.
I had my whole life
ahead of me.
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.
Never underestimate
the power of denial.
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
Uh-oh. Mom's mad.
Bench presses.
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.
I see you're smoking pot now.
I... I'm so glad.
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.
Uh... Lester!
You have such hostility in you.
Do you mind? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.
Lester, you will not
get away with this.
You can be sure of that.
That's... what...
you... think.
"My job consists of
basically masking...
"my contempt for
the assholes in charge...
"and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...
"so I can jerk off...
"while I fantasize
about a life...
that doesn't so closely
resemble hell."
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...
buying pussy
with company money?
<i>Which I think</i>
<i>would interest the I.R.S.,</i>
since it technically
constitutes fraud.
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.
- What do you want?
- One year's salary <i>with</i> benefits.
That's not going to happen.
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?
Against who?
Against you.
<i>Can you prove that you</i>
<i>didn't offer to save my job...</i>
if I let you blow me?
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...
with nothing to lose.
Yeah.
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.
Christy left for New York
this morning.
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.
Yes, we are splitting up.
Buddy. I'm so sorry.
Yes. According to her, I'm...
too focused on my career.
As if being driven to succeed is...
some sort of a character flaw.
Well, she certainly did take advantage
of the lifestyle my success afforded her.
Ooh! Ha. Wow.
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
Well, call me crazy,
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,
one <i>must</i> project
an image of success...
<i>at all times.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>I was filming this dead bird.</i>
- Why?
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>
I want you to stop filming me.
Okay.
Well, whatever. This is boring.
Let's go.
- Do you need a ride?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.
It's okay. I'll walk.
But thanks.
He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.
- <i>Come on, Jane.</i>
- I think I'm going to walk too.
<i>What?</i>
Jane, that's, like,
almost a mile.
<i>Oh, God!</i>
I love it! Oh! Oh!
- You like getting nailed by the King?
- Oh, yes, I love it!
- Fuck me, Your Majesty! Aah!
- Ohh!
- Who's the King?
- Oh! You are!
<i>Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.</i>
What?
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg
fajita for $1.29 for a limited time only?
Uh, no, but thank you.
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be 4.98, please.
- Would you like some Smiley sauce?
- <i>No, no...</i>
<i>Actually, I'd like</i>
<i>to fill out an application.</i>
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.
- Good.
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.
I don't think
you'd fit in here.
I have fast food experience.
Yeah, like 20 years ago.
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.
- That was exactly what I needed...
- Mm.
the "royal treatment,"
so to speak.
I was so stressed out. Ah!
- Ah! Ah.
- Mm.
Know what I do
when I feel like that?
What?
- I fire a gun.
- Really?
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,
and I... just pop off
a few rounds.
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.
Well...
almost nothing.
- So, do you like your new house?
- I like it.
The people who used to live there fed these
stray cats, so they were always around,
and it drove
my mother nuts.
And then she cut down
their tree.
Is that a funeral?
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died?
No. Have you?
No.
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...
just laying there
on the sidewalk.
She looked really sad.
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.
Why would you film that?
- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it?
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,
just for a second,
and if you're careful,
you can look right back.
And what do you see?
Beauty.
Mom, I want you
to meet somebody.
- Mom.
- Yes?
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Oh, my.
I apologize for the way
things look around here.
<i>This is where my dad hides out.</i>
<i>I take it he's got a thing for guns.</i>
You gotta see
this one thing.
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.
Did you steal his keys?
No. One of my clients
is a locksmith.
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.
Turn it over.
Oh, my God.
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.
There's a whole subculture
of people who collect this Nazi shit.
But my dad just has
this one thing.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
No, you're scared of me.
No, I'm not.
<i>You want to see the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I've ever filmed?</i>
It was one of those days...
where it's a minute
away from snowing,
and there was this electricity
in the air.
You can almost hear it.
Right?
And this bag was just...
dancing with me,
like a little kid
begging me to play with it,
for 15 minutes.
That's the day I realized
that there was this...
entire life behind things...
<i>and this incredibly</i>
<i>benevolent force...</i>
<i>that wanted me to know that there</i>
<i>was no reason to be afraid...</i>
<i>ever.</i>
<i>Video's a poor excuse, I know,</i>
<i>but it helps me remember.</i>
<i>I need to remember.</i>
Sometimes there's so much...
beauty...
in the world.
I feel like
I can't take it...
and my heart...
is just going to...
cave in.
Oh, my God.
What time is it?
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, that's quite all right, dear.
Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.
Why don't you tell
our daughter about it, honey?
Janie, today I quit my job.
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and
then I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.
- Pass the asparagus.
- <i>Your father seems to think...</i>
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.
And your mother seems to prefer that I
go through life like a fucking prisoner...
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...
on the same day
that you lose your job!
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go?"
I quit!
Pass the asparagus.
<i>Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for</i>
<i>putting me under the added pressure...</i>
of being the sole
breadwinner now.
- I already have a job.
- <i>No, no!</i>
<i>Don't give a second thought</i>
<i>as to who's going to pay the mortgage.</i>
We'll leave it up to Carolyn. "You're going
to take care of everything now, Carolyn?"
"Yes. I don't mind."
<i>"Everything? You don't mind having</i>
<i>the sole responsibility?</i>
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't..."
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus?
- I'm not going to be a part of this.
- Sit down!
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.
You two do whatever you want to do whenever
you want to do it, and I don't complain.
- All I want...
- Oh, you don't complain? Oh, please! Excuse me!
I must be psychotic then!
If you don't complain, what is this?
<i>Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter</i>
<i>and see how loud it gets on that one.</i>
Don't interrupt me, honey.
And another thing.
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,
because, frankly...
and I don't think I'm alone here...
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.
- Go away.
- <i>Please.</i>
<i>Please let me in.</i>
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,
but in a way, I'm glad.
Why? So I could see
what freaks you and Dad really are?
Me?
Tsk. God.
Oh, Christ. Mom.
No, I'm glad because, uh...
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:
You cannot count
on anyone except yourself.
You cannot count on
anyone except yourself.
You know, it's sad but true,
and the sooner you learn it,
the better.
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here.
You ungrateful little brat!
Just look at everything
you have!
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!
We didn't even have
our own house.
You little bastard!
<i>Dad, no, I just...</i>
How did you get in there?
How? How?
Come on! Get up!
Come on!
Get up!
<i>Fight back,</i>
<i>you little pussy!</i>
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How?
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.
What were you looking for, huh?
Money? Are you on dope again?
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.
A girlfriend?
Yes, sir. She lives next door.
<i>Her name's Jane.</i>
This is for
your own good, boy.
You have no respect for other
people's things and for authority...
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.
You can't.
There are rules in life.
Yes, sir.
You need structure, yeah.
You need...
- Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.
Don't give up on me, Dad.
Oh, Ricky.
You stay out of there.
- Whoo!
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.
Well, all I know is
I love shooting this gun.
What?
Uh, whose car is that
out front?
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.
- I rule!
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry?
I traded it in.
- Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
- Hm, let me think.
No. You never drove it.
Have you done something different?
You look great.
Where's Jane?
Jane not home.
We have...
the whole house...
to ourselves.
Christ, Carolyn.
When did you become so...
joyless?
Joyless?
I am not joyless.
There happens to be
a lot about me...
that you don't know,
Mr. Smarty Man.
There's plenty of joy
in my life.
Whatever happened to that girl...
who used to fake seizures
at frat parties when she got bored?
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...
to flash
the traffic helicopters?
Have you totally forgotten about her?
Because I haven't.
Lester, you're going
to spill beer on the couch.
So what?
It's just a couch.
This is a $4,000 sofa,
upholstered in Italian silk.
This is not just a couch.
It's just... a... couch!
This isn't life!
This is just stuff,
and it's become more important
to you than living.
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.
I'm only trying to help you!
Don't.
<i>Why?</i>
It's weird watching myself.
I don't like how I look.
<i>I can't believe you don't know</i>
<i>how beautiful you are.</i>
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.
Ha! How does it feel now?
Fine.
You don't feel naked?
I <i>am</i> naked.
You know what I mean.
So tell me about
being in the hospital.
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right?
Of course,
I got kicked out.
Dad and I had
this huge fight.
<i>He hit me.</i>
<i>And the next day at school,</i>
<i>some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>
and I just snapped.
I wanted to kill him.
I would've... killed him...
if they hadn't pulled me off.
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>You must really hate him.</i>
No.
He's not a bad man.
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.
<i>Wait.</i>
I already do hate my dad.
Why?
He's a total asshole;
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,
and it's disgusting.
You'd rather he had the crush on you.
Gross. No.
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.
How?
<i>Well, now I, too,</i>
<i>need structure,</i>
a little fucking discipline.
I'm serious, though.
How could he not
be damaging me?
I need a father
who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.
What a lame-o.
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.
Want me to kill him for you?
Yeah. Would you?
It'll cost you.
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.
I've got almost $3,000.
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.
<i>But...</i>
<i>You know, that's not</i>
<i>a very nice thing to do...</i>
<i>hiring someone</i>
<i>to kill your dad.</i>
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I?
You know I'm not serious, right?
Of course.
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?
<i>Remember those posters that said...</i>
<i>"Today is the first day</i>
<i>of the rest of your life"?</i>
<i>Well, that's true</i>
<i>with every day except one...</i>
<i>the day you die.</i>
<i>Jane, hurry up.</i>
I've got a very important
appointment.
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
- She's always welcome.
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.
What?
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,
because of you and that way
that you behave.
- What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
- <i>Dad!</i>
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk!
- <i>It's disgusting!</i>
- You better watch yourself,
or you're going to turn into
a real bitch just like your mother!
Oh, fuck.
You ready to go?
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.
I'm going with Jane
and her mom.
Oh, morning!
<i>Yo, Ricky!</i>
- How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
Hey. Wait.
<i>I need that Super Smiley</i>
<i>with cheese ASAP!</i>
- You need more than that, my little hombre.
- <i>May I take your order?</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah! What's good here?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>
<i>Oh, well, then I guess</i>
<i>we'll just have to be bad, won't we?</i>
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,
- <i>curly fries and a vanilla shake.</i>
- <i>Make that two.</i>
<i>That'll be 7.98. Please</i>
<i>drive up to the window. Thank you.</i>
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.
Smile!
You're at Mr. Smiley's!
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?
Just $1.99 for
a limited time only.
- We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my...
- <i>Her husband.</i>
We've met before,
but something tells me...
you're going
to remember me this time.
<i>Whoa!</i>
You are so busted.
This really doesn't concern you.
Well, actually, Janine is senior
drive-thru manager, so you are on her turf.
So, this makes sense.
- Oh, Lester...
- <i>Honey, it's okay.</i>
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?
- Lester, just stop it!
- <i>No, no.</i>
You...
don't get to tell me
what to do...
ever again.
I'm sorry.
I guess we should
cool it for a while.
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.
No, no,
I understand completely.
It's...
"In order to be successful, one must
project an image of success at all times."
Stop it. Stop it.
Shit.
I have to run next door.
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right?
No.
Come on. You can tell me.
Does he have a big dick?
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay? It's not like that.
Not like what?
Doesn't he have one?
Why don't you want
to talk about it?
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.
Maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I
really don't want to hear about all that.
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it?
We got to get you
a real man.
- You got any papers?
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a
pushover. "No, I can't, really. Okay."
You should learn
to roll a joint.
<i>Oh! Hi.</i>
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- Don't know.
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.
- Hi.
Wow, look at you.
Have you been working out?
Some.
You can really tell.
Look at those arms.
You like... muscles?
I should probably
go see what Jane's up to.
<i>Where did you get that?</i>
- <i>From my job.</i>
- Don't lie to me.
Now, I saw you with him.
You were watching me?
What does he make you do?
Oh.
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...
Don't you laugh at me!
I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cock sucker!
Jesus, what is it with you?
I swear to God...
I'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again!
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot!
You're right.
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start.
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
- Get out!
You should see me fuck. I'm the
best piece of ass in three states.
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again.
What a sad...
old man you are.
Get out.
Mom... I'm leaving.
Okay.
Wear a raincoat.
I wish things would have
been better for you.
Take care of Dad.
<i>...disinvesting problems of power...</i>

- Please?
- Why not?
Dad, leave us alone!
<i>It's me.</i>
- If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
- What?
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?
Yes.
<i>You guys can't be serious. You're just</i>

- We won't have to.

- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.
- You'd be out of your mind to go with him.
- Why do you even care?
- Because you're my friend.
- She's not your friend.
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Hey, shut up, bitch!
- Jane, he's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!
We'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people!
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just... too perfect!
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not ugly.
Yes, you are.
And you're boring,
and you're totally ordinary,
<i>and you know it.</i>
You two deserve each other.
Jesus, man,
you're soaked.
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.
Are you okay?
Where's your wife?
Uh, I don't know.
Probably out fucking that dorky
Prince of Real Estate asshole.
And you know what?
I don't care.
Your wife is
with another man, and...
you don't care?
Nope.
Our marriage is just for show.
A commercial
for how normal we are...
when we're anything but.
Jesus, man,
you are shaking.
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.
Yeah.
It's okay.
I... am...
You just tell me what you need.
It's okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry.
Y-You got the wrong idea.
<i>"I refuse to be a victim."</i>
<i>When this becomes your mantra,</i>
<i>constantly reinforcing</i>
<i>your new non...</i>
I refuse to be a victim!
I hope you don't mind

<i>Not at all.</i>
Bad night?
<i>Not really bad, just...</i>
strange.
<i>Believe me, it couldn't possibly be</i>
<i>any stranger than mine.</i>
Jane and I had a fight.
It was about you.
<i>She's mad at me because...</i>
I said I think you're sexy.
Do you want a sip?
Sure.
So.
You gonna tell me?
What do you want?
I don't know.
You... don't know?
What do you want?
Are you kidding?
I want you.
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.
You don't think I'm ordinary?
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.
Thank you.
I don't think there's anything
worse than being ordinary.
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.
Lester,
I have something
I have to say to you.
Are you scared?
I don't get scared.
My parents will try
to find me.
Mine won't.
This is my first time.
You're kidding.
I'm sorry.
I still want to do it.
I just... thought
I should tell you...
in case you wondered why I...
I wasn't... better.
What's wrong?
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>I was beautiful.</i>
You <i>are</i> beautiful.
You are so... beautiful.
And I would be a very...
lucky man.
I feel so stupid.
Don't.
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.
You have nothing
to be sorry about.
It's okay.
Everything's okay.
Wow, I was starving.
- Do you want me to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?
I mean,
how's her life?
Is she happy?
Is she miserable?
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.
She's, uh...
She's really happy.
She thinks she's in love.
Good for her.
How are you?
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.
I'm great.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'm great.
Man, oh man.
Man, oh man, oh man.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Wow.
<i>I had always</i>
<i>heard your entire life flashes...</i>
<i>in front of your eyes</i>
<i>the second before you die.</i>
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>that one second...</i>
<i>isn't a second at all.</i>
<i>It stretches on forever,</i>
<i>like an ocean of time.</i>
<i>For me, it was</i>
<i>lying on my back...</i>
<i>at Boy Scout camp,</i>
<i>watching falling stars.</i>
<i>And yellow leaves</i>
<i>from the maple trees...</i>
<i>that lined our street.</i>
<i>Or my grandmother's hands</i>
<i>and the way her skin...</i>
<i>seemed like paper.</i>
<i>And the first time</i>
<i>I saw my cousin Tony's...</i>
<i>brand-new Firebird.</i>
<i>And Janie.</i>
<i>And Janie.</i>
<i>And... Carolyn.</i>
<i>I guess I could be pretty pissed off</i>
<i>about what happened to me,</i>
<i>but it's hard to stay mad when</i>
<i>there's so much beauty in the world.</i>
<i>Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing</i>
<i>it all at once and it's too much.</i>
<i>My heart fills up like a balloon</i>
<i>that's about to burst.</i>
<i>And then I remember</i>
<i>to relax...</i>
<i>and stop trying</i>
<i>to hold on to it.</i>
<i>And then it flows</i>
<i>through me like rain,</i>
<i>and I can't feel anything</i>
<i>but gratitude...</i>
<i>for every single moment...</i>
<i>of my stupid little life.</i>
<i>You have no idea what</i>
<i>I'm talking about, I'm sure.</i>
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>You will someday.</i>
<i> Hope, you enjoyed the movie!</i>
<i>       regards, shock... </i>
