<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismount!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herman's horse-sick!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaps, no one wander off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
this is such a good idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alfred, did you get anything yet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nothing.
- Then keep digging.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid's got something!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something, Garth!
I got something...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look at that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we're rich, ain't we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana? Indiana?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Cross of Coronado.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cortez gave it to him in 1520.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama, dig down</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and put it on her bony finger!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run back and find the others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have him bring the sheriff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a snake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what I said?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Run back...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, what are you gonna do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll think of something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got our thing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get him!
- Get off me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Havelock! Anybody!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's lost but me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is! Let's go! Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Come back here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Get him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come back here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy smokes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way out of this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toss up the whip.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It belongs to Coronado.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This should be in a museum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now give it back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A snake! Snake!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let him get away!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure he doesn't double back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid, out of the box, now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad...
- Out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3, 4...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Greek.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought the sheriff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the man I want to see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there were 5 or 6 of them...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad to see that</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got witnesses, 5 or 6 of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost today, kid,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it doesn't mean you have to like it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small world, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too small for two of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the second time
I've had to reclaim</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my property from you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That belongs in a museum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw him over the side.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Archeology is the search for fact...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...not truth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's truth you're interested in,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and digging up the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">70 percent of all archeology
is done in the library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Research. Reading.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next week, Egyptology</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the next hour and a half.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, I did it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how long I've
been looking for that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All my life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your treat.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My treat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shush!Shush!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, you promised...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your appointment schedule,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and these term papers
still haven't been graded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get the order they arrived...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...And I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Venice, Italy</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My men didn't alarm you, I hope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your contributions to the museum
over the years</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been extremely generous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a look over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might interest you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early Latin text.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mid-12th century, I should think.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was our assessment, as well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did this come from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while excavating for copper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you translate the inscription?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"will have a spring inside him</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"welling up for eternal life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"in the place where you dwell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Across the desert
and through the mountain</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the temple where the cup that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Arthur legend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard this bedtime story before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eternal life, Dr. Jones!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An old man's dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grail lore is his hobby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a teacher of medieval literature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one the students hope
they don't get.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walter, you're neglecting your guests.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be along in a moment, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard to resist, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What good is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty vague.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you want to start looking?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the entire top portion is missing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three brothers, to be exact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard this one, as well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">150 years after having found the Grail</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and began the long journey
back to France,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but only one of them made it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And before dying of extreme old age,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the knight promised
that two markers</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that had been left behind would.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This tablet is one of those markers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It proves the knight's story is true.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">within the city of Venice, Italy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can now see, Dr. Jones,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're about to complete a great quest</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that began almost 2,000 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're only one step away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could be more right than you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've hit a snag.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you try my father?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We already have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father is the man
who has disappeared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father and I have been
friends since time began.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've watched you grow up, Indy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've watched the two of you grow apart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has the old fool
got himself into now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's today's mail, and it's been opened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it, Marcus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Venice, Italy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Dad's Grail diary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is his whole life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would he have sent this to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but someone must want it pretty badly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe, Marcus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe the Grail actually exists?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call Donovan, Marcus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell him we'll take two</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's at your disposal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, good luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Signora? Signorina?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it was you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have your father's eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Elsa Schneider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen him
so excited.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was as giddy as a schoolboy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who? Attila the Professor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freulein, will you permit me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow I'll steal you another.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I have something to show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I left your father working in the library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roman numerals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here is the library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't look
much like a library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a converted church.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this case, it's the literal truth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are on holy ground.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, please excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The library's closing in a few moments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, I've seen this window before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here, in Dad's diary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad was onto something here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we still don't know what they mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad sent me this diary for a reason.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find something?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. 3, 7 and 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, I must be blind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was looking for the tomb itself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you get it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tomb is somewhere in the library.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said yourself it used to be a church.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7. 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now where's the 10?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around for the 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 and 7.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7 and 7</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"X" marks the spot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a great deal like your father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except he's lost, and I'm not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lower me down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look after this for me, will you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">600 years before the Crusades.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Christians would have
dug their own passages</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and burial chambers centuries later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's where we'll find him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark of the Covenant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's petroleum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should sink a well down here
and retire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the lighter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, rats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it... it must be one of these.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the artistry
of these carvings, and the scrollwork.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's this one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it. We found it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shield is the second marker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never would have
made it past the rats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hates rats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's scared to death of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Back against the wall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Under it! Air pocket!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't wander off.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I've found a way out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deep breath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Venice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crazy? Don't go between them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go between them? Are you crazy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said go around!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said go between them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, don't go between them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you trying to kill us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk or you're dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, tell me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My soul is prepared. How's yours?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your last chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, where's my father?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Kazim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why were you trying to kill me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for all that time,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me off at this jetty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it for His glory, or for yours?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In that case,
God be with you in your quest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Austrian-German border.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's the head?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better, now I've seen this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The knights of the First Crusade</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire city was destroyed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The present city of lskenderun
is built on its ruins.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Across the desert
and through the mountain</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But where exactly?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father would know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the whole history of the Grail quest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A map with no names.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the river led
into the mountains, here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight to the canyon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew everything
except where to begin,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the name of the city.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alexandretta.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now we know.
- Yes. Now we know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in lskenderun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa? Elsa?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My room...
- Mine, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were they looking for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Grail diary?
- Uh-huh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't trust me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I let you tag along.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knock it off. You're not mad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You like the way I do things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's lucky I don't do things the same way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, what do you think
is going on here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the way I think they should be done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you kiss me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I hate arrogant men.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Venice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know about this place?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know. I'll think of something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not before time!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're drenched!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you expected?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are here to view the tapestries.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tapestries?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear me, the man is dense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a castle,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we have many tapestries.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey Mouse!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nazis. I hate these guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one. I think he's in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's wired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy? lndy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. This is kid's play.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is you, Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me that, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are you doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came to get you. What do you thi...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It breaks the heart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the head. You hit me, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll never forgive myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, you can tell by the cross section.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry
about your head, though,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I thought you were one of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, they come in through the doors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But better safe than sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I was wrong this time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You obviously got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it, and I used it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found the entrance
to the catacombs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the library?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the tomb of Sir Richard?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found it</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was actually there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what was left of him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his shield,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Alexandretta."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alexandretta! Of course!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior, you did it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dad. You did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">40 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only I could have been with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were rats, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rats?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, big ones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They wanted my diary.
- Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will take the book now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What book?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the diary in your pocket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dolt!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think my son
would be that stupid</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't, did you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You didn't bring it, did you?
- Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, can we discuss this later?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you take it easy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it wouldn't fall into their hands!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came here to save you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...don't call me Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what you did!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe what you did...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa? Elsa?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down the gun, or the Freulein dies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's a Nazi.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Trust me.
-Indy,no!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will kill her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. He won't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, please! Do what he says!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't listen to her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough! She dies!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Wait...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you should have
listened to your father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know she was a Nazi?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know she was a Nazi?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She talks in her sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't trust her. Why did you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he didn't take my advice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donovan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I misjudged you, Walter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the slime of humanity.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Schneider,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are pages torn out of this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This book contained a map,
a map with no names,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">precise directions from the unknown city</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are these missing pages,
this map?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must have these pages back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wasting your breath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't tell us,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he doesn't have to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's given them to Marcus Brody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not up to the challenge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sticks out like a sore thumb.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll find him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell you will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a 2-day head start on you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is more than he needs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brody's got friends
in every town and village</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from here to the Sudan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll blend in, disappear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never see him again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone here speak English?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or even ancient Greek?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water? No, thank you, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Fish make love in it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I really don't want...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, thank you very much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Brody!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah. What a relief.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus Brody, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A slight detour.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are on your own?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.
But where are we going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This map will show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was drawn by...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Brody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to lskenderun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The director
of the Museum of Antiquities</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has sent a car for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your servant, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I am his.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My reputation precedes me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no museum in lskenderun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papers, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papers? Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Run.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papers. Got it here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just finished reading it myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Run.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you say...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the back door! Find the back door!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Intolerable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must return immediately.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
- So?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at lskenderun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me kill them now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll need them alive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always do what the doctor orders.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look at me like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both wanted the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have done anything to get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would have done the same.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry you think so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't forget how wonderful it was.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was rather wonderful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Schneider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your car is waiting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how Austrians say good-bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked the Austrian way better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try and get these ropes loose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said he had 2 days start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding? I made that up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I looking for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My lucky charm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feels like a cigarette lighter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try and burn through the ropes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ought to tell you something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get sentimental now, Dad.
Save it till we get out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The floor's on fire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the chair.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move it out of here! Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's scorching the table! Fast!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move!
- Okay!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we have Marcus Brody,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but more important, we have the map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Secrecy essential to success.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Eliminate the American conspirators."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Head for the fireplace!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can get these ropes off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoops!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our situation has not improved.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alarm!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is intolerable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm out, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's got to be a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A secret door or a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Passageway or something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find that if I just sit down and think...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...The solution presents itself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. More boats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! But better than most.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the boat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going on the boat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halt! Halt!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop!
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brody's this way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My diary's in Berlin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need the diary, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus has the map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is more in the diary
than just the map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Dad. Tell me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What final challenge?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three devices of such lethal cunning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Booby traps?
- Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you remember?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half the German army's on our tail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Into the lion's den?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing that matters is the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Marcus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus would agree with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two selfless martyrs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for blasphemy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The quest for the Grail
is not archeology.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a race against evil.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is captured by the Nazis,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the Earth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an obsession, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never understood it. Never.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did Mom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, she did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only too well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until all I could do was mourn her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freulein Doctor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is it?
- How did you get here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it? I want it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came back for the book? Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father didn't want it incinerated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you think of me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you stood up to be counted</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who gives a damn what you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have to do is squeeze.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have to do is scream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you get?
- I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First available flight out of Germany.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we made it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I'll share that sentiment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tickets, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guten Tag, Herr Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tickets, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No ticket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticket!
Ticket!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ticket!
- Ticket!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not all we shared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her grandfather.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm as human as the next man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was the next man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ships that pass in the night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a milkshake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did we talk about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't talk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We never talked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I detect a rebuke?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I was a wonderful father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wash your ears? Do your homework?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you taught me was
that I was less important to you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I learned it so well</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left just when
you were becoming interesting</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad, how can you...
- Very well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want to talk about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't think of anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you complaining about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we have work to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we get to Alexandretta,
we will face 3 challenges.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first, "The Breath of God.
Only the penitent man will pass."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second, "The Word of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Third, "The Path Of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. We'll find out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're turning around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're taking us back to Germany.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to figure out the radio was dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you could fly a plane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Land,no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it ready.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11 o'clock!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, 11 o'clock!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens at 11 o'clock?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12, 11, 10.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11 o'clock, fire!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, are we hit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More or less.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Dad. We're going in!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice landing.
- Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those people are trying to kill us!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well. It's a new experience for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It happens to me all the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is intolerable!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could be close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster, boy! Faster!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they don't come
any closer than that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, he's coming back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and the birds in the sky."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These pages are taken from
Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they include a map</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see,
the Grail is all but in our hands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, Your Highness,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nor of removing the Grail
from your borders</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without suitable compensation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you brought?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious valuables, Your Highness,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4.3 liter, 30 horsepower,
6-cylinder engine,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in 12.5 seconds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I even like the color.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shall have camels, horses,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an armed escort, provisions,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">desert vehicles and tanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no time to lose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go this way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that camel out of the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to Marcus, Sallah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They set out across the desert
this afternoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they have the map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in this sort of race,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no silver medal
for finishing second.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather spit in your face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as I haven't got any spit...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be within three or four miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise we are off the map.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see Brody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He seems okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've got a tank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6-pound gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we're well out of range.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That car belonged to my brother-in-law.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see anyone up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it wasn't even Jones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it is him, all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here somewhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put Brody in the tank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in this sun,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without transportation,
they're as good as dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Jones, all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, who are all these people?
- Who cares?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going after those horses.
- I'll take the camels.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't need camels.
- But, Indy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No camels.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A messenger from God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the unrighteous,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Genius of the Restoration..."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Aid our own resuscitation."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, what are you doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is in this book?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That miserable little diary of yours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have the map. The book is useless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">VVhy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you hiding?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">should try reading books
instead of burning them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones is getting away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think not,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herr Donovan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that Jones, the other Jones!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah, I said no camels!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 5 camels. Can't you count?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, your father and Brody...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my father?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the belly of that steel beast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Junior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Get out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, the pen...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- But don't you see?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pen is mightier than the sword.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what you did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's war.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this archeology?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of there, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does one get off this thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Marcus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father of Indy, give me your hand!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Dad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hand!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I never told him anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wasn't ready, Marcus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes would have been enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I'd lost you, boy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you had too, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Helmut, another volunteer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never expected to see you again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to recover the Grail for us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As what? A Nazi stooge like you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nazis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the limit of your vision?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nazis want to write themselves
into the Grail legend,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take on the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they're welcome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I want the Grail itself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cup that gives everlasting life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler can have the world,
but he can't take it with him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Grail is mine,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're going to get it for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shooting me won't get you anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something, Dr. Jones?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Get back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't save him when you're dead!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The healing power of the Grail</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the only thing
that can save your father now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Breath of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only the penitent man will pass."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The penitent man will pass."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man will pass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only the penitent man will pass."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man... The penitent...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man is humble before God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penitent. Penitent...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penitent man is humble,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kneels before God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kneel!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm through!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second challenge:
"The Word of God."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Word of God...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Word of...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">-"The Word of God..."
- No, Henry. Try not to talk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name of God...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name of God...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jehovah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">J...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiot!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Latin, Jehovah starts with an</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"E."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"H."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"O."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"V."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Path of God."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the leap from the lion's head</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"will he prove his worth."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible, nobody can jump this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, you must hurry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come quickly!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a leap of faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, geez...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must believe, boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd come,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my strength has left me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last of three brothers</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who swore an oath to find the Grail</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to guard it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was 700 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A long time to wait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're strangely dressed, for a knight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not exactly...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A knight? What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was chosen</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honor was mine until another came</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to challenge me to single combat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pass it to you who vanquished me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I don't have time to explain, but...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must choose,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but choose wisely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For as the true Grail will bring you life,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the false Grail</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will take it from you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a historian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea what it looks like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me choose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Doctor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This certainly is the cup of
the King of Kings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eternal life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is happening to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, what is happening?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He chose</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">poorly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would not be made out of gold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the cup of a carpenter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way to find out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have chosen wisely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your guns. Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, come on, get to your feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have got it. Come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa! Elsa, don't move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, don't cross the Seal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, don't. Elsa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can reach it. I can reach it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior, give me your other hand!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can almost reach it, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa never really believed in the Grail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She thought she'd found a prize.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you find, Dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illumination.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did you find, Junior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Junior"? Dad...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.</font>
