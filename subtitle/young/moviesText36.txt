<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, let's do this one last time.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter Parker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for 10 years, I've been the one...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and only...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With great power comes
great responsibility.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then I saved the city again.
And again and again and again.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I did, uh...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I did this.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We don't really talk about this.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, I'm a comic book. I'm a cereal.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Did a Christmas album.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have an excellent theme song.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And a so-so popsicle.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, I've looked worse.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But after everything...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I still love being Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, who wouldn't?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So no matter how many hits I take...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I always find a way to come back.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...is me.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's only one Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And you're lookin' at him.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, papa, time for school!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles!
- Yeah! Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you finished packing for school?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just ironing my last shirt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! You a grown man now.
Let's show these teachers that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my laptop?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dad, I'll walk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles! Gotta go.
- In a minute!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gotta go.
- In a minute!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, I gotta go.
- In a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Miles!
You feel that earthquake last night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How's that new school?
- So easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We miss you, Miles.
- You miss me? I still live here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you miss me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Contra!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can walk plenty on Saturday
when you peel those stickers off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw that? I don't know if that was me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the two from yesterday on Clinton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, those were me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. Another new coffee shop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Foam Party"? Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that a coffee shop or a disco?
- Dad, you're old, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There are multiple reports of another
mysterious seismic event last night.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man.
I mean, this guy swings in once a day...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Dad. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, my guys are out there...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...lives on the line, no masks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With great ability comes
great accountability.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even how the saying goes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh. Don't cops run red lights?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, some do. But not your dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I go back to Brooklyn Middle?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've given it 2 weeks.
We're not having this conversation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just think that this new school is elitist.
- "Elitist"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would prefer to be
at a normal school among the people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The people"? These are your people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only here
'cause I won that stupid lottery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. You passed the entry test
just like everybody else.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna end up like your uncle?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all make choices in life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
- You wanna hear me say it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're dropping me off at a school.
- "I love you, Dad."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at this place.
- "Dad, I love you."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a copy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tie your shoes, please.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I love you, Dad."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, good morning. How you doin'?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weekend was short, huh?
- "That's a copy."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh! This is embarrassing.
We wore the same jacket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Your shoe's untied.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm aware. It's a choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who can solve this for XY?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is known as a syllogism.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Read two chapters
of Great Expectations.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A take-home quiz on volumetric pressure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5-page essay
with your conclusions stressed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...countless other possibilities.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There could be a universe
where I am wearing red.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Or wearing leather pants.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Einstein said time was relative, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. It was just so quiet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to keep standing there,
or do you wanna sit down?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our universe is, in fact,
one of many parallel universes...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...happening at the exact same time.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thanks to everyone here
at the Fisk Family Foundation...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I liked your joke.
- Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was smart, so I liked it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I've seen you before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Every choice that we make...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...would create countless
other possibilities.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A what-if to infinity.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A zero?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few more of those, you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'm just not right for this school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...on a true-or-false quiz at random...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...do you know
what score they would get?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 50%?
- That's right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way to get all the answers wrong
is to know which answers are right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying to quit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not gonna let you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assigning you a personal essay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not about physics, but about you...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and what kind of person
you want to be.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron! Hey! Were you scared?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's up with school?
- Going great! Got tons of friends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't tell me it's all that bad there.
Smart girls is where it's at.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place must be full of 'em.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there's no one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine
on the streets with no game.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got game.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a new girl. Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me. You know how it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's her name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we layin' down
the groundwork right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know about the shoulder touch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Course I do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But tell me anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You serious, Uncle Aaron?
- I'm tellin' you, man, it's science.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So walk up to her and be like: "Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no. Like: "Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. "Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure you my nephew, man?
Is that her?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naw, man. You know my dad. I can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
I got a spot you ain't gon' believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naw, I can't. I can't. Can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get in so much trouble.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man.
Tell him your art teacher made you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you know about this place?
- Did an engineering job down here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man, I knew we were related.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a lot of history on these walls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so fresh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you on your own, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, slow down a little.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what you got now?
Makin' mistakes is part of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real Miles comin' outta hidin'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you can cut that line
with another color.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little help?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you want drips?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if you do, that's cool,
but if you don't, you gotta keep it moving.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's intentional.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it too crazy?
- No, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop lyin'.
- It's true.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good guy, just...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm sayin'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come on, man. I gotta roll.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's weird.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My pants shrank.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I hit puberty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta get new pants.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wait. Why is the voice in my head
so loud?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why am I so sweaty?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you so sweaty?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a puberty thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, but I'm done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're, like, new here, right?
We got that in common.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's one thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Gwe... anda.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, your name is Gwanda?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's African. I'm South African.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No accent though
'cause I was raised here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do the shoulder touch now
before she walks away.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is this so scary?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, crap.
- Can you let go, please?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't let go.
- Calm down. It's fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, let go.
- Workin' on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just puberty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you know what puberty is.
Just relax.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, I have a plan.
- Great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna pull really hard.
- That's a terrible plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 1.
- Don't do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 2.
- 3!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. Total pleasure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one saw. It's okay.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one knows, no one knows.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everyone knows.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everyone knows. They're talkin'
'bout me. They saw everything!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He knows. She knows. They know.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wow, she's super tall.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is he smiling? Am I
the weird guy now? What am I doing?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy's such a weirdo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How do I stop?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can they hear my thoughts?!
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I know you snuck out last night,
Morales.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Play dumb!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Morales?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not that dumb!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, okay. You're okay. You're okay.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He'll never find you.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing in my office,
Morales?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morales! Open up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this happening?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a nice voice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop sticking!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep sticking, Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Hofstadter is suggesting...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is that we...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...look on the...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My room!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Why is this happening?"</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Please stop sticking."</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Please keep st..."</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wait, wait, wait.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could there be two Spider-Men?
There can't be two Spider-Men.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can there?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, Uncle Aaron, pick up. Pick up!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yo, it's Aaron. I'm outta town for a few
days. I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No. No-No-No-No-No.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's not possible!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's just puberty.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta tell someone.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the spider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a normal spider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm right here.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is this happening to me?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Way over there.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're like me.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Miles. Look out.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I don't wanna be a hero.
- Miles.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Norman, listen to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Spider-Man?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn is not zoned for that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not up to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why won't you quit?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked
into a black hole.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm gonna go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this place?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know your shoes are untied?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a onesie,
so I don't really have to worry about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a lot going through your head,
I'm sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be fine. I can help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...before the space-time continuum
collapses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you in a bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How does he do that?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it here? No, no, it's here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, folks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always get this wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prowler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I was in the middle of something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so tired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That all you got?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, so gross.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I should go up there and help him.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like my new toy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cost me a fortune,
but, hey, can't take it with you, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came all this way. Watch the test.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a hell of a freaking light show.
You're gonna love this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, don't do this! Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see multiple dimensions opening!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was 3, 4
and 5 separate dimensions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unstable! We should stop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Norm, what's your take on head trauma?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to warn you, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goblin, no! Get him outta there!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wilson! Where are we?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Really weird.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wilson!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't you get up?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I always get up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The coughing's probably not a good sign.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find him. Now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This override key is the only way
to stop the collider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to hide your face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't tell anyone who you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he turns the machine on again,
everything you know will disappear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family, everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promise me you'll do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Destroy the collider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come and find you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tombstone. We're done with tests.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that thing ready to go again.
And soon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run faster!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys are weak.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say it's nice to see you again,
Spider-Man, but it's not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kingpin. How's business?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boomin'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might open a black hole
under Brooklyn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be worth the risk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not always about the money,
Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're trying to do...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and it won't work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the body.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill that guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop sticking!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police! Put your hands up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Miles?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you at school?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Que te pasa?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the earthquake?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I sleep here tonight?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles. It's a weeknight.
You made a commitment to that school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's upset.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you can stay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really hate Spider-Man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeff, mi amor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? He asked me. Baby, you know
how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that about?
- He's having a hard time, Jeff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it gets hard,
that's when he's gotta stick it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sad news tonight.
The hero known as Spider-Man...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...has died after injuries related to another
powerful earthquake in Brooklyn.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Multiple sources are confirming
that Peter Parker...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...a 26-year-old grad student
and part-time photographer...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...operated as Spider-Man
for at least a decade.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane,
and his aunt, May Parker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My husband, Peter Parker...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...was an ordinary person.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to miss him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were friends, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I return it if it doesn't fit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It always fits...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...eventually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He didn't ask for his powers...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My favorite thing about Peter...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...is that he made us each feel powerful.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in our own way...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we are all Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And we're all counting on you.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're counting on me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing you gave me, that key...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I think I really messed it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna do what you asked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure I'm the guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this without you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I do to him?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for the last 22 years...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I broke my back, a drone flew
into my face, I buried Aunt May.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My wife and I... split up.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I handled it like a champion.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause, you know what, no matter how
many times I get hit, I always get back up.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I got a lot of time to reflect
and work on myself.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Could you imagine?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A seahorse seeing another seahorse...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and then making it work?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She wanted kids and...
And it scared me.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Flash-forward:
I'm in my apartment doing push-ups...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...doing ab crunches, getting strong...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...when this weird thing happened.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I gotta say,
weird things happen to me a lot.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But this was real weird.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Also, I was dead.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And blond.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was kind of perfect.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It was like looking in a mirror.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have a feeling that the thing that brought
me here was the thing that got him killed.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You wanna know what happened next?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Me, too.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doin' over there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze! PDNY.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me right now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotcha. I gotcha.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid. Drop the body.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, kid. Get over here!
- Come on, now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you, officers!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, kid.
- Kid, come on, now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put 'em up, son!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... adiós?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Somebody stop that train!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey. What the...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna die!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Looks like a child dressed
like Spider-Man...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! I didn't kill you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why are you trying to kill me?
- I'm not. I'm trying to save you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, maybe you guys can go around?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Thanks, New York.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What was that?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Kid electrocuted me...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...with his hands.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're like me.
- I got some questions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you look like Peter Parker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I am Peter Parker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you older?
And why is your body...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a different shape?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure you just called me fat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look so hot either, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a ghost?
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you from another dimension?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a parallel universe where things
are like this universe but different?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're Spider-Man in that universe?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But somehow traveled to this universe,
but you don't know how?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow. That was really just a guess?
- We learned about it in physics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can teach me
like Peter said he would.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before he died.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I made a promise to him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's lesson number 1, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, seriously...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, kid.
This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on with your body?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think my atoms are real jazzed
about being in the wrong dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm not looking for a side gig
as a Spider-Man coach.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a lot going on in my dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"With great power comes great..."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you dare finish that sentence.
Don't do it! I'm sick of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got
a supercollider. He's tryin' to kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goodbye.
- Where you going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it runs again,
I'll jump in and get back to my life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't let them run it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm supposed to destroy it so it never
runs again or everyone's gonna die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there's always a little bit of time
before everybody dies...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and that's when I do my best work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you gonna need this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, you have a goober. Give it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need it to destroy the collider.
- I need it to go home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I said...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The collider created a portal
that brought me here. And I have to get...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember what happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, this is why I never had kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't we make another one?
- We can't do anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you, I have to re-steal
what your guy stole from Alchemax...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and make another one of these.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...everyone in this city, my parents,
my uncle and millions of others, will die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're just gonna go home and
leave me here to figure this out for myself?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Making you feel guilty. Is it working?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could it...? No. Look at me.
Does it look like it's working?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, it's not...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No! Do not let him win!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, kid. You win.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we don't have a second to lose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this burger. So delicious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the best burgers I've ever had.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my universe,
this place closed 6 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why. I really don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we focus?
- Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm listening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other Peter said he was
gonna be showing me the ropes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any Spider-Man tips
you can tell me now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got plenty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disinfect the mask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna wanna use baby powder
in the suit, heavy on the joints.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want any chafing, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look up where Alchemax is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can teach me
to swing on the way there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley,
Miles. Not after a hearty burger breakfast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that off. It's disrespectful.
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So how do we retrace Peter's steps?
- That's a good question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would I do if I were me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 1: I infiltrate the lab.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>2: Find the head scientist's computer.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That lady with the bike is the head
scientist. I saw her in this documentary.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Cool! Step 3:
I reexamine my personal biases.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 4: I hack the computer.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not technically hacking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not now. I just lost my train of thought.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 5: Download the important stuff.
I'll know it when I see it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 6: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what am I doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step 7: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do
Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I get stuck with the janky,
old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's new.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What am I doing? What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just move over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man
die without doing anything about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not doing that again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so you're a nice change of pace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you can't really understand it,
but these are really good numbers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I got the password.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see this? And this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is multiple dimensions beginning
to crash into each other.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this. He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got 24 hours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What this means is there could be
a rupture in the space-time continuum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's bad. Actually, everything
she said was bad. I was lying before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. Let me get you some more data.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, relax your fingers. We don't
have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need more time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're right there.
They're gonna see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, you gotta unstick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do to relax?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. Okay, okay, okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for crying out loud.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teenagers: just the worst.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just poked me in my eye!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember this password.
D-g-f-a-m-p-e-s-a-n-d...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.
You're supposed to be dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is fascinating.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's my face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An entirely different Peter Parker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little bit of a gut,
perhaps from dimensional warping.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Travel through the multiverse appears
to have deteriorated the...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the rest?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how old are you?
'Cause you don't look a day over 35.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You showed 'em you're not crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might pinch a little.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I just need to get these samples.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Organize your desktop, lady.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Just complete cellular decay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen anything like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking the whole thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And obviously you've been glitching.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Glitchin"? No.
Why would you even say that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stay in this dimension too long,
your body's gonna disintegrate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't imagine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I, for one...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...can't wait to watch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say your name was?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Olivia Octavius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I assume
that your friends call you Doc Ock?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends actually call me Liv.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My enemies call me Doc Ock.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this! Run!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking to?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it handled, buddy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is fine!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, this is a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you give me that back,
young man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's proprietary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This'd be a good time to turn invisible.
- Yep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Act super normal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, that's funny, I get that a lot.
- Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we do a switchy-switchy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back here!
Where do you think you're going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took a bagel!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Time to swing, just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this yet!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody knows
that the best way to learn...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is under intense
life-threatening pressure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing down there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I run better than I swing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta swing or they'll catch you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what you wanted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back, little boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shoot off your back foot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the best idea you've had all day!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice, Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. You're doin' it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thwip and release.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a natural. Thwip. Release.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Feel the rhythm?
- Thwip. And release!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good, Miles.
- I gotta say, you're amazing, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a little team!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me as the teacher who could still do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You as the student who can do it,
just not as good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of us. Is there something
you want to say to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the...?
- Who did that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gwanda?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Gwen, actually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know her. Very cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from another dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, another-another dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Gwen Stacy.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for the last 2 years, I've been
the one and only Spider-Woman.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You guys know the rest.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I joined a band.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Saved my dad.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I couldn't save my best friend...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...Peter Parker...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...so now I save everyone else.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I don't do friends anymore...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...just to avoid any distractions.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And one day this weird thing happened.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I mean, like, really weird.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was blown into last week.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Literally.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lucky for these folks,
Spider-Man was there to save the day.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you guys are early.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wasn't sure why until I met you.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your haircut.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get to like my haircut.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many more Spider-People
are there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save it for Comic-Con.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's Comic-Con?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're dead, Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilson! What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa! Richard!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I just see two more?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's three, actually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is good. This is very, very good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This means you get what you want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means my collider works.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the collider will bring
your family back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As many families as you want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, at my collider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our collider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He broke this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed
about it, so just keep it between us, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where we can make a new one.
And we won't let him break it this time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about your friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how hard this is. To have
to figure this stuff out on your own.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever decide to do friends again,
I could always open up a slot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll keep you posted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should probably go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
- Just relax.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are all very sweet,
but no more fans today, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not ready for this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Aunt May.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An alternate dimension.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look tired, Peter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I am tired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup, that's what they are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when it all happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what dimension are you from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Peter have a place where we could
make another one of these?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A goober.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. A little,
old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this place is pretentious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude. Was yours anything like this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine was like this,
but take away the jeep, the plane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel sad for this guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Peter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is a cape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter knew how dangerous the job was.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy was Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin knows we're coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to be outnumbered.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be so sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might need these.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fellas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he in black and white?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever I go, the wind follows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the wind, it smells like rain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, guys!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could literally not get any weirder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can get weirder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other reason.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're like me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter Parker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peni Parker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter Porker.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
- I was bitten by a radioactive pig.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>In my universe, it's 1933,
and I'm a private eye.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I like to drink egg creams,
and I like to fight Nazis. A lot.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm from New York in the year 3145.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have a psychic link with a spider
who lives inside my father's robot.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And we're best friends. Forever.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sometimes I let matches burn down

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I frolic and I dance
And I do this with my pants</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Enough!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how did you get here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's kind of a long story.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe not that long.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now we're just trying
to find a way home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way home is back through
that collider gizmo. The only trouble is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. You guys don't get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And he's gonna save the multiverse.
- Yeah, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This kid can turn himself invisible.
Watch this. He can do it now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is cool.
Show 'em the zappy thing, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just those two things.
- Just those two things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he's gonna get us home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, little fella, Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talkin' hard boys, real biscuit boxers.
Can you fight them all off at once?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't actually fought anyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprise attack!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Show me!
- Surprise attack!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you swing and flip with the grace
of a trained dancer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so she can get out
of the dang house once in a while?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you be strong?
- Ruthless?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Disciplined?
- I don't know. Maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Psychic?
- Show me some moxie, soldier!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Above all, no matter how many times
you get hit, can you get back up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you think you can't keep goin'...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Miles.
- Come on. You can do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can do this.
- Guys, cool it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on. You can do it!
- Get up, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Miles. Get up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's not ready. It's obvious.
- There's no way. He's just a kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he can't do this,
we have to stay and do it for him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that? He can, um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can turn invisible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Miles, what is going on with you?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nobody's heard from you.
We don't know what's going on.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If you're hidin' something from us,
you need to come clean.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You call me back. Now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not answering me either.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's Aaron. I'm outta town for a few days.
I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aaron, it's Jeff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I need you to call me
if you've heard from Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He has a...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He has a soft spot for you...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and we haven't heard from him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know I wouldn't reach out
if this wasn't important.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you're good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dear Uncle Aaron.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta do something,
and I don't know if I can do it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm scared, man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm just tired of lettin' everybody down.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're the only one I can talk to.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I just wish you were here.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Mr. Fisk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got the security tapes
from the tunnel right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the kid's out there, I'll find him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me, sir. I don't ever quit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Purple.
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blue?
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has anyone heard from Miles?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, he's just clearing his head.
I know the kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got what it takes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you he's gonna come back through
that door, recharged and ready to fight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My uncle Aaron, he's the Prowler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down, Miles.
- He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a pretty hard-core origin story.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cute place. Real homey.
- Oh, great. It's Liv.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I was followed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you mind taking this outside?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I think I'll be taking that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand, niñito, dale. Prepárate a morir.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, stupid pillows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, take it outside!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave the kid alone!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta go, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All vehicles in the area,
we have a disturbance...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...involving multiple Spider... people?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. On my way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be stupid, kid. Hand it over, now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nowhere left to run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Uncle Aaron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Prowler.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you waitin' for? Finish it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted you to look up to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I let you down, man. I let you down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the best of all of us, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on your way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your arms up. Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aaron. Aaron, no. No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All units.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want an APB on a new Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bud.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've all been there.
You know, for me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it was my Uncle Ben.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my Uncle Benjamin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my best friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, the hardest thing about this job is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you can't always save everybody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, we're probably the only ones
who do understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That way, that way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other way, other way,
other way, other way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do animals talk in this dimension?
'Cause I don't wanna freak him out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, I came to say goodbye.
- We can say goodbye at the collider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not getting it.
You're staying here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to be there.
So you can all go home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing what needs to be done.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about MJ?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everything works out, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the goober.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't make me take it from you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not fair!
You gotta tell them I can do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't their decision.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm ready. I promise!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then venom-strike me right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know
how much you want this, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor little guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you don't have it yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When will I know I'm ready?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't. It's a leap of faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it is, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A leap of faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, it's your dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please open the door.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, can we talk for a minute?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something happened to...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't want
that to happen to us, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I don't always do what you need
me to do or say what you need me to say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's yours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, call me when you can. Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to say it back, though.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took you long enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I see this spark in you. It's amazing.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our family doesn't run from things.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're the best of all of us, Miles.
You're on your way.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just keep going.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When do I know I'm Spider-Man?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You won't.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's all it is, Miles.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A leap of faith.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Made 'em myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They fit perfectly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin has a private elevator entrance
from his penthouse to the collider below.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't count on having an audience.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. It's nice to be with you
this evening to celebrate Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He and I were very close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a pig.
- I'm right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. Get a load
of how the waiters are dressed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in poor taste, but...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be that easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanna thank Mary Jane Parker
for being here this evening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MJ?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I'll be right back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter! Come here. Trust me. I've
been there. You gotta move on, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will take 1 second. Let me just... Oh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- Oh, wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wondered if we could have
some more bread at table 12.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just... I'm really sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Don't be sorry. It's just bread.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even try.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fine.
You know, I should really get going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I could do better if I just had
another chance to give you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the bread that you deserve.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- We'll take care of that bread right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's been nice talking to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, they should fill this place up
with fresh bread.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, 'cause we are not getting
any bread.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just sorry my family can't see
what we're doing here tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Initializing primary ignition sequence.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the sequence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beginning scan for dimensional matches.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Secondary ignition in 5, 4...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...3, 2, 1.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, you don't have to stay behind.
I can do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've made up my mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you're gone, I'll blow it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know we're here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you again, Peter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I got you covered!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys are the pits.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this always difficult?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you going, Peter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any last words?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a minute to think about it?
You have a pen?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, Peter Parker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did that?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles?
- Spider-Man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow, Miles. You're doing it on command!
- It's about time, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you! I am so proud of you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I want kids?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I forgot about her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, that doesn't look promising.
- No, it doesn't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I've got genetic matches. Hold on.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too risky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up and turn it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On your left!
- On your right!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got 5 o'clock!
3 o'clock! 2 o'clock!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every direction!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to a shelter. I'll be right there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried the school, but I can't get through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, are you seeing this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does look cool though, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get back up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that all you got? You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hard-boiled turtle slapper!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a problem with cartoons?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blammo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did that feel like a cartoon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gwen!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. I made it myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Never mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's end this thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go. I'm the one with the goo...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you gotta be kidding me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles!
- Be careful!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We taught him that, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alert! Quantum polarity
has been reversed.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess this is it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, nice to know we're not alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the portal open. You first, Peni.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From both of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh, love you all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm taking this cube thing with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to have this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll fit in your pocket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all, folks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he allowed to say that, legally?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I get to like the hairdo now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'm older than you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">15 months, but it's pretty significant
if you ask me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you around, Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your turn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going anywhere!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll hold him off. You shut this down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, that wasn't the deal!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither can I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it is okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta go home, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a leap of faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry! That's cheating.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Adiós.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta get to that button.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where am I?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilson?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this what you want, man?
- What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa. Vanessa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me. You know me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're leaving now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not stopping this. Not today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am stopping this. Right now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need backup.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're nothing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took my family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up, Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up! Come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll always have my family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever hear of the shoulder touch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Miles? Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're probably busy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No! I can talk, I can talk.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, so I came by earlier because...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know who did it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Miles, what I said at the door...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it wasn't just talk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you know, I was thinking
maybe we could find a nice wall...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...privately owned,
like at the police station...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and you could "throw up"
some of your art.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I'm bad at this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Officer.
- Spider-Man!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, down there, that was...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I owe you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I look forward to workin' with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me, too. I guess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't approve of your methods...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your bravery tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look behind you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Cool. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks, Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man, a su servicio. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, man. What's up, little man?
- New Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.
Check it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was part of the move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?
For real this time. This is it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for like 2 days, I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I think you know the rest.
I finished my essay.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Saved a bunch of people.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got hit by a drone.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I did this with my dad.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Met my roommate. Finally.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Slapped a sticker
where my dad's never gonna find it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And when I feel alone, like no one
understands what I'm going through...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I remember my friends who get it.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I never thought
I'd be able to do any of this stuff.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I can.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anyone can wear the mask.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You could wear the mask.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause I'm Spider-Man.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I'm not the only one.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not by a long shot.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles. Miles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a minute?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're a bit late.
- We can't all be everywhere at once.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little text might've been nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was gone for less than 2 hours.
What happened?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I know what it looks like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The multiverse didn't collapse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it worked out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great story. Did you finish the goober?
- It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you always have to call me out?
It's just really frustrating and bums me out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get excited, Miguel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you could be the first person
to make an autonomous multiverse jump.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the last.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's start at the beginning one last time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth '67.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! What the...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Spider-Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's rude to point.
- You're being very rude.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one pointed first?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at your finger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't seen pointing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!</font>
