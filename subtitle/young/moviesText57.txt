Be thou, Aragorn, well.
Father.
Father.
I give hope to the DÃºnedain.
I have kept no hope for myself.
Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!
Out of the Great Sea...
...to Middle-Earth I am come.
In this place will I abide...
...and my heirs...
...unto the ending of the world.
Thank you.
The sea calls us home.
