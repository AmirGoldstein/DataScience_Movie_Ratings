1
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,600
JEWS FORBIDDEN

2
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,866
You!

3
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,077
Come here!

4
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,002
Why didn't you bow?

5
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,214
I'm sorry.

6
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,060
You are forbidden
to walk on the pavement.

7
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,271
Walk in the gutter!

8
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,815
I didn't come here to listen to the music.
- Hey, what's going on?

9
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,986
Are you bored?
- You're cold? Come on, move!

10
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,158
Move on!
- Yeah! That's it! Dance!

11
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,912
Dance!
- Come on, dance! Go on!

12
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:33,172
Yeah, that's nice. And you?
Don't you wanna dance, too?

13
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:38,761
Now we clear the street for
a Jewish dance floor.

14
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,597
And... you...

15
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,809
Yes, you both!

16
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,902
Faster!

17
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,114
That's nice.

18
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,284
And faster! Yeah...

19
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,914
Go!
- And faster!

20
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,126
I said, faster!

21
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:16,257
Move on! Move! Faster!

22
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,885
I said, dance!

23
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,198
Good, they're here,

24
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,943
You little bastard!

25
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,326
Stop it, stop it!

26
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,537
Stop it! Stop!

27
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,875
Come on, come on! Come on boy.

28
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,297
Come on.

29
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,134
Stand up, stand up!

30
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,638
Stand up, stand up!

31
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,904
Lights! Lights!

32
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,176
Open up! Light on!

33
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,056
Quick! Come here!

34
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,558
Stay!

35
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,896
Open up! Come on! No luggage!

36
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,693
Open up!
- No, please, no!

37
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,113
We didn't do anything, please, no!

38
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,834
Stand up!

39
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,088
You, stand up! Get up!

40
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,259
Throw him out!

41
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,565
Ah!
- Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake!

42
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,568
My God!

43
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,706
Come on! Run! Run!
- Run!

44
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,511
Hey, Mr Rubinstein.
- You... bandit!

45
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,432
Boom, boom. Dead!
- I am really scared.

46
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,603
For this joke Mr Rubinstein
gets a cigarette, hm?

47
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,815
Cigarettes, thank you.

48
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,362
Right. All men are created equal.

49
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,950
Only the Germans are created
a little more equal.

50
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,345
Out! Assemble in the yard!

51
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,857
Out! Assemble in the yard!
Go, go, go, go!

52
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:50,698
We're employed here.
We've got certificates.

53
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,913
Here.

54
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,083
You, to the left!

55
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,752
You!

56
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,964
You! You!

57
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,385
You!

58
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,888
You!

59
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,308
You!

60
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:29,445
The rest of you get dressed and then
report back here. Bring your belongings.

61
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,700
Fifteen kilos only.
- Where are you taking us?

62
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,245
Left about turn!

63
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,457
Forward, march!

64
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,436
Left about turn!

65
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,647
Forward, march!

66
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,195
Stop! Come here!
- Stop!

67
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:59,374
What's that?
- A working column.

68
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,296
Right turn!

69
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:14,306
You, come here!

70
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,726
You!

71
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,396
You! You!

72
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,733
You!

73
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,571
Down!

74
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:32,783
Down!

75
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,188
Left about turn!

76
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,400
Forward, march!

77
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,629
Did you fix the car?

78
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,394
You know, it'll break!

79
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,687
Get him away from here.

80
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,287
Assemble! Fall in!

81
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,289
Carry on.

82
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:55,540
Carry on.

83
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:46,049
What are you doing?
Go on working!

84
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:18,039
It's so cold.
- Potatoes. Once again potatoes.

85
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:32,257
Any fucking plaster?

86
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,010
Yes.

87
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,227
What were you up to?

88
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:47,814
Nothing.
What the fuck are those?

89
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,694
We're allowed
to take food into the ghetto.

90
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,072
Three kilos of potatoes and a...

91
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:59,284
Open it.

92
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,661
Yes.

93
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:07,750
It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying, I can smell it.

94
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,546
Open it.
- Yes, yes.

95
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,575
I... I...
- Potatoes.

96
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,373
You're all the same.

97
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,793
Give a Jew a little finger...

98
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,213
he takes the whole hand.

99
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:12,774
You lie to me again
and I'll shoot you personally.

100
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,518
Stop!

101
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,105
Oh, shit.
- Just wait!

102
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:57,026
What's going in here?

103
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:08,371
I'll soon teach you discipline!
Jew pigs!

104
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,961
Know why we beat you?
- No.

105
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,548
Know why we beat you?
- Why?

106
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,051
To celebrate New Year's eve!

107
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:30,017
Now, march! Go on, march!
- Beware, go on! And sing!

108
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,896
Sing something cheerful!
And sing it now and loud!

109
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:05,678
Do you have a cigarette?

110
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,932
Do you have a match?

111
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,728
DO NOT PASS

112
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,550
Unit, move!

113
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:40,973
Fischke, go to the 4th floor!

114
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:45,477
I'm there. There's no one.

115
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:50,149
Go on. Check the attic.

116
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,656
I'm checking the attic.

117
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,493
No one to see over here.

118
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:09,126
Then come down!
- Yeah, come down!

119
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:45,360
Any news from your mother?
- Nothing since three weeks.

120
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:50,115
If she were in trouble,
you would know it.

121
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:55,579
But how? I'm in worrying about her.

122
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:01,793
Don't worry.

123
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:56,138
As I said repeatedly:
this side first!

124
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:59,267
Just like this.

125
01:55:00,936 --> 01:55:06,691
Just let them step away
before shooting, asshole.

126
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,248
Good, now the hospital!

127
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,599
What, here? Are you sure?

128
01:58:41,239 --> 01:58:46,244
You mean, that's the hut?
- It has to be the right one.

129
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:55,920
But it's totally destroyed.

130
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:01,231
Who the hell are you?

131
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:08,112
Who are you?

132
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:14,577
Do you understand me?
- Yes.

133
02:02:17,121 --> 02:02:20,250
What are you doing here?

134
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,257
I was...

135
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:31,594
I was trying to open this tin.
- Where do you live?

136
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:39,227
Do you work here?
- No.

137
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:46,901
What's your work?

138
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:52,532
I am...

139
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:55,910
I was a pianist.

140
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,748
A pianist.

141
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:21,936
Come.

142
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,838
Play.

143
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:10,409
Are you hiding here?

144
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:17,917
Jew?

145
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:22,338
Where are you hiding?

146
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:26,676
In the attic.

147
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:31,889
Show me.

148
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:57,581
Have you anything to eat?

149
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:10,423
Jew?

150
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:27,898
Please.
What's all that gunfire?

151
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:31,444
The Russians.
On the other side of the river.

152
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:36,574
All you have to do is hang on
for a few more weeks.

153
02:14:07,164 --> 02:14:10,292
What's happening?
- We're getting out.

154
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,048
Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

155
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:22,846
I... I don't know how to thank you.

156
02:14:24,473 --> 02:14:28,978
Don't thank me. Thank God.
It's His will that we should survive.

157
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:32,731
Well. That's what we have to believe.

158
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:45,744
Here, take this one.

159
02:14:46,912 --> 02:14:50,708
What about you?
- I've got another one. Warmer.

160
02:14:55,754 --> 02:15:00,843
What will you do when it's all over?

161
02:15:01,427 --> 02:15:06,098
I'll play the piano again.
On Polish Radio.

162
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:11,145
Tell me your name.
I'll listen out for you.

163
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:13,439
Szpilman.

164
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,650
Szpilman...

165
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:20,738
Good name for a pianist.

166
02:18:32,846 --> 02:18:35,474
Musician?

167
02:18:35,557 --> 02:18:38,602
You're musician?
- Yes.

168
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:42,773
Do you happen to know another musician,
a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!

169
02:18:42,856 --> 02:18:46,527
Polish radio?
- Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.

170
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:50,697
I helped Mr Szpilman
when he was in hiding.

171
02:18:50,781 --> 02:18:56,036
Tell him I'm here.

172
02:18:56,411 --> 02:19:00,290
Ask him to help me.
- What's your name?

173
02:19:00,582 --> 02:19:03,710
Hosenfeld.
- What?

174
02:22:16,987 --> 02:22:21,658
Wladyslaw Szpilman continued to live in
Warsaw until his death on 6th July, 2000.

175
02:22:21,742 --> 02:22:24,870
He was 88 years old.

176
02:22:32,669 --> 02:22:36,798
The name of the German officer
was Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.

177
02:22:36,882 --> 02:22:41,553
All that is known is that he died
1952 in a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp.
