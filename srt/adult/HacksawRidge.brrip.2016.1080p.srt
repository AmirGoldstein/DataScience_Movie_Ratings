<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you out of here!</font>

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond. Desmond!</font>

15
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait up.
- Catch up.</font>

17
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait up, I've got something to tell you.</font>

18
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, Hal?</font>

19
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Race you to the top.</font>

20
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Cheater!</font>

21
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!</font>

22
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Want a hand?
- I got it.</font>

23
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!</font>

24
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quit it.
- You quit it.</font>

25
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Pete's sake.</font>

26
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Get away from that
ledge, you damn fool kids!</font>

27
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to break your necks!</font>

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.</font>

29
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...</font>

30
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Putting in a sidewalk...</font>

31
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You boys wouldn't recognize it now.</font>

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.</font>

33
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.</font>

34
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I died with you.</font>

35
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like we boys never existed.</font>

36
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's all I got for you today.</font>

37
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Block him with your right, Desmond.</font>

38
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Do you hear me?</font>

39
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?</font>

40
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom! Ugh!</font>

41
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why stop 'em?
Saves me whipping them both.</font>

42
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, I just whip the one that wins.</font>

43
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom!</font>

44
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

45
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

46
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?</font>

47
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell have you done?</font>

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can't hear me.</font>

49
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get some ice.</font>

50
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You shift that basket.
- I got it.</font>

51
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he breathing?</font>

52
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal? Hal, can you hear me?</font>

53
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal, can you hear me?</font>

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal... Come on.</font>

55
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dilated.</font>

56
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal...</font>

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doin'?</font>

58
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.</font>

59
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me, Desmond?</font>

60
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.</font>

61
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that gonna teach the boy?</font>

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's violent enough already.</font>

63
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, fine,
you go smother him in kisses.</font>

64
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.</font>

65
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hal's gonna be okay.</font>

66
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

67
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.</font>

68
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murder, it's the worst sin of all.</font>

69
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to take another man's life,</font>

70
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.</font>

71
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing hurts his heart so much.</font>

72
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you understand English?</font>

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to tell you again?</font>

74
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!</font>

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?</font>

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mind
your own damned business!</font>

77
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep it off, Tom.</font>

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate him.</font>

79
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma?</font>

80
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why does he hate us so much?</font>

82
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he don't hate us.</font>

83
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hates himself sometimes.</font>

84
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.</font>

85
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.</font>

86
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Praise the Lord</i></font>

87
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Praise the Lord</i></font>

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Let the people rejoice!</i></font>

89
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Oh, come</i></font>

90
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> To the Father
Through Jesus the Son</i></font>

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> And give him the glory</i></font>

92
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Great things he has done </i></font>

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd we sound, Desmond?</font>

94
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.</font>

95
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.</font>

96
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.</font>

97
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on out there? Desmond!</font>

98
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it up, get it up!</font>

99
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drag him out. Just the tarp.</font>

100
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll phone an ambulance.</font>

101
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no time. Joshua's pickup.</font>

102
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quick!
- Okay.</font>

103
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.</font>

104
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in good hands.</font>

105
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got here?</font>

106
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a severed artery.
Get some sutures.</font>

107
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, doctor.</font>

108
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?</font>

109
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.</font>

110
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might have saved this boy's life.</font>

111
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.</font>

112
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name, son?</font>

113
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gilbert.</font>

114
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.</font>

115
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.</font>

116
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel pain?</font>

117
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with us, okay?</font>

118
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.</font>

119
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.</font>

121
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you need?</font>

122
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My belt.</font>

123
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.</font>

124
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pants don't hold up
so good without it.</font>

125
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh, I don't have your belt.</font>

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I know that, ma'am.
It's out there.</font>

127
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right out there
with the boy still.</font>

128
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm just here to take blood.</font>

129
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give mine.</font>

130
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.</font>

131
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll call you.</font>

132
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That room.</font>

133
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever given blood before, Mr...</font>

134
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss.</font>

135
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.</font>

136
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.</font>

137
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may be a little dizzy
when we're done.</font>

138
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is somebody picking you up?</font>

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, ma'am. Walking back.</font>

140
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you live?</font>

141
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fort Hill, ma'am.</font>

142
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a ways.</font>

143
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just 5 or 6 miles,
but I cut through the woods.</font>

144
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 7 that way!</font>

145
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must really like the woods.</font>

146
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. I sure do.</font>

147
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, put some pressure here.</font>

148
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

150
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?</font>

151
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.</font>

152
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.</font>

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodness. Does she know that?</font>

154
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not yet. She's about to.</font>

155
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.</font>

156
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spoke to her.</font>

157
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.</font>

158
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hal!
- Come here.</font>

159
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your greasy paws off of me.</font>

160
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish me luck, Momma.</font>

161
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

162
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next.</font>

163
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?</font>

164
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. I have.</font>

165
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the belt man.</font>

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond, yes, ma'am.</font>

167
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood 2 days in a row.</font>

168
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.</font>

169
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.</font>

170
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.</font>

171
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you got to.</font>

172
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since you stuck me
with that needle,</font>

173
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my heart's been beating real fast.</font>

174
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.</font>

175
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.</font>

176
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is?</font>

177
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.</font>

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No good?</font>

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say that.</font>

180
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?</font>

181
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.</font>

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arteries spurt blood.</font>

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And veins?</font>

184
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bleed.</font>

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you need to practice</font>

186
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.</font>

187
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I probably do.</font>

188
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.</font>

189
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On dating?</font>

190
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On blood.</font>

191
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another medical question perhaps?</font>

192
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.</font>

193
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because I'm sitting in the dark.</font>

194
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're just beautiful.</font>

195
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the way!</font>

196
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to watch where you're going.</font>

197
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.</font>

198
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't ask.</font>

199
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.</font>

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming?</font>

201
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch where you're walking!</font>

202
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you say nothing to us?</font>

203
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,</font>

204
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?</font>

205
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.</font>

206
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loads of boys
from our church are going.</font>

207
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.</font>

208
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.</font>

209
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a movie star, our boy.</font>

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice uniform, good hat.</font>

211
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.</font>

212
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.</font>

213
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.</font>

215
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.</font>

216
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.</font>

217
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just hope that
when our Hal gets shot,</font>

218
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's through the front of his jacket.</font>

219
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a simple entry wound,
not much mess.</font>

220
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Artie got hit in the back,</font>

221
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.</font>

222
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrecked his uniform entirely.</font>

223
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was lucky he was dead,</font>

224
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.</font>

225
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get outta of my sight.</font>

226
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, part mountain goat?</font>

227
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,</font>

228
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or are you just going
to leave me stranded?</font>

229
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.</font>

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

231
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A kiss.</font>

232
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.</font>

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that is still my condition.</font>

234
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.</font>

235
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hold on now.</font>

236
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't gonna slap me, are you?</font>

237
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.</font>

238
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kiss me and find out.</font>

239
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

240
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to enlist.</font>

241
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.</font>

242
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.</font>

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to be a medic.</font>

244
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.</font>

245
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.</font>

246
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!</font>

247
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?</font>

248
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?</font>

249
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I wouldn't know,
you haven't asked.</font>

250
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.</font>

251
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.</font>

252
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>

253
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon as you get your first leave.</font>

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still don't like you
at this moment.</font>

255
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

256
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well, I love you.</font>

257
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>

258
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma said come see you here.</font>

259
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

260
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These 3 were my best friends.</font>

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grew up with 'em,</font>

262
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.</font>

263
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I enlisted with 'em.</font>

264
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now my friends are there,</font>

265
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.</font>

266
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.</font>

267
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy, I signed up already.</font>

268
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...</font>

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't everybody else!</font>

270
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!</font>

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the damn idiot fools we were.</font>

272
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!</font>

273
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't!</font>

274
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.</font>

275
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.</font>

276
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.</font>

277
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.</font>

278
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.</font>

279
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, there you go, thinking it all out.</font>

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?</font>

281
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.</font>

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.</font>

283
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,</font>

284
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.</font>

285
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,</font>

286
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you won't be giving no thanks to God.</font>

287
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Ready.</font>

288
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all need some air.</font>

289
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.</font>

290
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.</font>

291
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, please, step away from the bus.</font>

292
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?</font>

293
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to have this.
It's mine.</font>

294
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep it right here, where I'll be.</font>

295
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

296
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

297
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't say that about my girl.</font>

298
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What else...
- Hey. Oh.</font>

299
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Sorry, pal.</font>

300
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...means you're the person.</font>

301
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.</font>

302
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?</font>

303
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.</font>

304
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.</font>

305
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.</font>

306
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Randall Fuller.</font>

307
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond Doss.</font>

308
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.</font>

309
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because
no one else here can read.</font>

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."</font>

311
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.</font>

312
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know testicles.</font>

313
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.</font>

314
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?</font>

315
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?</font>

316
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.</font>

317
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

318
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.</font>

319
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.</font>

320
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.</font>

321
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.</font>

322
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?</font>

323
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond Doss.</font>

324
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.</font>

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.</font>

326
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- How you doing?</font>

327
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Desmond.
- Yeah.</font>

328
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.</font>

329
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

330
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.</font>

331
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pipe down, Grease, all right?</font>

332
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.</font>

333
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, the old good book, right?</font>

334
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Lucky's got a good book.</font>

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.</font>

336
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attention!</font>

337
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Line up! Move it!</font>

338
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, move it. Move it.</font>

339
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a very
strange-looking individual</font>

340
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't mind me
saying so, Private.</font>

341
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name?
- Andy Walker.</font>

342
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you been dead, son?</font>

343
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!</font>

344
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.</font>

345
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!</font>

346
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!</font>

347
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something off
in your presentation, Private.</font>

348
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't place it.</font>

349
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it your hair?</font>

350
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?</font>

351
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.</font>

352
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, of course, that's it.
The knife.</font>

353
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.</font>

354
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?</font>

355
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?</font>

356
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.</font>

357
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.</font>

358
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who threw the knife?</font>

359
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.</font>

360
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?</font>

361
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm Polish.</font>

362
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.</font>

363
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,</font>

364
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!</font>

365
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see your Indian war cry, son.</font>

366
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>

367
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Louder! Let me see it.</font>

368
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?</font>

369
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?</font>

370
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?</font>

371
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?</font>

372
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sergeant!
- Good.</font>

373
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"</font>

374
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a sign of great respect
to your people.</font>

375
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Sergeant!</font>

376
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?</font>

377
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sergeant.</font>

378
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.</font>

379
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.</font>

380
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me want to pull
an ear off, Private.</font>

381
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!</font>

382
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should be easy for you, then.</font>

383
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Corporal.
- Sergeant.</font>

384
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.</font>

385
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sergeant.</font>

386
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.</font>

387
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your foot. Higher.</font>

388
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone outside. Now! Move it.</font>

389
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said move it.</font>

390
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.</font>

391
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.</font>

392
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state</font>

393
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.</font>

394
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now move your privates, Private Parts!</font>

395
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!</font>

396
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,</font>

397
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,</font>

398
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I may then kick them!</font>

399
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Create a loop.
This is the rabbit hole.</font>

400
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,</font>

401
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!</font>

402
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good, Tex.</font>

403
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep struggling, Teach.</font>

404
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?</font>

405
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?</font>

407
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.</font>

408
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know if you don't breathe,
you'll die.</font>

409
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.</font>

410
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!</font>

411
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.</font>

412
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You strangled yourself, numb nuts!</font>

413
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.</font>

414
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.</font>

415
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?</font>

416
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!</font>

417
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.</font>

418
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!</font>

419
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.</font>

420
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me something!</font>

421
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run like you mean it!</font>

422
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!</font>

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!</font>

424
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move! Move!</font>

425
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see you work. Let's go!</font>

426
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig, dig, dig!</font>

427
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!</font>

428
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.</font>

429
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!</font>

430
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!</font>

431
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!</font>

432
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive!</font>

433
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive!</font>

434
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, are you okay?</font>

435
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!</font>

437
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!</font>

438
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!</font>

439
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hustle! Hustle!</font>

440
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your asses across that line!</font>

441
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time! Nice work, Doss!</font>

442
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a personal gift
from the United States government</font>

443
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to each and every one of you.</font>

444
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber .30, M1,</font>

445
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon</font>

446
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.</font>

447
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.</font>

448
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.</font>

449
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.</font>

450
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't point your gun forward.</font>

451
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not want to be shot today.</font>

452
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how much you are tempted.</font>

453
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the weapon by your side.</font>

454
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay attention.</font>

455
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Problem, Private Corn Stalk?</font>

456
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?</font>

457
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>

458
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.</font>

459
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.</font>

460
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.</font>

461
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't touch a gun.</font>

462
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is the problem?</font>

463
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No problem, just a mistake, sir.</font>

464
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told the Army when I joined up.</font>

465
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not possible.</font>

466
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?</font>

467
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>

468
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.</font>

469
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.</font>

470
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.</font>

471
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a C.O., sir.</font>

472
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?</font>

473
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.</font>

474
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.</font>

475
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,</font>

476
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or saluting the flag and doing my duty.</font>

477
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.</font>

478
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.</font>

479
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?</font>

480
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

481
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.</font>

482
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- All right.</font>

483
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?</font>

484
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure</font>

485
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?</font>

486
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't want to work
on Saturdays, sir.</font>

487
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.</font>

488
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.</font>

489
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?</font>

490
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,</font>

491
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.</font>

492
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Now we got that clear.</font>

493
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let me tell you my requirements.</font>

494
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.</font>

495
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as you're in this company,
under my command,</font>

496
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will obey my orders. Period.</font>

497
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.</font>

498
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.</font>

499
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismissed.</font>

500
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen!</font>

501
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.</font>

502
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.</font>

503
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He does not practice violence.</font>

504
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will not even deign
to touch a weapon.</font>

505
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.</font>

506
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,</font>

507
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.</font>

508
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.</font>

509
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.</font>

510
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is what we men fight for.</font>

511
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.</font>

512
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.</font>

513
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I will expect everyone
in this company</font>

514
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due</font>

515
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the short time he will be with us.</font>

516
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I clear?</font>

517
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sergeant.</font>

518
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'cha got there, Dessie?</font>

519
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what that is.</font>

520
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just seems kind of small.</font>

521
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's half the Bible for half the man.</font>

522
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.</font>

523
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember speaking to you.</font>

524
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?</font>

525
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

526
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if you was attacked?</font>

527
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

528
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, like that.</font>

529
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?</font>

530
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.</font>

531
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.</font>

532
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?</font>

533
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, take a poke.</font>

534
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.</font>

535
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right there.</font>

536
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit me, Doss. Go on.</font>

537
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.</font>

538
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

539
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chickenshit.</font>

540
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

541
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on here. What is this?</font>

542
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

543
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.</font>

544
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, pass it around.</font>

545
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.</font>

546
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that back.</font>

547
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

548
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

549
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Please give it back, Smitty."</font>

550
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please give it back, Smitty.</font>

551
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear voices, Desmond?</font>

552
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>

553
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?</font>

554
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'm not a crazy person.</font>

555
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?</font>

556
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm different. I know that, but...</font>

557
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.</font>

558
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.</font>

559
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lonely?</font>

560
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.</font>

561
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,</font>

562
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the one we're pretending
to have right now.</font>

563
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.</font>

564
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,</font>

565
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.</font>

566
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm trying to
understand, all right?</font>

567
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?</font>

568
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God says not to kill.</font>

569
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one of His
most important Commandments.</font>

570
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."</font>

571
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">War is a completely different
set of circumstances.</font>

572
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,</font>

573
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."</font>

574
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Satan himself we're fighting.</font>

575
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.</font>

576
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.</font>

577
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sorry,
I will not bear arms.</font>

578
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His religious views
are certainly unique,</font>

579
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.</font>

580
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?</font>

581
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

582
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,</font>

583
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,</font>

584
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.</font>

585
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.</font>

586
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you restrict him
to barracks and KP.</font>

587
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.</font>

588
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want him gone.</font>

589
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!</font>

590
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!</font>

591
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!</font>

592
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you men fail to recognize</font>

593
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!</font>

594
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.</font>

595
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will all be on KP!</font>

596
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.</font>

597
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! Let's go.</font>

598
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your heads right.</font>

599
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.</font>

600
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.</font>

601
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dogs don't know what tired is.</font>

602
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to keep going till I drop.</font>

603
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, knock it off.
Trying to sleep here.</font>

604
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.</font>

605
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell are you still here?</font>

606
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you were.</font>

607
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Doss?</font>

608
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't good for anybody.</font>

609
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure ain't what I joined up for.</font>

610
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about what you joined up for.</font>

611
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about the lives
of every man in here.</font>

612
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yours, son.
It's time to quit this.</font>

613
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.</font>

614
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Doss.</font>

615
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no shame in this.</font>

616
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

617
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...</font>

618
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't.</font>

619
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Doss.</font>

620
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?</font>

621
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>

622
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?</font>

623
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said I was attacked, Sarge.</font>

624
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what the hell
are you saying, Doss?</font>

625
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bruised half your body sleeping?</font>

626
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I sleep pretty hard.</font>

627
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright.</font>

628
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.</font>

629
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next.</font>

630
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.</font>

631
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?</font>

632
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a shot right now, Smitty?</font>

633
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.</font>

634
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.</font>

635
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At ease.</font>

636
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.</font>

637
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.</font>

638
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.</font>

639
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put in for this furlough
3 weeks ago.</font>

640
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting married this afternoon.</font>

641
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says you're not rifle qualified.</font>

642
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...</font>

643
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Stelzer's determination was...</font>

644
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,</font>

645
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."</font>

646
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.</font>

647
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty clear.</font>

648
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.</font>

649
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!</font>

650
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand Private Doss your firearm.</font>

651
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!</font>

652
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a direct order
from a company commander.</font>

653
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.</font>

654
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,</font>

655
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.</font>

656
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't, sir.</font>

657
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?</font>

658
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's been long enough.</font>

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so very sorry.</font>

660
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes men just get cold feet.</font>

661
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some men might. Not my Desmond.</font>

662
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch</font>

663
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who cares only about regulations
and not his men.</font>

664
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>

665
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe in this book
as much as any man.</font>

666
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,</font>

667
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?</font>

668
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, sir.</font>

669
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't got answers
to questions that big,</font>

670
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I also feel like
my values are under attack,</font>

671
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know why.</font>

672
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.</font>

673
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,</font>

674
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what are you gonna do?</font>

675
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit him with your Bible?</font>

676
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm prepared to give my life for my men.</font>

677
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't win wars
by giving up your life.</font>

678
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.</font>

679
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.</font>

680
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.</font>

681
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.</font>

682
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I can't convince you, maybe she can.</font>

683
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They wouldn't let me call you.</font>

684
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it wasn't your making.</font>

685
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have they done to you?</font>

686
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, I'm all right.</font>

687
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.</font>

688
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.</font>

689
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leavenworth.</font>

690
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be some other way.</font>

691
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what that could be.</font>

692
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,</font>

693
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.</font>

694
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tried.
Nobody can say you didn't.</font>

695
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who are you going to save in prison?</font>

696
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably nobody.</font>

697
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?</font>

698
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.</font>

699
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.</font>

700
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.</font>

701
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I been prideful?</font>

702
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I am prideful.</font>

703
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself</font>

704
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I don't stay true
to what I believe.</font>

705
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much less how you could live with me.</font>

706
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.</font>

707
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else</font>

708
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you didn't try to be.</font>

709
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.</font>

710
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will love you no matter what.</font>

711
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.</font>

712
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They want him to plead guilty,</i></font>

713
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i></font>

714
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.</font>

715
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i></font>

716
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and I don't see how
he can live with that.</i></font>

717
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you, Dorothy.</font>

718
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get to talk to him,</font>

719
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.</font>

720
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're praying for both of you.</i></font>

721
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will. Bye-bye.</font>

722
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i></font>

723
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i></font>

724
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i></font>

725
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You leave this room.</i></font>

726
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Tom! Put it down!</font>

727
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!</font>

728
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got that, sir.</font>

729
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I help you, sir?</font>

730
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.</font>

731
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.</font>

732
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, if you would kindly tell him</font>

733
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.</font>

734
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a very important meeting.</font>

735
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.</font>

736
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, ma'am, it's most vital.</font>

737
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, ma'am.</font>

738
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a man out there, Tom Doss.</font>

739
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss?</font>

740
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be over in a minute.</font>

741
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.</font>

742
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

743
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a hearing into
the matter of Private Desmond Doss.</font>

744
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders</font>

745
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from his commanding officer.</font>

746
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How says the defendant?</font>

747
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.</font>

748
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.</font>

749
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.</font>

750
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?</font>

751
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wish to proceed to a court-martial?</font>

752
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Ah.</font>

753
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.</font>

754
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us</font>

755
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like it's some kind of badge of honor.</font>

756
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders</font>

757
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from his commanding officer.</font>

758
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...</font>

759
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yes.</font>

760
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they still deliberating?</font>

761
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

762
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now you go take this in there.</font>

763
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.
It's strictly military personnel.</font>

764
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.</font>

765
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.</font>

766
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.</font>

767
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?</font>

768
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do you, Private?</font>

769
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?</font>

770
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,</font>

771
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to serve in a combat unit?</font>

772
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.</font>

773
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.</font>

774
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.</font>

775
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.</font>

776
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,</font>

777
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that ain't right.</font>

778
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,</font>

779
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I would just be
sitting at home safe.</font>

780
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to serve.</font>

781
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.</font>

782
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...</font>

783
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.</font>

784
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,</font>

785
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me</font>

786
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to want to put a little bit
of it back together.</font>

787
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...</font>

788
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.</font>

789
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, sir,
but nobody's allowed...</font>

790
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...</font>

791
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,</font>

792
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...</font>

793
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on out there?</font>

794
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.</font>

795
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.</font>

796
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I need to show you this.</font>

797
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.</font>

798
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.</font>

799
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that truly the way it works, sir?</font>

800
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,</font>

801
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then you're done with?</font>

802
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.</font>

803
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were at Lys?</font>

804
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.</font>

805
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twice decorated, I see.</font>

806
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

807
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take it you are the Private's father.</font>

808
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am, sir. Thomas Doss.</font>

809
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...</font>

810
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.</font>

811
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are framed in our constitution.</font>

812
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I believe in them, as he does.</font>

813
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are why I went
and fought to protect them.</font>

814
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.</font>

815
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if it wasn't for that,</font>

816
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.</font>

817
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Corporal Doss.</font>

818
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have the letter.</font>

819
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must go.</font>

820
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector</font>

821
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are protected by an Act of Congress</font>

822
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.</font>

823
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."</font>

824
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.</font>

825
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel?</font>

826
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.</font>

827
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle</font>

828
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without a single weapon
to protect yourself.</font>

829
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.</font>

830
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.</font>

831
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.</font>

832
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understand.</font>

833
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you get home,
you tell him I love him.</font>

834
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

835
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better come home to me.</font>

836
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Uncle Sam is mild</i></font>

837

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> But never get him
riled or you'll be whipped </i></font>

839
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,010

840
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, pipe down.</font>

841
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!</font>

842
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.</font>

843
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.</font>

844
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killjoy was here.</font>

845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him room.</font>

846
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear! Clear! Move aside!</font>

847
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 96th... or what's left of them.</font>

848
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the guys we're replacing.</font>

849
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Seems good to me.
- Clear.</font>

850
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- As gold.
- Clear.</font>

851
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All clear, Sarge!</font>

852
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Glover.</font>

853
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Manville, 96th.</font>

854
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been assigned to you, sir.</font>

855
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

856
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.</font>

857
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.</font>

858
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.</font>

859
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Doss?</font>

860
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there.</font>

861
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Doss?</font>

862
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Irv Schecter.</font>

863
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.</font>

864
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.</font>

865
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just come off the line?</font>

866
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like?</font>

867
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, What's it like?</font>

868
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hacksaw.</font>

869
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We climbed up 6 times.
6 times, they threw us off.</font>

870
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.</font>

871
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're animals.</font>

872
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stinking animals.</font>

873
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nips don't care if they live or die.</font>

874
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want to die.
They keep coming at you.</font>

875
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they ain't never going to give up.</font>

876
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

877
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Hey, buddy.</font>

878
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Japs
deliberately target the wounded.</font>

879
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lose all your Red Cross markings.</font>

880
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nips put a premium on shooting medics.</font>

881
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The white is a bull's-eye.</font>

882
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, I got you a new helmet.</font>

883
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One size fits all.</font>

884
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.</font>

885
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.</font>

886
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get Okinawa, we take Japan.</font>

887
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.</font>

888
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody can survive that shit.</font>

889
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but they can.</font>

890
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?</font>

891
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, there's 3...</font>

892
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...</font>

893
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all different up there.</font>

894
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All clear, Captain.</i></font>

895
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gents, move out.</font>

896
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's blood.</font>

897
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit.</font>

898
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.</font>

899
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep climbing.</font>

900
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, come on.</font>

901
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through, make way.
Out of the way.</font>

902
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brown.
- What?</font>

903
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give this to Jessop.</font>

904
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Corporal!</font>

905
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>

906
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

907
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

908
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.</font>

909
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...</font>

910
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic!</font>

911
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over here!</font>

912
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.</font>

913
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

914
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.</font>

915
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me, Jack.</font>

916
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep moving forward! Move!</font>

917
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see anything.</font>

918
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!</font>

919
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's go.</font>

920
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vito!</font>

921
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

922
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!</font>

923
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm here.</font>

924
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way!</font>

925
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hurt?</font>

926
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>

927
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I got you, Ralph.
Just breathe.</font>

928
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.</font>

929
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.</font>

930
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, I got you.
I got you. Come on.</font>

931
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.</font>

932
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not going to last a day.</font>

933
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.</font>

934
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.</font>

935
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got kids!</font>

936
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.</font>

937
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.</font>

938
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.</font>

939
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.</font>

940
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.</font>

941
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you shifted.</font>

942
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stretcher! Stretcher!</font>

943
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.</font>

944
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing wrong with you.</font>

945
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Hang on, kid.</font>

946
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.</font>

947
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move. Go, go, go!</font>

948
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's a priority.</font>

949
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got him, we got him. Here.</font>

950
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.</font>

951
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know that!</font>

952
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him down. All right? Huh?</font>

953
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.</font>

954
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.</font>

955
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic! Help! Help.</font>

956
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.</font>

957
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

958
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, Frank. Where you hit?</font>

959
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.</font>

960
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a hand here.</font>

961
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down, sir.</font>

962
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there! The bunkers.</font>

963
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see them. Better stay down, sir.</font>

964
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.</font>

965
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.</font>

966
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.</font>

967
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?</font>

968
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him, Doss. I got him.</font>

969
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.</font>

970
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

971
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You doing okay?</font>

972
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

973
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, fire!</font>

974
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down!</font>

975
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

976
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!</font>

977
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take 'em. Go. Fire!</font>

978
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover!</font>

979
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.</font>

980
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go, Smitty,
we'll cover you. Leapfrog.</font>

981
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover.</font>

982
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Satchel!</font>

983
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ghoul!
- Clear.</font>

984
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.</font>

985
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover! Cover!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

987
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover his ass.</font>

988
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic! Medic! Help me.</font>

989
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

990
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic!</font>

991
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!</font>

992
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

993
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul. Ghoul.</font>

994
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay. Where you hit?</font>

995
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a bump on the head, that's okay.</font>

996
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

997
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Andy.
- Andy what?</font>

998
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Andy Walker.</font>

999
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also known as?</font>

1000
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul.</font>

1001
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.</font>

1002
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, men. Good work.</font>

1003
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig in for the night.
We hold this spot,</font>

1004
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we mop up the rest
of the ridge tomorrow.</font>

1005
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.</font>

1006
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rotate watch every 2 hours.</font>

1007
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.</font>

1008
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And shoot anything
that don't speak English.</font>

1009
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.</font>

1010
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,</font>

1011
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it ain't safe to go out there alone.</font>

1012
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here, now!</font>

1013
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are you going, Doss?</font>

1014
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still more wounded out there, Sarge.</font>

1015
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go with him.</font>

1016
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be smart. Keep your ears down.</font>

1017
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's find a spot.</font>

1018
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.</font>

1019
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight off.</font>

1020
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.</font>

1021
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page and Unger.</font>

1022
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ralston.</font>

1023
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:18,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."</font>

1024
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?</font>

1025
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It don't help none.</font>

1026
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you got that right. Not here.</font>

1027
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, give me that.</font>

1028
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.</font>

1029
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This man is going to need some plasma.</font>

1030
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it.
- Leave him with us.</font>

1031
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You're okay now. They got you.</font>

1032
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we find a hole and dig in?</font>

1033
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds good to me.</font>

1034
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your helmet on.</font>

1035
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't going to eat them?</font>

1036
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't eat meat. Help yourself.</font>

1037
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you don't.</font>

1038
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one heck of a dame.</font>

1039
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?</font>

1040
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I do.</font>

1041
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell her that.</font>

1042
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.</font>

1043
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, until she got to know you.</font>

1044
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an asshole sometimes.</font>

1045
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes?</font>

1046
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, all right. All right.</font>

1047
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These Japs are sneaky.</font>

1048
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.</font>

1049
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell of a dream.</font>

1050
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.</font>

1051
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rifle's just there.</font>

1052
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't bite.</font>

1053
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it will.</font>

1054
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you.</font>

1055
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After what we've just been through,</font>

1056
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.</font>

1057
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never claimed to be sane.</font>

1058
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daddy's a drunk.</font>

1059
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.</font>

1060
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Made him mean.</font>

1061
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Least you knew him.</font>

1062
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...</font>

1063
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, your momma raised you?</font>

1064
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.</font>

1065
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never saw her again.</font>

1066
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned how to hate quick.</font>

1067
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.</font>

1068
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,</font>

1069
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then whip us just because it set.</font>

1070
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could take that...</font>

1071
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but when he would
do it to our momma...</font>

1072
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from me, woman!</font>

1073
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?</font>

1074
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull the damn trigger.</font>

1075
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Stop!</font>

1076
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't kill him?</font>

1077
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my heart, I did.</font>

1078
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's why I made my promise to God,</font>

1079
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't never going to
touch a gun again.</font>

1080
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.</font>

1081
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>

1082
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

1083
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move! Get your asses over here.</font>

1084
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1085
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back, fall back! Go!</font>

1086
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're coming from underground.</font>

1087
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.</font>

1088
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target is
Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.</font>

1089
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,</font>

1090
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't expect to
be here much longer!</font>

1091
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I called an artillery strike.</font>

1092
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back. Move. Move!</font>

1093
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back! Incoming!</font>

1094
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.</font>

1095
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1096
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover me.</font>

1097
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>

1098
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here, kid!</font>

1099
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, son.</font>

1100
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what to do.
Keep pressure on it.</font>

1101
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.</font>

1102
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.</font>

1103
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?</font>

1104
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.</font>

1105
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

1106
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta move right now.
Come on, come on.</font>

1107
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go! Go!</font>

1108
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change!</font>

1109
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's too many,
get the hell out of here!</font>

1110
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move!</font>

1111
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.</font>

1112
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.</font>

1113
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.</font>

1114
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Yeah.</font>

1115
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.</font>

1116
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1117
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's move. Come on.</font>

1118
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.</font>

1119
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!</font>

1120
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1121
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go.</font>

1122
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Everyone.</font>

1123
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off the ridge!</font>

1124
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it you want of me?</font>

1125
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

1126
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hear you.</font>

1127
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic, help me! Help me!</font>

1128
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

1129
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me, Lord.</font>

1130
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1131
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in good hands.
Easy does it. Easy.</font>

1132
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...6... 8...</font>

1133
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">14.</font>

1134
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get these men secured immediately.</font>

1135
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1136
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Private Ford, how many?
- 32 only came down, sir.</font>

1137
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good Lord.
- Let's go!</font>

1138
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1139
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry. It's Desmond.</font>

1140
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?</font>

1141
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.</font>

1142
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.</font>

1143
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.</font>

1144
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1145
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help. Help me.</font>

1146
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out. I got you.</font>

1147
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.</font>

1148
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.</font>

1149
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, fellas, easy.</font>

1150
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1151
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of 3. 1, 2, 3.</font>

1152
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help, medic over here!</font>

1153
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, buddy, hold it together.</font>

1154
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at the edge, Eric.</font>

1155
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just sit tight, okay?</font>

1156
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay, Eric.
You're okay, buddy.</font>

1157
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a gun, this is going to work.</font>

1158
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One for each leg, Eric.</font>

1159
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.</font>

1160
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1161
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you now, Eric.</font>

1162
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.</font>

1163
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Japs!</font>

1164
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!</font>

1165
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you. I got you. I got you.</font>

1166
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.</font>

1167
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, another one.</font>

1168
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.</font>

1169
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.</font>

1170
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.</font>

1171
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down, Jack.
I'll get you a drink.</font>

1172
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just lost our cover.</font>

1173
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're stirrin',
we got to move. Come on.</font>

1174
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time.
They just keep coming by the...</font>

1175
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.</font>

1176
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss. Doss.</font>

1177
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help. Help me.</font>

1178
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.</font>

1179
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, buddy. Let's go.</font>

1180
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.</font>

1181
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.</font>

1182
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll end up killing the rest of them.</font>

1183
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give me the reinforcements.</font>

1184
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.</font>

1185
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three battalions got wiped out today.</font>

1186
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.</font>

1187
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need them faster than that.</font>

1188
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay.</font>

1189
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
It's all right.</font>

1190
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's okay.</font>

1191
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morphine. It's good.</font>

1192
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

1193
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:05,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.</font>

1194
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Doss. Be quiet.
Be quiet. I got you.</font>

1195
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.</font>

1196
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be quiet. Just be quiet.</font>

1197
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:21,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.</font>

1198
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go. Try now. Try now.</font>

1199
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was blind!</font>

1200
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?</font>

1201
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1202
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to get out of here, okay?
Come on.</font>

1203
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Okay, we got you.</font>

1204
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got you.</font>

1205
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ted.</font>

1206
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.</font>

1207
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.</font>

1208
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Lord, help me get one more.</font>

1209
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me get one more.</font>

1210
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, help me get one more.</font>

1211
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more. Help me get one more.</font>

1212
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more. Help me get one more.</font>

1213
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more.</font>

1214
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through.</font>

1215
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell
are these guys coming from?</font>

1216
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Hacksaw.</font>

1217
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.</font>

1218
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.</font>

1219
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even lowered a couple of Japs.</font>

1220
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.</font>

1221
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, easy. All set, move out.</font>

1222
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in here.
There's Nips everywhere.</font>

1223
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.
Private Corn Stalk.</font>

1224
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are nothing
if not full of surprises.</font>

1225
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some morphine?</font>

1226
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.</font>

1227
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. There you go.</font>

1228
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let me see. Let me see.</font>

1229
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's this doing?
Okay, not bad.</font>

1230
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see.</font>

1231
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks much worse than it is.</font>

1232
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girls will still want to kiss you.</font>

1233
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sarge, you okay here for a while?</font>

1234
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, fine. Get out of here.</font>

1235
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming back.</font>

1236
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready? Let's go.
You and me, come on.</font>

1237
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain.
There's something you gotta see.</font>

1238
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.</font>

1239
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.</font>

1240
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, follow me.
He's right here.</font>

1241
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this?</font>

1242
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing, sir?</font>

1243
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Cap.</font>

1244
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain.</font>

1245
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.</font>

1246
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get down, son?</font>

1247
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doss. Howell's still up there.</font>

1248
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, Howell and Doss did this?</font>

1249
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly just Doss.</font>

1250
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.</font>

1251
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Doss, the coward.</font>

1252
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.</font>

1253
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?</font>

1254
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.</font>

1255
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm going to drag you.</font>

1256
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>

1257
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Yeah.</font>

1258
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1259
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got company.</font>

1260
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1261
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arms up.</font>

1262
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.</font>

1263
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."</font>

1264
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1265
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Uh-huh.</font>

1266
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on.</font>

1267
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.</font>

1268
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:45,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.</font>

1269
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.</font>

1270
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got him.</font>

1271
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good. That's good.</font>

1272
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, we got him.</font>

1273
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa...</font>

1274
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.</font>

1275
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.</font>

1276
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.</font>

1277
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond.</font>

1278
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, easy. Here, come on.</font>

1279
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you wounded?</font>

1280
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

1281
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

1282
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.</font>

1283
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.</font>

1284
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make some space.</font>

1285
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need someone
to come and clean up in here.</font>

1286
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Irv?</font>

1287
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:20,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.</font>

1288
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.</font>

1289
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1290
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.</font>

1291
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done more than
any other man could have done</font>

1292
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the service of his country.</font>

1293
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.</font>

1294
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope one day you can forgive me.</font>

1295
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go back up tomorrow.</font>

1296
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.</font>

1297
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.</font>

1298
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they believe so much
in how much you believe.</font>

1299
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,</font>

1300
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they want a piece of it.</font>

1301
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're not going
to go up there without you.</font>

1302
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i></font>

1303
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i></font>

1304
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:26,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?</font>

1305
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.</font>

1306
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i></font>

1307
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i></font>

1308
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go to work.</font>

1309
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down. Get down!</font>

1310
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the ground.
On the ground. Now!</font>

1311
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lay down, lay down.
I got the morphine.</font>

1312
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's get
these men out of here.</font>

1313
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:52,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...</font>

1314
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:55,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!</font>

1315
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:58,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.</font>

1316
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1317
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:19,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.</font>

1318
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold up, hold up! Desmond!</font>

1319
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desmond.</font>

1320
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was praying the whole time.</i></font>

1321
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."</font>

1322
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:29,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."</font>

1323
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I would say anyone is wrong</i></font>

1324
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i></font>

1325
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:43,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.</font>

1326
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.</font>

1327
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you are.</font>

1328
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even though I said those things to him</i></font>

1329
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i></font>

1330
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.</font>

1331
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:05,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But then, in the long run,</i></font>

1332
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:10,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i></font>

1333
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:13,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then to have him
end up saving my life</font>

1334
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was the irony of the whole thing.</font>

1335
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:21,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.</font>

1336
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.</font>

1337
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:34,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.</font>

1338
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.</font>

1339
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:42,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, he just lit up.</font>

1340
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "I thought I was blind."</font>

1341
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war</font>

1342
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:55,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.</font>
