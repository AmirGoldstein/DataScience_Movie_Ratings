00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,994
Hello, I'm Mortimer Young of
Forever Young Film Preservation.

2
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,064
First, I want to thank all of
you who sent cards and letters

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,504
expressing concern
after our plant explosion

4
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,772
outside of Wilmington,
Delaware, June of last year.

5
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:39,607
Forever Young Films will no longer employ
non-union labor, I can tell you that.

6
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,253
No casualties, no serious damage

7
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,485
outside of the loss of one
Albanian coming-of-age film,

8
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:52,858
<i>Smityu Joransik,
or Smityu Finds</i> a <i>Pebble,</i>

9
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,395
destroyed before it could be
transferred to videotape.

10
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:05,210
We're posting the original script to
our Web site, wwwforeveryoungfilms.net,

11
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,705
in the original Albanian.

12
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,145
Visit us if you can
download Sutterlin text.

13
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:17,283
That aside, thanks to the
Wilmington Fire Department,

14
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:23,056
who worked so heroically to save the
entire Ma and Pa Kettle catalog,

15
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:28,860
and a personal thanks to emergency
room doctor Nate Eisenberg.

16
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,839
I had no idea what prolonged
exposure to plant fumes

17
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,035
had been doing
to my cerebral cortex.

18
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,205
Where was I?

19
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,649
This evening's title,
The <i>Grand</i> Lebowski,

20
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,983
is one of our
greatest success stories.

21
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,286
Probably a title
few of you are familiar with,

22
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,420
it was originally produced
in the late '90s

23
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,363
by obscure PolyGram Films,

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,063
and slipped beneath the waves critically
and commercially on its first release.

25
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:12,003
It then washed hither and yon
in the corporate paroxysms

26
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:17,310
that shook filmdom during the
catastrophic period of Synergy,

27
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,116
a period which saw Hollywood
awash with money

28
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:27,080
from Japanese electronic giants,
a large Canadian liquor concern,

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,493
and the French sewage processing
conglomerate Vivendi.

30
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:38,468
Prints of the film had been languishing
in a state of almost criminal neglect.

31
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,802
Here, for instance,
is the hilarious toe scene

32
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,003
from an unrestored
copy of the film.

33
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:51,410
Now, so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes.

34
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,849
What about the toe?
Forget about the fucking toe!

35
00:02:54,474 --> 00:03:00,254
Forever Young fieldworkers fanned
out in search of undamaged reels.

36
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,794
Our international tip line

37
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,957
yielded a virtually pristine
Italian-language print

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,762
from the palazzo
of a Lombard collector.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,599
After our technicians
bathed this print

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,540
in our patented
progressive alkalide solution

41
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,841
and then subjected it
to a sonic jiggle bath,

42
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,277
look what emerged.

43
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,818
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

44
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,722
Glorious, isn't it?

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,727
Now all that was left to be done

46
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,459
was reassemble the original cast
in the Forever Young studios

47
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,127
to dub the movie
back into English.

48
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,329
Only John Goodman
was unavailable.

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:53,674
His voice was recreated by
master impressionist David Frye.

50
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:59,417
Now, so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes.

51
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,317
What about the toe?
Forget about the fucking toe!

52
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,856
Wonderful.

53
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,586
"Forget about
the fucking toe!"

54
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:13,394
By the way, did you know that in Italy
this film was released as Mr. Marijuana

55
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,455
and was quite a success?

56
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,101
Well, we hope you enjoy
The <i>Grand</i> Lebowski,

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,666
restored, rejuvenated
and still smoking.

58
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:29,545
Until we see you again, this
is Mortimer Young. Good night.
