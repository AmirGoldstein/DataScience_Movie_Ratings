3
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,536
Juice by Tappy. Juice by Tappy.

4
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:20,745
Juice by Tappy.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,249
Tappy got juice. Tappy got juice.

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,584
Whoa, Tappy.

7
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:29,629
Juice. Juice. Who wants juice?

8
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,214
Juice.

9
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,591
Juice by you. Juice by you.

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,635
Juice. Juice by you.

11
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,804
Thank you. Thank you.

12
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,347
Thank you.

13
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:41,724
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

14
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:43,059
I said, we got a winner.

15
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:45,395
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

16
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:46,604
We got a winner.

17
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,357
Our first winner is a flight attendant
from Washington, D.C.

18
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,693
Please welcome Mary Kellington.

19
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,903
Juice by Mary. Juice by Mary.

20
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:55,947
Juice by Mary.

21
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:59,492
Harold, please, not again the TV.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,953
Ma. Ma. Come on, Ma.

23
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,080
Why you have to make
such a big deal out of this, Ma?

24
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,458
You know you'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

25
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:12,338
Why you gotta make me feel
so guilty, Ma?

26
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,264
Jesus. What are you trying to do?

27
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,558
You trying to get me
to break my own mother's set?

28
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:24,809
Or break the radiator?

29
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,477
And maybe blow up the whole house Ma?

30
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,647
Is that what you're trying to do?
Your own flesh and blood, Ma.

31
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:32,734
Is that what you're trying to do?
Your own son.

32
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:38,114
Why you always gotta play games
with my head, for chrissake?

33
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,782
Harold, I wouldn't do that.

34
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,661
But the chain isn't for you.

35
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,330
It's for the robbers.

36
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,625
Then why won't you come out?

37
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:55,924
See what I mean? You see how you
always gotta upset me, Ma?

38
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:58,051
For chrissake.

39
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,940
Ma?

40
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,360
Ma.

41
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,532
Come on out. Please, Ma?

42
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,037
Screw it.

43
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,373
This isn't happening.

44
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,877
And if it should be happening,
it would be all right.

45
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:35,421
So don't worry, Seymour.

46
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,549
It'll all work out.

47
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:39,759
You'll see already.

48
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,719
In the end, it's all nice.

49
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:48,893
Shit, man.

50
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,563
That motherfucker starting
to look a little seedy, Jim.

51
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,690
What, are you particular
all of a sudden?

52
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,609
Hey, baby, I don't care
if your motherfucker growing hair

53
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,236
just as long as we get our bread.

54
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:02,073
- Just give me a hand, Ty.
- All right, man. We're out of here.

55
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,326
Look at that.

56
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:11,249
- Hello.
- Hi.

57
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,917
Whoopie fuck. The table too.

58
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,629
What do you want from me, huh?
You want me to schlep it on my back?

59
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,757
- You got it, friend.
- I ain't my leopard schlepping. Shit.

60
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,509
Such a son, a goner.

61
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:30,513
If your mother needs you
like a moose needs a hat rack.

62
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:43,735
What?

63
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,791
Shit, man.

64
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,753
This is some boss skag, baby.

65
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:03,338
I mean, dynamite.

66
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:06,090
Oh, man, it's something else.

67
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,682
You know what we need to do?

68
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,894
We need to get us a piece
of this Brody shit

69
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:20,188
cut it up, and off it.

70
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:22,148
We could double our money easy.

71
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,067
We could buy us a couple of pieces

72
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,694
and we got some whole
another shit going on.

73
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:28,112
That would be righteous.

74
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
I bet in no time at all

75
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,910
we could get a pound of pure
straight from Sal the Geep.

76
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:38,706
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
No hassles.

77
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:43,628
- How's it going, babe?
- What's up, buddy?

78
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,630
- The usual?
- Yeah, it sounds good.

79
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,491
Jesus Christ.

80
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,089
Anything else?

81
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,010
No. Nothing. I'm all right.

82
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:44,022
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Goldfarb.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Rabinowitz.

83
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,274
Although I'm not so sure
how good it is.

84
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,484
- And you?
- What can I say?

85
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:51,112
- You want your TV?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

86
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:57,118
Mrs. Goldfarb, can I ask you
a question, you won't take it personal?

87
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,664
How many years we know each other?
Who's to count?

88
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:05,460
Why don't you tell already the police?
Maybe they could talk to Harry?

89
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,378
He wouldn't be stealing
no more the TV.

90
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,131
Mr. Rabinowitz, I couldn't do that.

91
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,217
Harry's my only child.

92
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:14,219
He's all I have.

93
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,055
Thank you, Mr. Rabinowitz.

94
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:22,060
Join us in creating excellence. Juice.

95
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,273
You'll have more passion for living
than you ever imagined.

96
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:36,157
Be excited. Be, be excited.

97
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,618
- Yeah.
- Be excited. Be, be excited.

98
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,996
Change your life. Completely turn it
around. They got the juice?

99
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:45,041
- Yeah. They got the juice.
- Juice it up.

100
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:13,945
Hello. Who is it?

101
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,715
- Shit.
- Now what?

102
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,978
It will change your life.
You know how my life started out.

103
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,731
I was an overweight man,
living in a one-room apartment.

104
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,025
I didn't have the money
to feed myself anymore.

105
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,320
I had no will to live.
I'd hit my rock bottom.

106
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,488
I stopped right there. In 30 days...

107
00:09:57,656 --> 00:10:00,825
- Hello?
- Mrs. Goldfarb? Mrs. Sara Goldfarb?

108
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:01,993
Me, speaking.

109
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,996
Mrs. Goldfarb, this is Lyle Russel
from Malin & Block.

110
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,332
- I'm not interested.
- Wait, Mrs. Goldfarb.

111
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,835
I'm not selling anything. Nothing.
I just want to offer you a chance

112
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,462
to be on television.

113
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,339
- You see, Malin & Block...
- Television?

114
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:18,259
That's right, Mrs. Goldfarb.
Television. Congratulations.

115
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,554
- Look, I don't have any...
- I'm not looking for money Mrs. Goldfarb

116
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,432
I'm calling to tell you
you've already won.

117
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,186
Malin & Block discovers contestants
for most of America's television shows.

118
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,522
You've already been chosen
from a long list

119
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,525
of potential contestants,
meaning you've already won.

120
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,528
Yes, Mrs. Goldfarb.

121
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:39,697
I never thought I'd be on television.
I'm just a...

122
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:42,116
That's right. You, on television.

123
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,203
We'll be sending you all
the necessary information in the mail.

124
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,830
Goodbye, congratulations,
and take care.

125
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,666
Juice my life.

126
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,566
But I don't get it.

127
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:59,527
Why are you so hard on your folks?

128
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,696
I mean, they give you everything.

129
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:05,241
They hook you up with an apartment,
with a croaker shrink.

130
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,202
Which is fine, you know. It's great.

131
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:12,415
It's just money is never
what I really wanted from them.

132
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,626
You know?

133
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,794
That's pretty much all I have to give.

134
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,131
Why don't you get away from them?

135
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,133
How am I gonna do that?

136
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:24,802
I don't know.

137
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,638
What about your clothes?

138
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:30,391
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

139
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,644
I can't.

140
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,895
Why not?

141
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:37,106
Then when will I have time
to hang with you?

142
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:50,662
Well.

143
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,330
So where's the party?

144
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,375
When I tell you,
you're gonna jump out of the window.

145
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,464
This is a tough one.

146
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,304
I got a great diet book.

147
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,475
Hey.

148
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:24,320
They're coming.

149
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:59,689
Be excited. Be, be excited.

150
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,655
- Thanks for the tip.
- Thanks for the tip.

151
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,282
Thank you.

152
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:19,083
It was commitment, it was passion,
it was three things.

153
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:22,587
Three things that I did. Three things
that I found could change my life.

154
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,918
I thought I'd catch a little sun today.

155
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:05,088
Really? Well, in a box, you'll catch it.

156
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:06,506
Why don't you just relax

157
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,968
and think how gorgeous you'll look
with your new red hair, huh?

158
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:14,347
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

159
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:18,142
Anybody want to waste some time?

160
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,482
Angel says this is the time.
We should do it now.

161
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,985
- Shit, I'm gonna call Brody tomorrow.
- Who's Brody?

162
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,488
That's my sweet connection.
He's got some unbelievable shit.

163
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,698
Shit, righteous.

164
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,242
Look, Marion, we got this idea.

165
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,451
What is it?

166
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:38,913
If we get a piece of this stuff, we can
cut it up and double our money no problem.

167
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,833
Shit, man, then we get us
a pound of pure and retire.

168
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,501
Now, you know what that means.

169
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,711
Homeboy has it.

170
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,547
We can get off hard knocks,
and be on easy street.

171
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,756
Shit.

172
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,676
What's the catch?

173
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,679
That's a red. I mean, that's a red.

174
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:59,017
I mean, it's not a red red,
but that's a red. It's a red.

175
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:00,476
- Red?
- Yeah. It's a red.

176
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:04,230
- You're telling me that's red?
- Yeah, I'm telling you. It's a red.

177
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,899
Then what's orange?

178
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,360
If this is a red,
I want to know, what's orange?

179
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:16,576
Well, it could be...

180
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:21,539
that it's a little orange too.

181
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,502
I need to know something.

182
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:36,471
I always thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever seen.

183
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:38,473
Really?

184
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,813
Ever since I first saw you.

185
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,900
That's nice, Harry.

186
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,742
That makes me feel really good.

187
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,081
You know that other people
have told me that before.

188
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,501
And it was meaningless.

189
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,926
Why?

190
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:18,388
Because you thought
they were pulling your leg?

191
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:22,934
No, no, not like that.
I mean, I don't know.

192
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,936
I don't know or even care if they were.

193
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:28,314
It's just, from them, it was...

194
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,277
just meaningless.

195
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,570
You know?

196
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:38,908
But you say it, and I hear it.

197
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,287
I really hear it.

198
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:52,630
You know, somebody like you could
really make things all right for me.

199
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,632
You think?

200
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,470
What is that?

201
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:02,390
Remember when I told you
about the store?

202
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,017
Yeah.

203
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,895
I been thinking about it a lot and...

204
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,315
I put together some numbers and...

205
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,151
it's not impossible.

206
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:17,697
I mean, you know, you could do it.
You should do it.

207
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:21,117
I mean, we could do it together.

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,918
What do you think?

209
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,692
Stop already.

210
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:40,738
You'll feel better in the red dress
than in a cheese Danish.

211
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:20,069
Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.

212
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:22,780
- Number one.
- No red meat.

213
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:25,950
Think about it. What do they stick
in red meat? I ate red meat.

214
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:30,580
I ate red meat to the point
where I would eat it slab right off raw.

215
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,499
Loved my meat. I turned it around.

216
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,168
You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

217
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,795
No red meat.
No red meat for 30 days.

218
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:40,548
No red meat. You guys are terrific.

219
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:44,636
Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.

220
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,899
- Ada told us. It's gorgeous.
- Sara.

221
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,902
- We're gonna make it a little darker tomorrow.
- Why darker?

222
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,155
- To go with my red dress.
- But now it's looking like Madonna.

223
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,448
This is not Madonna.

224
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:08,785
And neither is this,
but soon I'm going on a diet.

225
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,496
- What diet are you on?
- Eggs and grapefruit.

226
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:14,499
- Oh, I was on that one. Lots of luck.
- It's not so bad.

227
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,960
- How long you been on it?
- All day.

228
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:21,172
All day? It's 1 O' Clock. All day.

229
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,800
- I'm thinking thin.
- She's thinking thin.

230
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:27,178
My Louise,
she lost 50 pounds just like that.

231
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:28,638
- Like that?
- Like what?

232
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:31,349
What did you do,
put her in a sweatbox?

233
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:35,144
She went to a doctor,
and he gave her pills.

234
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:38,606
- You don't want to eat.
- So? What's so good about that?

235
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:42,360
You mean I'm sitting here not thinking about
chopped liver and pastrami on rye?

236
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,655
You know, you really shouldn't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

237
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:46,865
Oh, big deal.

238
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:50,118
I'll sneak another wedge of grapefruit.

239
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,163
- I'm thinking thin.
- Oh, Sara, the mailman.

240
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:58,334
Sara Goldfarb? You have
something for Sara Goldfarb?

241
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:01,796
- I'm expecting something.
- Ms. Goldfarb. Goldfarb.

242
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:04,757
- Sara Goldfarb.
- This is it?

243
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,386
- That's it. It's here.
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my stuff.

244
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,680
- All right.
- Okay, I got the tape.

245
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:13,308
Your name. What's your name?
Put down your name.

246
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,018
S-A-R-A...

247
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:16,853
G-O-L-D...

248
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,189
F-A-R-B.

249
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:20,773
Dynamite?

250
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:26,154
Dynamite.

251
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:29,032
All right, we on our way. All right.

252
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,576
Brody's man said he got
some real fine shit, man.

253
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:34,078
All right, man.

254
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,747
Should be cool.

255
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,540
Hey, Ty?

256
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:42,212
- Let's do this right, man.
- Come on, baby. Naturally.

257
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:47,759
- Come on.
- Hurry, hurry. Let's hurry.

258
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:50,762
- I wonder when you'll hear.
- Yeah, me too.

259
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,932
- Hi.
- I want to come with you.

260
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,684
You know, maybe they'll send you
to Tavern on the Green.

261
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:58,770
You know that's where they send all those stars.

262
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:01,689
Yeah, I'm eating eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

263
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:02,899
I hope they have that.

264
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,151
- Hurry before the mailman comes.
- Here we are.

265
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,278
- Oh, God.
- Mail it.

266
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,698
Oh, it's done.

267
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,160
Oh, this is so exciting.

268
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,996
This is so exciting.

269
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:23,521
There it is, Jim.

270
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,359
There it is, baby.

271
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,112
Oh, shit.

272
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,114
Should we try?

273
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:35,450
Wait, Ty.

274
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,535
Look.

275
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,455
This is our chance to make it big.

276
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,208
We play it right...

277
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,835
and we can get a pound of pure.

278
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:48,379
But if we get wasted...

279
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,881
we'll fuck it up.

280
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,258
Right on.

281
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,719
Hey, look, I ain't trying to jive you, Jim.

282
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:58,389
I don't want to be running the streets whole life 
with my sneakers ripped up

283
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:00,725
and my nose running down
to my chin.

284
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:03,353
All I'm saying
is we should take a little taste

285
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,688
so we know how much to cut.

286
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:07,065
It's business.

287
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,236
Fair enough.

288
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,578
Shit.

289
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,347
Thank you. Three things is all I did
to change my life.

290
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,599
Thirty days is all it takes.
Three things.

291
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,226
- Number two.
- Number two.

292
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:44,769
No refined sugar.

293
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:47,272
Sugar's everywhere in sight.
Sugar's everywhere.

294
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:50,525
You know they even put sugar
in bottled water?

295
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,068
I was sick with sugar.

296
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:54,195
That was my medicine.
It nurtured me.

297
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:57,282
It nurtured my spiraling brain
that felt I was a loser.

298
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,242
- Juice by you.
- Juice by you.

299
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,830
Number two is no refined sugar.

300
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,958
Sodas? Don't even think
about sodas anymore.

301
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:10,587
No sucking candies. Very good, sir.
None of that stuff. Just stay away from it.

302
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:13,798
Check loaves of bread. Watch your
toothpaste. No refined sugar.

303
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:17,302
I said, "For 30 days,
I'm gonna eat right.

304
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,387
I am gonna pick up my spirits...

305
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,264
and I am gonna try."

306
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:23,725
I found hope.

307
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:26,269
And in that hope,
I found a way of thinking.

308
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,112
Shut up.

309
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:12,565
- Hello?
- Rosie?

310
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,108
- Yeah?
- Sara.

311
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,318
Yeah?

312
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:17,529
I need the number of that doctor.

313
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,700
I don't understand
why you gotta see him.

314
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:25,286
Cut the son of a bitch loose,
for chrissake.

315
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:26,913
Because I don't want him...

316
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,707
mentioning to my parents
that I've stopped therapy.

317
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:33,503
They're already so pissed off at me,
they're thinking of cutting me off you know...

318
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:36,965
Harry, I'm not gonna sleep with him
or anything.

319
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,176
I'm gonna come home
after the concert.

320
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:43,263
You're jealous.

321
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:46,432
Harry's jealous?

322
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,811
Oh, put your arms around me.

323
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:51,896
- No.
- Oh, you are so stubborn.

324
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,190
Put your arms around me.

325
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,069
Stop that.

326
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:01,739
I'll suck your eyeballs out.

327
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,242
Well?

328
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,705
I'm disappointed
that you're indisposed.

329
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,333
Is Anita out of town or something?

330
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,253
Why do you ask?

331
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,756
I was just wondering
if she was indisposed.

332
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,265
No. She's fine, thank you.

333
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,267
Actually, she's in Florida.

334
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,020
Can I ask you something
personal, Arnold?

335
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,354
Of course.

336
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,109
- Well.
- Anything. What?

337
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:40,778
I... You just have
something over here.

338
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,615
- It's gone?
- A little bit. Little bit lower.

339
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:48,786
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
It's much better. It's... Arnold.

340
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:53,917
So how are you, Mrs. Goldfarb?

341
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,294
How am I? Enormous.

342
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:59,714
- That's why I'm here.
- Oh, I've seen much worse.

343
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,549
Thank you.

344
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:03,551
How's your hearing and vision?

345
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,637
I have both.

346
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:09,265
The doctor will be with you shortly.

347
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,316
I see you're a little overweight.

348
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:21,819
A little? I have 50 pounds
I'm willing to donate.

349
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,905
We can take care of that.

350
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,156
No problem.

351
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,625
We're on our way, baby.

352
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:19,878
Baby, we're on our way.

353
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:23,339
God, it's great out there.
I mean, everybody is thirsty.

354
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:25,758
Come to me.

355
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,845
Harry.

356
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,222
I am so glad.

357
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:49,908
Naturally.

358
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,851
Purple in the morning...

359
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,853
blue in the afternoon...

360
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:20,730
orange in the evening.

361
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:25,276
There's my three meals,
Mr. Smarty-Pants.

362
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:28,613
And green at night.

363
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:30,949
Just like that. One, two, three, four.

364
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:44,272
Why don't you come back
to bed, baby?

365
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,565
Come on now, Alice.

366
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,775
Got plenty of time for that.

367
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:50,945
Right now I'm grooving
with these new mirrors I got.

368
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:15,887
I told you, Mom. One day I'd make it.

369
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:17,972
You don't have to make anything,
my sweet.

370
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,099
You just have to love
your mama, huh?

371
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:26,731
What you doing, baby?

372
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,566
Nothing.

373
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:33,238
Just thinking about you.

374
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:38,034
And all the nasty things
I'm about to do to you.

375
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:41,079
Get over here.

376
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,708
Ty, you scare me sometimes.

377
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:48,211
Oh, now, I don't want to scare you.

378
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:50,588
Shit, I don't want to scare nobody.

379
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,719
All I want out of life is a little bit
of peace and happiness, that's all.

380
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,347
Right now...

381
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:04,310
I'm with the finest fox
I ever laid my eyes on.

382
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,940
That's what I'll do.

383
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:11,234
For my mother, you know?

384
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:14,571
I been thinking about getting
something for her, you know, like...

385
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:16,447
Like a present or something.

386
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:18,783
But I didn't know
what I was gonna get.

387
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:20,618
- Until now.
- And?

388
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:23,079
I finally asked myself, right?

389
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:24,372
What's her fix?

390
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,625
Television, right?

391
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:30,295
I mean, if ever there's a TV junkie,
it's the old lady.

392
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:33,631
I figure I owe her a set anyway
with all the wear and tear it got

393
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:37,343
from being schlepped back and forth
to old Abe's all the time.

394
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,721
You really love her, don't you?

395
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,642
I guess so, you know?

396
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:50,231
Most of the time,
I just want her to be happy.

397
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,483
Let's go get it now.

398
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,738
Well, let's push off first.

399
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:03,620
It's early, Harry.
We shouldn't get going till tonight.

400
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:56,714
Be excited. Be, be excited.

401
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:58,299
Be excited.

402
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:00,885
You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

403
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,220
I am a living testament.

404
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:05,723
Sixty-five pounds thinner. I feel great.

405
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:07,433
Juice.

406
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:16,401
- Number three.
- Number three.

407
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,194
Number three.

408
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:23,032
This drives most people crazy.

409
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:27,912
This is easy so far...

410
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,249
but give yourself the 30 days.

411
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:36,212
I guarantee you...

412
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:24,135
I mean, that is thin.

413
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:26,763
- She doesn't look the same person.
- This is a waistline.

414
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,390
I can almost zip the dress.
The red dress?

415
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:32,310
- I've almost got the zipper up.
- Oh, Sara. The mailman.

416
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:35,396
When I see it,
I'm gonna wave it all over the place.

417
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:38,274
- Are you sure you looked?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

418
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:39,776
What did he say?

419
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,486
Don't worry, Sara. It'll come.

420
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:43,488
- He said it'll come.
- Yeah, don't worry.

421
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,782
- Two months for a package.
- Two months?

422
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:49,077
- It's Harry.
- Oh, look.

423
00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:52,121
- Harry.
- Hey, Ma, easy.

424
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:55,291
You're gonna crush me,
for chrissakes.

425
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:56,668
Come inside.

426
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:58,461
- Hello.
- Hi, Harry.

427
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:01,506
- Hello, Harry.
- We'll have a little visit.

428
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:04,342
So how are you, Harry?
You're looking so good.

429
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,678
- You want something to eat?
- No, Ma.

430
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,264
A little nosh maybe? A piece of cake?

431
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,516
I could go out and get something
if you want.

432
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:14,978
I don't have anything in the house,
but Ada would have something.

433
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:17,522
A cupcake maybe?
You want something to eat?

434
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,525
No, no, Ma. Nothing. Please, sit.

435
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,485
You're making me dizzy, for chrissake.

436
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:25,238
Yeah. You notice anything
about me, huh?

437
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:27,198
You notice I'm slimmer?

438
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:30,577
- Yeah, I guess you are, Ma.
- Twenty-five pounds I lost.

439
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,829
Twenty-five pounds.
Can you believe it?

440
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:35,915
- And that's only the beginning.
- Great, Ma. That's really great.

441
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,712
I'm really happy for you,
but will you sit? Please.

442
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:48,386
I'm Sorry I haven't been around in a while,
Ma, but I been busy. Real busy.

443
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:51,389
Oh, yeah? You got a good job?
You're doing real well?

444
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:54,684
- Yeah, real good. Real good.
- What kind of business?

445
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:59,397
Well, I'm sort of a distributor,
like, for a big importer.

446
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:01,733
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.

447
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,235
Easy. You're killing me.

448
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:07,071
Jesus, what,
have you been lifting weights?

449
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,532
- I always knew you could do that.
- Well you were right Ma.

450
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,244
Now maybe you'll meet a nice girl
and have a baby?

451
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,081
Well, I already met one.

452
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,375
Ma. Ma, Ma, Ma,
don't go ape shit, all right?

453
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:21,753
So who is she?
Who's her parents?

454
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,755
- What do they do?
- You know her. Marion.

455
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:25,089
Marion Silver? Remember?

456
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:27,300
- Oh, Silver.
- Remember? Yeah.

457
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:30,261
Of course. Manhattan Beach.

458
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,515
He's got a house on the Esplanade.
Garment business.

459
00:39:33,682 --> 00:39:35,725
Yeah. He's real big
in women's undies.

460
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:39,687
Hey, hey, before you go bouncing all
over again, and make me forget, Ma...

461
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,523
Just...

462
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,775
What I want to tell you is that...

463
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:45,443
well, I got you a present.

464
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:48,696
Oh, Harry, I don't need a present.
Just have a baby.

465
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,074
Will you let me tell you what I got you?

466
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,284
Will you, Ma?

467
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:57,497
Christ, you are really something else
today, you know that?

468
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:00,792
Look, I know...

469
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:03,419
Well...

470
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:08,132
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.

471
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,801
I want to make it up.

472
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:13,638
I mean, I know I can't change
anything that's happened...

473
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:15,974
but I want you to know that...

474
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,517
That I love you...

475
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:20,103
and that I'm sorry.

476
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:23,398
And I want you to be happy.

477
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,859
So I got you a brand-new TV set.

478
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:29,779
It's gonna be delivered in
a couple of days. It's from Macy's.

479
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:33,324
Yeah.

480
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,494
Your father would be so happy...

481
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:39,831
if he could see what you're doing
for your mother.

482
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,420
See that, Seymour?

483
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,256
You see how good your son is?

484
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:52,468
He knows what it's like for his mother,
living all alone.

485
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,596
No one to visit her.

486
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,942
Hey, Ma?

487
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:10,528
- You on uppers?
- What?

488
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:11,779
You're on uppers?

489
00:41:13,157 --> 00:41:17,076
- You're on diet pills, ain't you?
- I told you. I'm going to a specialist.

490
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,286
That's what I thought.

491
00:41:18,454 --> 00:41:20,538
You making a croaker for speed,
ain't you?

492
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,957
Harry, are you all right?
I'm going to a doctor.

493
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,419
- What does he give you, Ma? Does he give you Pills?
- Of course he gives me pills. He's a Doctor.

494
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:27,670
What kind of pills?

495
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:29,881
A purple one, a blue one,
an orange one.

496
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:31,883
I mean, like, what's in them?

497
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:35,053
Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb,
not Albert Einstein.

498
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:36,346
How should I know?

499
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:39,849
Does the stuff make you feel good,
sort of, and give you lots of pep?

500
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:42,185
Well, yeah, a little.

501
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:44,896
A little? I can hear you grinding
your teeth from here.

502
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:46,439
That goes away at night.

503
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,942
- At night?
- Yeah, when I take the green one.

504
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:51,903
Thirty minutes, I'm asleep.
Poof, just like that.

505
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:53,821
Ma, Ma.

506
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:55,448
You gotta cut that stuff loose.

507
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:58,326
- I'm telling you, it's no good.
- What do you mean, it's no good?

508
00:41:58,494 --> 00:41:59,911
Twenty-five pounds I've lost.

509
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,164
Big deal. So what? You want
to be a dope fiend, for chrissake?

510
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:06,459
What is with the dope fiend? Am I
foaming at the mouth or something?

511
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,752
He's a nice doctor.

512
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,088
I am telling you,
that croaker's no good.

513
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:11,756
How come you know so much, huh?

514
00:42:11,924 --> 00:42:14,342
How come you know more
about medicine than a doctor?

515
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:18,429
Believe me, Ma, I know.

516
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:20,056
All right?

517
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,268
You'll get strung out, for chrissake.

518
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:26,354
Come on. I almost fit in my red dress.

519
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:29,649
The one I wore
to your high-school graduation?

520
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,776
The one your father liked so much.

521
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,447
Oh, I remember how he looked at me
in that red dress.

522
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,826
Mama, what is the big deal
about the red dress?

523
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,540
I'm gonna wear it...

524
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,500
You don't know.

525
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:50,670
I'm gonna be on television.

526
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:53,464
I got a call and an application, and...

527
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:56,426
Come on, Ma. Who's pulling your leg?

528
00:42:56,594 --> 00:42:58,094
No, no, no, I'm telling you.

529
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:01,973
I'm gonna be a contestant
on television. I don't know when yet.

530
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:05,018
They haven't told me when,
but you'll see how proud you are...

531
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,270
when you see your mother
in a red dress...

532
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:09,147
television in golden shoes.

533
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:11,482
What is the big deal
about being on television?

534
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,819
Those pills you're taking will kill you
before you ever get on for chrissake.

535
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:16,529
Big deal?

536
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,781
You drove up in a cab.

537
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:21,826
Did you see who had the best seat?

538
00:43:21,994 --> 00:43:24,704
I'm somebody now, Harry.

539
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:27,123
Everybody likes me.

540
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,002
Soon, millions of people will see me

541
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,379
and they'll all like me.

542
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:35,715
I'll tell them about you

543
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:37,926
and your father.

544
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:40,261
How good he was to us.

545
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:41,846
Remember?

546
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:48,186
It's a reason to get up in the morning.

547
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:51,231
It's a reason to lose weight...

548
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,858
to fit in the red dress.

549
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:57,820
It's a reason to smile.

550
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:02,367
It makes tomorrow all right.

551
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:07,163
What have I got, Harry?

552
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:13,628
Why should I even make the bed
or wash the dishes?

553
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:17,882
I do them, but why should I?

554
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,260
I'm alone.

555
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,137
Your father's gone.

556
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:25,390
You're gone.

557
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:29,227
I got no one to...

558
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:31,896
care for.

559
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:34,732
What have I got, Harry?

560
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,573
I'm lonely.

561
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:45,577
I'm old.

562
00:44:46,078 --> 00:44:48,329
You got friends, Ma.

563
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:50,999
It's not the same.

564
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,835
They don't need me.

565
00:44:58,757 --> 00:45:01,384
I like the way I feel.

566
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:05,430
I like thinking about the red dress

567
00:45:05,598 --> 00:45:10,268
and the television
and you and your father.

568
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:15,148
Now when I get the sun, I smile.

569
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,989
I'll come and visit, Ma.

570
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:27,952
You know, now that I'm straight,
my business is going good,

571
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,039
I'll come, me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

572
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:33,124
Yeah, good. You bring her.

573
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:36,461
I'll make a mushroom soup
and a roast.

574
00:45:36,879 --> 00:45:38,922
That sounds great, Ma.

575
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:40,673
That sounds great.

576
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,134
I'll give you a call ahead of time,
all right?

577
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:44,886
Okay.

578
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:47,805
I'm glad.

579
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,559
I'm glad you have a nice girl
and your own business.

580
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:53,520
I'm glad.

581
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:01,319
I gotta go, Ma.

582
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:05,031
I got an appointment in Manhattan
in a little bit, but...

583
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,117
- But I'll be back.
- Okay. You've still got your key?

584
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:10,245
Yeah, I got it, Ma.

585
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:14,040
Bye, son.

586
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,372
Brody says you coming up quick, kid.

587
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,667
Thanks, man.

588
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:05,508
He says you're smart, you're loyal,
and you're not a junkie.

589
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:10,054
Brody wants to promote you.

590
00:47:10,222 --> 00:47:13,016
He wants to give you more
responsibility. You interested?

591
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,228
Yeah. Yeah. Shit, yeah, man.

592
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:21,357
Fuck me, I'll kill you.

593
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:24,736
- Brody says, you fuck him, I kill you.
- I got that.

594
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:26,571
Remember that.

595
00:47:30,075 --> 00:47:32,076
Shit, you got a white driver.

596
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:41,002
Fuck.

597
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:45,089
What the fuck.

598
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:56,267
Don't move.

599
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:32,762
I love you, Harry.

600
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:38,643
You make me feel like a person.

601
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:43,690
Like I'm me.

602
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:47,068
And I'm beautiful.

603
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:51,239
You are beautiful.

604
00:48:54,827 --> 00:48:58,955
You're the most beautiful girl
in the world.

605
00:48:59,874 --> 00:49:02,167
You're my dream.

606
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:11,634
No, Mrs. Goldfarb. I'm absolutely
certain. I've checked again.

607
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,345
But maybe you gave me a weaker one
last time.

608
00:49:14,513 --> 00:49:16,139
That isn't possible, Mrs. Goldfarb.

609
00:49:16,307 --> 00:49:19,017
Like I said before,
they're all the same potency.

610
00:49:19,185 --> 00:49:22,562
- But something isn't the same.
- You're just becoming adjusted to them.

611
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,357
It's nothing to worry about,
Mrs. Goldfarb, okay?

612
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,877
We got a winner.

613
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:47,795
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

614
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:50,548
She's a beautiful woman
with a winning sense of humor...

615
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:53,843
and a magical smile straight
from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

616
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:57,555
Let's give a juicy welcome
to Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

617
00:49:57,723 --> 00:49:59,432
Juice by Sara. Juice by Sara.

618
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,769
Juice by Sara. Whoa, Sara got juice.

619
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:06,397
Sara got juice. Whoa, Sara.

620
00:50:17,076 --> 00:50:18,785
Love. Love, Tyrone C.

621
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:21,246
Get your shit together. You made bail.

622
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,997
How much?

623
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:26,417
They got most of our cash,
and you're up for consorting.

624
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:28,503
Oh, shit, man.

625
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:31,464
Angel says there's a war
between the Italians and the blacks.

626
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:34,342
He says Sal the Geep
is keeping his shit down in Florida

627
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,720
- until guys like Brody are knocked off.
- Shit.

628
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,682
- No one's got a thing.
- Except Big Tim.

629
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,642
Well, shit, let's go see him.

630
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,060
He ain't selling.

631
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:45,603
He only give it up for pussy.

632
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,439
- What?
- Pussy.

633
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:50,024
He's hooked on the thing, man.

634
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:53,778
I told him I'd give him all he wants.
He said I ain't cute enough for him.

635
00:51:06,876 --> 00:51:09,127
Come on, number three.

636
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:12,088
This drives most people crazy.

637
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,174
You're gonna like it.

638
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,800
This is easy.

639
00:51:15,968 --> 00:51:18,303
In thirty days, it will. I gua...

640
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:33,735
You all right?

641
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:39,157
Yeah. It was just a bad dream.

642
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:42,035
Want some water?

643
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:06,476
- Maybe we should dip in now.
- Come on, Marion.

644
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:08,937
I already told you, all right?

645
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:12,065
It's all we have.

646
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:15,443
Tyrone is gonna score in the morning,
Harry.

647
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,869
I don't know. It's... It's a bitch out there.

648
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:28,706
It'll be okay.

649
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:32,710
It'll be okay, Harry.

650
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,217
Yeah.

651
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:40,969
I guess so.

652
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:50,019
I love you, Harry.

653
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:31,811
What seems to be the problem?
Your weight's doing fine.

654
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:35,773
The weight's fine. I'm not.

655
00:53:36,108 --> 00:53:38,776
The refrigerator.

656
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,987
Is something wrong?

657
00:53:43,908 --> 00:53:45,992
Everything's...

658
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,123
all mixed up.

659
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,292
- Confused.
- That's nothing to worry about.

660
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,752
Just get this filled.

661
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,879
Make an appointment for a week.

662
00:54:07,973 --> 00:54:09,641
Well?

663
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,101
Ty ain't found nothing yet.

664
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,939
What are we gonna do?

665
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:17,899
I don't know.

666
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:20,235
Well, you have to do
something, Harry.

667
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:22,654
I mean it's your fault that 
we don't have something for the morning.

668
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:24,447
What are you talking about?

669
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:27,242
You were all hot in the biscuit
to get off last night.

670
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:29,619
- That is such bullshit.
- You didn't have to okay.

671
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:31,871
- We could've had something.
- What was I supposed to do?

672
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,124
I'm gonna sit around and watch you
push off and not go myself?

673
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,293
Just don't put it all on me, okay?

674
00:54:48,347 --> 00:54:50,181
Don't worry, man.

675
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:52,559
We'll fill it up again.

676
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:55,019
You know, things will get better.

677
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:58,606
And then we'll be filling the box
back up, you know?

678
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:08,032
So you want to hear the news?

679
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,034
What news?

680
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,538
Well, you got your good news,
you got your bad news.

681
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:15,498
Shoot.

682
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:18,626
The good news is, a couple of days...

683
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:21,588
there's gonna be some prime
back on the street.

684
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:23,715
Really?

685
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,217
Who told you that?

686
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:29,387
- Angel.
- Yeah?

687
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,556
Yeah, he said, Sal the Geep
sent word to the street...

688
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:34,309
to let a couple of keys
go for the season.

689
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,227
You know him being a good Christian
and all...

690
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:39,230
and he don't mind feeding
during the glorious season.

691
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:42,150
- You believe it?
- Well, I did.

692
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:43,985
Until I heard the bad news.

693
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:51,576
Yeah?

694
00:55:52,077 --> 00:55:53,203
The price is double.

695
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,456
You're gonna have to cop for weight.
At least a half a piece.

696
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,916
How much?

697
00:55:59,084 --> 00:56:01,211
- Two.
- Two?

698
00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:04,088
- That's fucking insane.
- Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?

699
00:56:04,256 --> 00:56:06,925
Man ain't gonna lay no nickel bag
on you, that's for sure.

700
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:08,843
Where are we gonna get two?

701
00:56:09,678 --> 00:56:11,054
You mean Arnold?

702
00:56:12,056 --> 00:56:15,642
Well, your parents won't even return
your call.

703
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:18,394
I haven't seen him in months.

704
00:56:18,562 --> 00:56:20,355
So what, he's still calling, ain't he?

705
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,440
I don't know.

706
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:26,736
Look, I don't know what else to do.

707
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:29,239
Okay, this is our last chance
to get back on track.

708
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:33,284
We won't have to scuffle and make
the freezing scene every day.

709
00:56:35,746 --> 00:56:37,288
We need the bread.

710
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:40,625
Getting the money
is not the problem, Harry.

711
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:43,378
Well, what is the problem,
for chrissake?

712
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:46,381
I don't know what I'm gonna have to do
to get it.

713
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:55,056
Look.

714
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:56,808
Baby.

715
00:56:58,143 --> 00:57:01,271
We'll be back in business in no time.

716
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:04,315
We'll start moving again.

717
00:57:04,817 --> 00:57:07,318
We'll start saving.

718
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:13,157
It'll be perfect, just like it was.
I promise, Marion.

719
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:18,079
You'll see.

720
00:57:26,922 --> 00:57:28,965
No, I'm just...

721
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:32,385
I've had this flu forever it seems like.

722
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:35,763
Are you depressed?

723
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:38,975
No. It's nothing like that.
I've been...

724
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,810
I've been really busy.

725
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:43,730
Actually, I've been designing nonstop.

726
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:45,440
That's wonderful.

727
00:57:45,608 --> 00:57:47,442
Glad to hear you've been productive.

728
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:54,449
To be perfectly frank...

729
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:56,910
I was a little surprised
to hear from you.

730
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,207
Is there something wrong?

731
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:04,542
No. Why?

732
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,337
Well, it's usually the case...

733
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:10,798
when you get a call from someone
you haven't heard from for a while.

734
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:12,592
Everything's fine.

735
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,348
Actually.

736
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:24,395
I have a favor to ask.

737
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:33,530
You smug fuck.

738
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:35,240
What is it?

739
00:58:40,663 --> 00:58:44,666
- I need to borrow some money.
- May I ask what for?

740
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:47,877
Can you turn the light off?

741
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:50,463
What do you want the light off for?

742
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,715
I just do.

743
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:56,094
- You never did before.
- Please, Arnold.

744
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:25,373
For that special someone in your life.
I had these, which I got for my wife

745
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:28,793
and she loves it. And all her friends
are always wanting to see it.

746
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:32,755
And you know, when they hold it,
they're amazed at how heavy it is.

747
00:59:32,923 --> 00:59:35,133
It's really got some nice...

748
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:46,227
What you've always wanted.

749
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:49,355
A genuine, hand-crafted
Sapphire and diamond ring.

750
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:52,483
And you're gonna really
love the original.

751
00:59:52,651 --> 00:59:54,819
You'll want to buy one
for all of your friends.

752
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:57,322
The holidays are coming
right around the corner.

753
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:00,700
You need to make some decisions
soon before they're all gone.

754
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:03,119
Sapphire is my wife's birthstone.

755
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:29,015
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, man.

756
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:32,519
All Angel said was
meet at Walbaron's.

757
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:38,816
- You sure this is the right Walbaron's?
- Yeah, man. I'm positive. All right?

758
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:41,319
Look, will you just watch my back?

759
01:02:41,487 --> 01:02:43,780
And I'll watch yours, all right?

760
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,785
What the fuck are we supposed
to do now?

761
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:50,328
Hey.

762
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:06,177
Everyone and their mother.

763
01:03:06,345 --> 01:03:08,680
Yeah, the truck's gonna be here.
Back up.

764
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:12,851
Back up.

765
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:14,078
You ain't gotta be putting up a front.

766
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:16,998
Gun! Gun!

767
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:43,024
Stupid fucking junkie, man.
We're fucked.

768
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:45,902
- Them motherfuckers is going back.
- That was the last shit.

769
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,780
Sitting their ass in that sun
while we sit here ass deep...

770
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:50,907
in some motherfucking snow.

771
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,826
Hey.

772
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:56,621
What would happen
if we went down there to cop?

773
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:59,374
- Are you serious?
- Why not?

774
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:01,167
What the fuck are you saying?

775
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:05,046
We supposed to walk up to some motherfuckin' room clerk
at some motherfuckin' hotel and ask him for a connection?

776
01:05:05,214 --> 01:05:09,467
Get with it. You telling me that you can't
nose out some dope when it's around?

777
01:05:10,594 --> 01:05:12,804
Man, we got nothing to lose.

778
01:05:12,972 --> 01:05:15,223
It's wide open,
and if we get there right away

779
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:17,809
we can name our own price,
and we can sit back and be cool

780
01:05:17,977 --> 01:05:21,145
and have those fucking fools
scuffle the streets for us.

781
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:23,898
Yeah, man.

782
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:27,443
Last summer was
a motherfucking ball, huh, Jim?

783
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:29,153
Yeah.

784
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:35,493
It just seems like a thousand years
ago since last summer, man.

785
01:05:35,661 --> 01:05:37,662
It'll be like that again, man.

786
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,335
I can get Angel to get us a short...

787
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:47,005
if we promise him
some dynamite skag.

788
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,541
Baby.

789
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:07,126
Where have you been?

790
01:07:07,628 --> 01:07:10,380
- Where the hell you think I been huh?
- Waiting all day for you.

791
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:11,714
Where's the score?

792
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:13,716
Well, we had a little bit of a problem.

793
01:07:13,884 --> 01:07:16,803
You see,
I mean, everything was going good...

794
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:18,596
and then some dumb-ass junkie...

795
01:07:18,764 --> 01:07:20,265
Did what?

796
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:22,267
Some dumb-ass junkie did what?

797
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:23,726
You mean, you fucked it up?

798
01:07:24,103 --> 01:07:25,562
What the fuck is wrong with you?

799
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:28,106
You promised me that everything
was gonna be okay remember.

800
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:32,110
I fucked that sleazebag for you, and I
put myself through fucking hell for you.

801
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:34,612
- There's nothing out there.
- I don't give a shit.

802
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,407
You fucking loser.

803
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:42,036
You want to be sure
we have some extra stuff?

804
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:44,956
Ty told me about a guy
who's holding some weight.

805
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:47,250
But he ain't selling it.

806
01:07:48,294 --> 01:07:50,712
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ty. Give me that guy's number.

807
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,964
- What guy?
- Yeah the guy who likes broads.

808
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:54,215
Big Tim? For what?

809
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:56,593
- Just give me the fucking number for chris' sake.
- All right.

810
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,471
934-8777.

811
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:05,518
You worry so goddamn much, here,
go fix yourself up with him.

812
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:07,562
You won't have to
fucking wait around so much

813
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:11,149
and I won't have to freeze my ass off
in the fucking streets.

814
01:08:11,317 --> 01:08:12,650
Fuck you.

815
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:49,896
- All right. We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

816
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:52,023
- Oh, we got a winner.
- We got a winner.

817
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:54,692
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

818
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,403
She's a beautiful woman
with a winning sense of humor

819
01:08:57,571 --> 01:09:00,323
and a magical smile.
She's really gonna win your heart.

820
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:02,659
Straight from Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn

821
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:07,705
please give a juicy welcome
to our very own Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

822
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:09,624
Juice by Sara. Juice by Sara.

823
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,377
Juice by Sara. Whoa, Sara.

824
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,840
Whoa, Sara.

825
01:09:18,342 --> 01:09:21,010
- It's a pleasure to be here.
- It's a pleasure to have you.

826
01:09:21,178 --> 01:09:24,013
And that is one smashing dress
you have on.

827
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,687
Okay, Tappy, if you don't mind,
I would just like to say hello

828
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:32,564
to my husband Seymour

829
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:35,733
and to my beautiful, successful son,
Harry.

830
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:40,196
I hope you're in love.

831
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:41,614
Please come and see me.

832
01:09:41,782 --> 01:09:44,033
And bring Marion, won't you?

833
01:09:44,743 --> 01:09:46,244
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

834
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:50,164
It's almost that time. Are you ready?

835
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,208
I'm ready, Tappy.

836
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,005
Not to worry. Not to worry.

837
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:02,510
- 30 days to revolutionize your life.
- What are you doing there?

838
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:05,847
- Why are you here?
- Join us in creating the excitement.

839
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:07,098
What do you want?

840
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:10,602
- Oh, Tappy.
- Juice. Join us in creating excellent...

841
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:14,772
I thought you'd never ask.

842
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,316
Oh, my God.

843
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,403
Look at this.

844
01:10:21,572 --> 01:10:23,114
It's disgusting.

845
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:24,782
Well, what do you expect?

846
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:27,869
Could you do any better?

847
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:31,289
- Look at this. It's cracking.
- It's an old building.

848
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:33,833
lt hasn't been painted in years.

849
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:36,628
I'm old. Alone.

850
01:10:37,296 --> 01:10:38,880
You don't understand.

851
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:41,299
Please. I'll explain.

852
01:11:21,674 --> 01:11:25,093
What is it? What is it?
No, I don't want that.

853
01:11:25,845 --> 01:11:28,137
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

854
01:11:28,305 --> 01:11:30,306
- Ready, Mrs. Goldfarb.
- Ready for what?

855
01:11:30,474 --> 01:11:32,433
Three, two...

856
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,687
What? What am I supposed to do?

857
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:38,356
I don't know what to...

858
01:12:24,653 --> 01:12:25,737
Feed me, Sara.

859
01:12:25,905 --> 01:12:27,530
Feed me Sara.

860
01:12:27,698 --> 01:12:28,990
Feed me, Sara.

861
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:30,241
Feed me, Sara.

862
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:48,176
Feed me, Sara. Feed me, Sara.

863
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:28,132
Thank you, Angel.

864
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:32,762
I sure hope this motherfucker works,
man.

865
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:36,224
My ass could use some heat. How
long you think this trip gonna take?

866
01:13:36,392 --> 01:13:38,518
We'll make it in a day, no problem.

867
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:39,811
- A day?
- Yeah.

868
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:42,814
Shit. California, here we come.

869
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:44,983
It's Florida, Ty. Florida.

870
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,235
Shit, man. California, Florida.

871
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:50,238
Either way,
your pale ass getting a tan, man.

872
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:56,327
Do you know if this train goes
to Madison Avenue?

873
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:58,955
Do you know Malin & Block?

874
01:13:59,123 --> 01:14:02,167
I have their address.
It's on Madison Avenue.

875
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:06,087
- I'm gonna be on television.
- You're a wack.

876
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,424
Hey, hey.

877
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:13,011
Hello? Do you know if this train
Goes to Madison Avenue?

878
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:16,848
I'm gonna be on television.

879
01:14:19,143 --> 01:14:22,020
I just have to find out when.

880
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:25,064
Florida.

881
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,361
Oh, when is he gonna be back?

882
01:14:31,697 --> 01:14:33,198
A few days.

883
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:36,201
Angel, what am I supposed to do?

884
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:39,287
Angel, you gotta help me.

885
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:42,624
Oh, come on. I can get you money.

886
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:47,128
Angel, there's gotta be something.
Anything. Help me.

887
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:49,923
Why aren't you calling me?

888
01:14:50,508 --> 01:14:53,510
I have to know when I'm gonna be
on television.

889
01:14:54,762 --> 01:14:57,347
I'm Sara Goldfarb.

890
01:14:58,807 --> 01:15:02,060
And you should tell me
when I'm gonna be on television.

891
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:04,312
Just sit for a moment. I'll ring them.

892
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,566
I just wanna know when.
Maybe you lost my card.

893
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:12,195
Please, darling. You'll have a look,
and you'll tell me.

894
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:14,739
It's not the prizes.

895
01:15:14,907 --> 01:15:16,199
I'll give them away.

896
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:19,285
I just want to be on the show.

897
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:21,871
I've waited so long

898
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:24,457
to be on with my Harry

899
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,918
and my grandson.

900
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:29,337
Here, Mrs. Goldfarb. Sip this.

901
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:34,300
Sometimes it takes a while
to get called for a show, Mrs. Goldfarb.

902
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:41,266
- Is this her?
- Yes.

903
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:45,353
- Can you walk?
- I'm walking across the stage.

904
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:49,107
And you should see my Harry
on television.

905
01:15:49,275 --> 01:15:52,068
We're giving the prizes away.

906
01:15:52,236 --> 01:15:55,780
I just wanted to be on the show.

907
01:15:58,075 --> 01:16:00,827
- What's her name?
- We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

908
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:02,036
Call Seymour.

909
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,622
And tell him to meet me
at the beauty parlor.

910
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:07,458
I got the red dress that I wore
to Harry's graduation

911
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:08,793
and the gold shoes.

912
01:16:08,961 --> 01:16:11,546
Okay, Mrs. Goldfarb. Here we go.

913
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,799
One, two, three.

914
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:17,302
Let's take it nice and easy.

915
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:42,519
Yeah?

915
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:08,519
Yeah?

916
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,688
Hi.

917
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:19,739
Harold, I'm going to be on television.

918
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:48,685
Oh, shit.

919
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:51,020
Goddamn, Jimmy.
How long you had that?

920
01:17:51,856 --> 01:17:53,815
Just a few days.

921
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:55,733
That shit don't look too good.

922
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:58,194
Yeah, it don't feel
too good either, man.

923
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:03,032
But a little stuff will take care of that.

924
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,577
Hey, hey, What's wrong with you?
Don't shoot in there.

925
01:18:05,744 --> 01:18:07,495
I'll blow it if I don't.

926
01:18:08,414 --> 01:18:09,873
Fuck it.

927
01:18:22,803 --> 01:18:23,845
Shit.

928
01:18:37,943 --> 01:18:40,778
- He's gonna be surprised.
- Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?

929
01:18:40,946 --> 01:18:43,531
- Yeah, Seymour.
- Did you take anything?

930
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:46,075
I took my red dress, and...

931
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:49,037
- No emergency. Take her to Psych.
- Television.

932
01:18:59,798 --> 01:19:01,466
Come on in.

933
01:19:04,637 --> 01:19:06,221
Thanks.

934
01:19:11,477 --> 01:19:13,144
What's your name?

935
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:16,898
Marion.

936
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:18,858
Well, what do you know.

937
01:19:19,026 --> 01:19:20,985
Maid Marion.

938
01:19:27,368 --> 01:19:28,701
I'm Little John.

939
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:35,625
- You have a beautiful view.
- You know what I like best about paddy chicks?

940
01:19:38,003 --> 01:19:39,420
They give good head.

941
01:19:40,923 --> 01:19:43,341
Now, black broads don't know nothing
about no head.

942
01:19:43,509 --> 01:19:45,009
I don't know why.

943
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:48,930
Maybe it has something to do
with some ancient tribal customs.

944
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:55,186
Come here.

945
01:20:10,244 --> 01:20:12,537
Better save some of that energy.

946
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,667
Come on.

947
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:31,723
Oh, I know it's pretty, baby.

948
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,725
But I didn't take it out for air.

949
01:20:44,195 --> 01:20:45,403
Yeah.

950
01:20:51,076 --> 01:20:55,288
I told your ass,
stay away from that arm. See?

951
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:58,333
I gotta call Marion, man.

952
01:20:58,501 --> 01:21:01,669
That's about
to be a long distance call now.

953
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:03,505
That's 600 miles.

954
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:06,549
Man, we are 600 miles
closer to Miami.

955
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:09,344
Yeah, it's also 600 miles further away
from New York, Ty.

956
01:21:15,935 --> 01:21:18,061
You know, I know where you can pick up
a real nice taste.

957
01:21:18,562 --> 01:21:21,022
Though it's more like play.
Sunday night?

958
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,775
We're throwing a little gathering.
All good people.

959
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:26,903
No. I can't. I'm busy.

960
01:21:27,071 --> 01:21:29,239
Anyway, I'm not really hooked.

961
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:30,782
Oh, I know.

962
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:32,534
But it's a real nice taste.

963
01:21:38,874 --> 01:21:41,167
I'll see you Sunday, Maid Marion.

964
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:45,547
OKay Mrs. Goldfarb. Just try
and answer my questions, okay?

965
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:48,216
When did you start taking the pills?

966
01:21:49,134 --> 01:21:50,969
- The summer.
- You started in the summer.

967
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:54,681
- Last summer?
- I got the best place in the sun.

968
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:56,641
- Okay.
- Ada fixed my hair.

969
01:21:56,809 --> 01:22:01,104
Everything is gonna be all right Mrs. Goldfarb.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

970
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:25,670
- Hold tight, man. Hold tight.
- I can't cut it, man. I can't fuckin' cut it.

971
01:22:25,838 --> 01:22:27,755
I gotta do something
about this arm, Ty.

972
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:30,675
All right.
Let me see what it looks like, man.

973
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:39,184
Oh, damn, Jim.

974
01:22:40,895 --> 01:22:42,979
- Oh, man.
- That's the ugliest motherfucker

975
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:44,522
I ever seen.

976
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:47,942
- I gotta call Marion.
- Fuck that.

977
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:49,944
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

978
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:56,701
What is that?

979
01:22:57,703 --> 01:23:00,371
I don't want that. I don't want that.

980
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:19,015
God.

981
01:23:39,578 --> 01:23:40,912
What's the problem?

982
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,748
It's my arm. My arm is killing me.

983
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,083
Let's have a look at it.

984
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,756
All right.

985
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:57,011
I'll be back in a minute.

986
01:24:23,289 --> 01:24:26,833
I want to just play Blackjack all night
long. So I make up this routine.

987
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:29,085
I tell them,
"You guys go. I don't feel good.

988
01:24:29,253 --> 01:24:30,879
You guys go and have a good time."

989
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:32,922
Sure enough, they leave the room.

990
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,383
Ready. One, two, three.

991
01:24:36,969 --> 01:24:39,262
And then, as soon as they leave

992
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,765
I go running back down to the casino,
sit at my Blackjack table, man.

993
01:24:42,933 --> 01:24:44,559
I am there for the whole night.

994
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:47,437
Finally, I get up so big

995
01:24:47,605 --> 01:24:50,648
I've got $500 black chips
in my pocket.

996
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,816
I swear to God.

997
01:24:51,984 --> 01:24:55,904
The hours are going by, I'm laying
back, I'm hitting on hard 17s.

998
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:57,614
lt was beautiful.

999
01:24:57,781 --> 01:25:00,783
Next thing I know,
this guy is sitting next to me.

1000
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:03,661
He's a security guard.
He's telling me I have to leave

1001
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:08,166
like it's a nice conversation. I'm like,
"Why are you telling me to leave?"

1002
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:11,961
He says, "You have to because you've
been betting with the man next to you."

1003
01:25:12,129 --> 01:25:15,048
- And then...
- Swallow.

1004
01:25:16,509 --> 01:25:17,675
Swallow.

1005
01:25:17,843 --> 01:25:20,178
The guy is forcing me out of the room.

1006
01:25:21,847 --> 01:25:24,474
Swallow.

1007
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:34,234
Rob Smart to Kid Care.

1008
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:37,320
Rob Smart to Kid Care, please.

1009
01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:55,922
You have to eat, Mrs. Goldfarb.

1010
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,633
If we're gonna get you healthy,
you have to eat. Okay?

1011
01:25:58,801 --> 01:26:02,387
Try and work with the attendants. I'm gonna try
new medications. They should help.

1012
01:27:04,658 --> 01:27:06,075
Hello?

1013
01:27:06,243 --> 01:27:07,952
Marion?

1014
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:10,288
Harry?

1015
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,502
Marion, I've been thinking about you
so much.

1016
01:27:16,128 --> 01:27:18,046
Are you okay?

1017
01:27:20,466 --> 01:27:22,383
When are you coming home?

1018
01:27:23,302 --> 01:27:24,302
Soon.

1019
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:25,887
When?

1020
01:27:27,765 --> 01:27:28,806
Soon.

1021
01:27:30,059 --> 01:27:33,228
- You're holding out, right?
- Harry?

1022
01:27:35,898 --> 01:27:37,982
Can you come today?

1023
01:27:42,738 --> 01:27:44,364
Yeah.

1024
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,330
Yeah. I'll come.

1025
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:55,792
I'll come today.

1026
01:28:01,048 --> 01:28:03,675
You just wait for me, all right?

1027
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:10,598
- Okay, Harry.
- I'm coming back, Marion.

1028
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:12,267
- Yeah.
- Marion?

1029
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:13,518
Yeah?

1030
01:28:14,854 --> 01:28:17,355
I'm really sorry, Marion.

1031
01:28:17,523 --> 01:28:19,440
I know.

1032
01:28:28,534 --> 01:28:30,535
Mrs. Goldfarb?

1033
01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:34,122
You all right?

1034
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:41,462
So, Mrs. Goldfarb,
we've tried several medications

1035
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,548
and you don't seem
to be responding.

1036
01:28:43,716 --> 01:28:45,383
I believe we might be at a point

1037
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:48,052
where we might want to try
some alternative methods.

1038
01:28:48,804 --> 01:28:52,891
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

1039
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:57,145
So if I can just get
your John Hancock

1040
01:28:58,522 --> 01:29:00,523
we'll get underway.

1041
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:01,733
Great. Thanks.

1042
01:29:03,152 --> 01:29:06,154
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Somebody help us.

1043
01:29:06,322 --> 01:29:10,408
- I need a doctor, man.
- My friend is sick.

1044
01:29:10,576 --> 01:29:13,661
- I need some help, please. Help us.
- I can't take it, man. My arm.

1045
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:16,873
- My fucking arm.
- Just hang in fucking tight.

1046
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:20,251
- Oh, man!
- Help us!

1047
01:29:20,419 --> 01:29:23,379
Somebody fucking help us, please!

1048
01:29:43,776 --> 01:29:44,943
Maid Marion.

1049
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:46,903
Welcome.

1050
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:49,280
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1051
01:29:49,448 --> 01:29:50,782
Okay for work.

1052
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,409
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1053
01:29:53,577 --> 01:29:54,619
Okay for work.

1054
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:57,747
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:29:57,915 --> 01:29:59,082
Okay for work.

1056
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,252
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:05,713
Okay for work. Can you hear me?
Can you see me?

1058
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:07,632
- Yes, sir.
- Okay for work.

1059
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,635
- Fellows, meet Marion.
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1060
01:30:10,803 --> 01:30:12,178
Okay for work.

1061
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:15,014
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:30:15,182 --> 01:30:16,641
Okay for work.

1063
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:19,310
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:20,937
Okay for work.

1065
01:30:21,105 --> 01:30:23,106
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Showtime.

1066
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:25,191
Okay for work.

1067
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:28,152
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes.

1068
01:30:29,405 --> 01:30:32,490
Say sir. Goddamn New York,
dope-fiend niggers.

1069
01:30:33,158 --> 01:30:34,826
Learn some manners.

1070
01:30:34,994 --> 01:30:37,787
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1071
01:30:37,955 --> 01:30:40,290
- Yes, sir.
- Okay for work.

1072
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:43,585
- Mouthpiece.
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1073
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:45,795
Says he's got something wrong
with his arm.

1074
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,341
I don't think he'll be putting dope
in that arm.

1075
01:30:50,509 --> 01:30:52,010
Smells worse than he do.

1076
01:30:52,178 --> 01:30:53,219
Test.

1077
01:30:53,387 --> 01:30:56,347
Get him to the hospital.
I don't expect he'll live out the week.

1078
01:30:56,891 --> 01:31:00,643
Ready, and one.

1079
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,919
That's the trouble
with you New York dope fiends.

1080
01:31:26,086 --> 01:31:28,379
You got a rotten attitude,
you know that, man?

1081
01:31:29,381 --> 01:31:32,592
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Ass to ass.

1082
01:31:34,887 --> 01:31:36,471
Ass to ass.

1083
01:31:45,231 --> 01:31:47,315
Put your spineless back into it.

1084
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:48,900
Come on.

1085
01:31:51,028 --> 01:31:54,572
Ready, and two.

1086
01:31:57,826 --> 01:32:00,245
Ass to ass.

1087
01:32:03,249 --> 01:32:05,333
Put it in there.

1088
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:06,918
That's it.

1089
01:32:07,837 --> 01:32:10,046
Nice and easy.

1090
01:32:10,464 --> 01:32:12,423
That's the way.

1091
01:32:13,425 --> 01:32:16,094
Lose the clothes. I need one gram.

1092
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:20,098
Don't give up. Don't give up.

1093
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:22,016
Move it. Move it. Move it.

1094
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:28,273
Okay. Ready, and three.

1095
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:37,490
Cum, cum, cum.

1096
01:32:37,658 --> 01:32:40,702
We're gonna take it off at the shoulder.
Let's move it, people.

1097
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:42,912
Cum, cum, cum.

1098
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:33,838
Marion!

1099
01:33:34,006 --> 01:33:35,840
Marion?

1100
01:33:36,008 --> 01:33:37,091
It's all right.

1101
01:33:37,259 --> 01:33:39,677
Don't worry. You're in a hospital.

1102
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:41,846
- Marion?
- Who's that?

1103
01:33:42,014 --> 01:33:44,182
She'll be sent for. She'll come.

1104
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:47,852
No.

1105
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:49,687
No?

1106
01:33:51,815 --> 01:33:53,525
No, she won't.

1107
01:33:54,318 --> 01:33:55,735
She'll come.

1108
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:02,737
- All right. We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

1109
01:36:02,905 --> 01:36:07,158
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

1110
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:10,537
Our next winner
is that delightful personality

1111
01:36:10,704 --> 01:36:12,622
straight
from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

1112
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:18,294
Please give a juicy welcome
to Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

1113
01:36:19,463 --> 01:36:23,800
I'm delighted to tell you that you have
just won the grand prize.

1114
01:36:23,968 --> 01:36:25,969
Oh, no.

1115
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:28,179
Let me tell you what you've won.

1116
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:31,307
Your prize has a sweet smile
and his own private business.

1117
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:35,019
He just got engaged and is about
to get married this summer.

1118
01:36:35,187 --> 01:36:37,689
Will you please give a warm
and juicy welcome.

1119
01:36:37,857 --> 01:36:39,232
Harry Goldfarb.

1120
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,150
Juice by Harry. Juice by Harry.

1121
01:36:41,318 --> 01:36:44,195
Juice by Harry. Whoa, Harry.

1122
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:48,032
Harry got juice. Harry got juice.
Whoa, Harry.

1123
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,701
I love you, Harry.

1124
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:51,661
I love you, too, Ma.
