1
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,687
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>Historians from England
will say I am a liar,</i>

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,361
<i>but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i>

4
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,991
<i>The king of Scotland
had died without a son,</i>

5
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,701
<i>and the king of England,</i>

6
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,371
<i>a cruel pagan known
as Edward the Longshanks,</i>

7
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,541
<i>claimed the throne
of Scotland for himself.</i>

8
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,544
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him</i>

9
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,006
<i>and fought each other over the crown.</i>

10
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,177
<i>So Longshanks invited
them to talks of truce,</i>

11
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,430
<i>no weapons, one page only.</i>

12
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,604
<i>Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,</i>

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,522
<i>a commoner with his own lands.</i>

14
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,233
<i>He had two sons, John and William.</i>

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,493
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,080
Well, I finished my work.

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,247
Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,501
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

19
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,753
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

20
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,171
But I want to go.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,924
Go home, William, or you'll feel
the back of my hand.

22
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,176
Go you home, William.

23
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,785
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,291
MacAndrews!

25
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,093
Holy Jesus.

26
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,056
- It's all right!
- William! William!

27
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,186
William! William, it's all right.

28
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,688
It's all right. Easy, lad.

29
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,206
William.

30
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,211
And I say we hit back now!

31
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,088
- We cannot fight them! It's suicide!
- Something's got to be done.

32
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,883
Wallace is right! We fight them!

33
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,719
Every nobleman who had a will
to fight was at that meeting.

34
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,012
We cannot beat an army.

35
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,806
Not with 50 farmers.

36
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,100
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

37
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,686
Now, who's with me?

38
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,688
I am, Wallace.

39
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,649
All right, all right.

40
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,900
Ready.

41
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,166
Where do you think you're going?

42
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,626
I'm going with you.

43
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,920
You're going with me, are you?

44
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,340
- And what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna help.

45
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,676
And a good help you'd be, too,

46
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,597
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

47
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,099
while I'm away.

48
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,769
I can fight.

49
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,733
I know. I know you can fight.

50
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,783
But it's our wits that make us men.

51
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,290
See you tomorrow.

52
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,072
- English.
- Get down.

53
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,244
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

54
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,747
It's up to us, Hamish.

55
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,224
Nah.

56
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,480
Da?

57
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:07,988
Da?

58
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,270
William.

59
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,400
Come here, lad.

60
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,908
Amen.

61
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,702
- Amen.
- Amen.

62
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,441
William.

63
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,904
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

64
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,503
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,558
We'll stay here tonight.

66
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,977
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

67
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,937
I don't want to leave.

68
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,317
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

69
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,027
But it happened.

70
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,575
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

71
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,910
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee"?

72
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,829
It was in Latin.

73
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
You don't speak Latin?

74
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,669
Well, that's something we shall
have to remedy, isn't it?

75
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,759
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

76
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,513
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

77
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,767
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

78
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,935
and give thee peace.

79
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,313
Amen.

80
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,446
Your heart is free.

81
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,492
Have the courage to follow it.

82
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,979
What are they doing?

83
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,274
Saying goodbye in their own way.

84
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,820
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

85
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:18,167
It was the same for me and your
daddy when our father was killed.

86
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,241
First, learn to use this.

87
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:56,164
Then I'll teach you to use this.

88
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,112
<i>Many years later,</i>

89
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,157
<i>Edward the Longshanks, King of England,</i>

90
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,993
<i>supervised the wedding of his eldest son,</i>

91
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,662
<i>who would succeed him to the throne.</i>

92
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,708
Amen.

93
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,048
<i>As bride for his son,</i>

94
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,510
<i>Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival,</i>

95
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,386
<i>the King of France.</i>

96
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>It was widely whispered that
for the princess to conceive,</i>

97
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,875
<i>Longshanks would have to do
the honors himself.</i>

98
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>That may have been what
he had in mind all along.</i>

99
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,929
Scotland. My land.

100
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,561
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

101
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,647
but how will they believe our strength

102
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,858
when we cannot rule the whole
of our own island?

103
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,329
Where is my son?

104
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,000
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

105
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,836
I sent for him, and he sends you.

106
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,672
Shall I leave, milord?

107
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,468
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

108
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,597
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

109
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,181
Please.

110
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,687
Nobles.

111
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,691
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

112
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,486
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

113
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,407
give their nobles estates
here in England,

114
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,826
and make them too greedy to oppose us.

115
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,996
But, sire, our nobles will be
reluctant to uproot.

116
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,415
New lands mean new taxes,

117
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,542
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

118
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,918
Are they?

119
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,755
Are they?

120
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,944
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

121
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:23,245
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

122
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,957
Grant them <i>prima nocte.</i>

123
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,003
First night.

124
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,924
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

125
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:41,347
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

126
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,978
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

127
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,442
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland,

128
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,277
taxes or no taxes.

129
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,365
- A most excellent idea, sire.
- Is it?

130
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>Now in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

131
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,087
<i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,</i>

132
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,966
<i>a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.</i>

133
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,600
I hear that Longshanks
has granted <i>prima nocte.</i>

134
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,771
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

135
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,110
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

136
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,154
by neither supporting
his decree nor opposing it.

137
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,822
A wise plan.

138
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,116
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

139
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,035
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

140
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,418
But he sends his greetings,

141
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,464
and he says that I speak for all
of the Bruces and for Scotland.

142
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,555
It's all over now.

143
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,557
You've dropped your rock.

144
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,100
Test of manhood.

145
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,437
You win.

146
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,774
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

147
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,277
The English won't let us
train with weapons,

148
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,737
so we train with stones.

149
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,657
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

150
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,743
No. It's here.

151
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,959
Hamish?

152
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,058
Here you go, Son.

153
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,184
Show him how.

154
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,560
Come on, Hamish!

155
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,022
You'll never beat Hamish.

156
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,149
Come on there, boy!

157
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,453
My boy!

158
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,705
That's a good throw.

159
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,415
Aye. Aye, it was.

160
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,670
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.

161
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,299
As it matters in battle.

162
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,845
Could you crush a man with that throw?

163
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,431
I could crush you like a worm.

164
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,019
- You could?
- Aye.

165
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,980
Well, then, do it.

166
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,856
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?

167
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,899
Aye.

168
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,655
- Come do it.
- You'll move.

169
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,115
I will not.

170
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,200
Right.

171
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,326
He'll move.

172
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,412
Come on, Hamish.

173
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,456
Come on there, boy!

174
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,258
Well done!

175
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,274
Fine display, young Wallace.

176
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,942
Are you all right?

177
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,069
You look a wee bit shaky.

178
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,240
- I should have remembered the rocks.
- Aye, you should have.

179
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,914
Get up, you big heap.

180
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,416
It's good to see you again.

181
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,209
Aye. Welcome home.

182
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,839
- Got my head.
- Well, you should have moved.

183
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,728
William, will you dance with me?

184
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,773
Of course I will.

185
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,926
I've come to claim
the right of <i>prima nocte.</i>

186
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,180
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

187
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:43,268
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

188
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,187
By God, you will not!

189
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,026
It is my noble right.

190
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,066
Good evening, sir.

191
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,692
Young Wallace.

192
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,030
- Grand soft evening, huh?
- Aye, it's that.

193
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,784
I was wondering if I might have
a word with your daughter.

194
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,828
What do you want to have
a word with her about?

195
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,913
Well...

196
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,668
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

197
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,172
In this? You're out of your mind.

198
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,467
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

199
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,010
Slightly to the side, like.

200
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,805
- She can't go with you.
- No?

201
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,182
No the now, anyway.

202
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,226
- No the now.
- No the now?

203
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,394
We'll see you later.

204
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,521
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

205
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,982
Did you not hear what I said?

206
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,776
- Murron!
- Murron! Get...

207
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,697
It's you she takes after.

208
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,979
How did you know me after so long?

209
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,522
I didn't.

210
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,942
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

211
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,153
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

212
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,908
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

213
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,329
It was the best way to make you leave.

214
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,250
If I can ever work up
the courage to ask you again,

215
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,752
I'll send you a written warning first.

216
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,795
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

217
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,922
- Can you not?
- No.

218
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,386
Well, that's something we shall
have to remedy, isn't it?

219
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,222
- You're going to teach me to read, then?
- If you like.

220
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,100
- Aye.
- In what language?

221
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,270
You're showing off now.

222
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,357
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Why? Should I be?

223
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,202
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

224
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,579
My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

225
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,956
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

226
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,793
The French and the Romans have
far worse manners than I.

227
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,046
- You've been to Rome?
- Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

228
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,798
What was it like?

229
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,138
What does that mean?

230
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,556
Beautiful.

231
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,561
But I belong here.

232
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,680
Murron? Come in now.

233
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,296
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

234
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,380
but I assure you...

235
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,258
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

236
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,011
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

237
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,097
- What kind of meeting?
- The secret kind.

238
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,100
Your meetings are a waste of time, Campbell.

239
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,231
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

240
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,152
I know who my father was.

241
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,241
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

242
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,662
- If I can live in peace, I will.
- Go on.

243
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,705
You say you want to stay
out of the troubles?

244
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,915
Aye.

245
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,584
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

246
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,128
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

247
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,380
No?

248
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,090
No, Wallace. No.

249
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,842
- Didn't I just prove it?
- No!

250
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,761
- No?
- No!

251
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,931
Of course, running a farm's a lot of work,

252
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,976
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

253
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,062
So you've got children?

254
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,858
Not yet, but I was hoping that
you could help me with that.

255
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,527
So you want me to marry you, then?

256
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,946
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

257
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,449
Is that what you call a proposal?

258
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,328
I love you. Always have.

259
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,415
I want to marry you.

260
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,054
Is that a yes?

261
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,306
- Aye, that's a yes.
- It is?

262
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,393
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

263
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,603
- Wait.
- Where are you going?

264
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,028
- What's that?
- You'll see.

265
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,424
Father.

266
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,480
I will love you my whole life,

267
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,442
you and no other.

268
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,198
And I you,

269
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,160
you and no other, forever.

270
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,453
When am I going to see you again?

271
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,996
Tonight?

272
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,123
- I can't.
- Why not?

273
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,333
My dad's growing suspicious.

274
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,542
Growing suspicious, is he?

275
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,378
Wouldn't have anything
to do with that, would it?

276
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,213
When? When? When?

277
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,758
- When?
- Tonight.

278
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,052
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

279
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,103
Look lively, Sergeant.

280
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,157
Where are you going, lassie?

281
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,367
That looks heavy.

282
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,744
- Let me help you with it.
- No. It's fine.

283
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,247
I'm not going to steal it.

284
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,544
You remind me of my daughter back home.

285
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,641
Hello, lassie.

286
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,366
No! No!

287
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,621
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

288
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,752
You bitch!

289
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,594
You bitch!

290
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,312
Are you all right?

291
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,272
All right? Come on.

292
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,942
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

293
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,694
Are you all right?

294
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,622
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

295
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,129
Come back here, you bastard!

296
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,340
Raise the alarm!

297
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,841
Help!

298
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,594
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

299
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,971
They're getting away!

300
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,813
Go round back!

301
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,705
Get her!

302
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,917
Come on!

303
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
You bitch!

304
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,207
Murron?

305
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,049
Murron!

306
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,144
All of you know full well

307
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,646
the great pains I've always taken

308
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,068
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

309
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,946
And as a consequence,

310
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,241
have we not learned to live together

311
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,577
in relative peace and harmony?

312
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:16,047
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

313
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,808
Well, you leave me with little choice.

314
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,152
An assault on the king's soldiers

315
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,531
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

316
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,800
Now,

317
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,511
let this scrapper come to me.

318
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,975
Sir!

319
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,735
There.

320
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,609
Corporal.

321
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,070
Some archers on the tower. Now!

322
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,623
Hold still, Father.

323
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,334
You're an idiot, boy!

324
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,211
Father, you all right?

325
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,754
MacAulish.

326
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,675
MacAulish.

327
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,303
MacAulish!

328
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,474
MacAulish! MacAulish!

329
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,146
- MacAulish! MacAulish!
- Wallace! Wallace!

330
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,398
Wallace! Wallace!

331
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,776
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

332
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:01,029
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

333
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,667
What you waiting for, boy?

334
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,754
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

335
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,592
Here. You can do it.

336
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,719
I'll hold him down.

337
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,470
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

338
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,639
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

339
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,141
Indulge me.

340
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,187
Hold him. Hold him.

341
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,149
Hold him. Now let him go.

342
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,235
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,825
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

344
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,493
There's somebody coming!

345
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,370
Arm yourselves!

346
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,211
There's somebody coming.

347
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,506
MacGregors, from the next glen.

348
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,806
We heard about what was happening.

349
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,518
We don't want you <i>amadans</i> thinking
you can have your fun without us.

350
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,978
- That's right.
- Aye.

351
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,105
Go home.

352
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,192
Some of us are in this.

353
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,819
Can't help that now.

354
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,490
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

355
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,284
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

356
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,120
comes through and burns us out.

357
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,706
- And they will.
- Aye.

358
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,085
Welcome.

359
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,200
Patrol returning, milord!

360
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,730
So what news?

361
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,286
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.

362
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,621
They will be returning now!

363
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,124
Were they dressed like this?

364
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,502
Actually, it was more like 50.

365
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,087
Make it quick.

366
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,467
You remember me?

367
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,304
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

368
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,472
Your right?

369
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,308
Well, I'm here to claim
the right of a husband!

370
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,358
I am William Wallace,

371
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,447
and the rest of you will be spared.

372
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,283
Go back to England and tell them there

373
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,704
that Scotland's daughters and
her sons are yours no more.

374
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,375
Tell them Scotland is free.

375
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,716
Burn it.

376
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,232
Good job, milord.

377
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:33,046
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

378
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,382
and murdered the noble lord.

379
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,925
I heard.

380
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,719
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

381
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,931
And how would you deal with this brigand?

382
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,432
Like any common thief.

383
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:48,270
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

384
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,149
Leave us.

385
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,912
Wallace has already killed the magistrate

386
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,165
and taken control of the town.

387
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,584
Stand up.

388
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,960
Stand up.

389
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,754
In the morning,

390
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,925
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

391
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,304
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

392
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,097
Understood? Is it?

393
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,604
One day, you will be a king,

394
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,608
at least try to act like one.

395
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,113
Get away from me!

396
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,991
Convene my military council.

397
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,825
There!

398
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,955
After them.

399
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,400
No point resisting.

400
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,360
You're outnumbered and trapped.

401
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,571
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

402
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,043
Father?

403
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,129
Come in. Come in.

404
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,007
A rebellion has begun.

405
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,015
Under whom?

406
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,226
A commoner named William Wallace.

407
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,573
You will embrace this rebellion.

408
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,784
Support it from our lands in the north.

409
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,454
I will gain English favor

410
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:57,542
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

411
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,421
Sit down. Stay awhile.

412
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,472
This Wallace,

413
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,478
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

414
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,146
and he inspires.

415
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,816
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

416
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,819
So would I.

417
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,446
Well, maybe it's time.

418
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,449
It is time to survive.

419
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,535
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

420
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,958
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

421
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,797
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

422
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,048
Rightly so.

423
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,009
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

424
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,552
Just as we are.

425
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,639
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

426
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,308
Uncompromising men are easy to admire.

427
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,144
He has courage, so does a dog.

428
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,314
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

429
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,358
that makes a man noble.

430
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,652
And understand this,

431
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,321
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

432
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,116
ever to sit on the throne of England,

433
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:17,705
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

434
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,334
Give ear to our nobles.

435
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,798
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

436
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:46,109
Wait. Wait. Look.

437
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,195
- This is out, and this is left.
- Of course.

438
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,530
Carry on.

439
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,115
Carry on!

440
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:35,927
You know,

441
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,138
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

442
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,558
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

443
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,977
Shake the very ground.

444
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,688
They'll ride right over us.

445
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,315
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

446
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,819
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

447
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,489
- So what do we do?
- Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

448
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,249
We'll make spears.

449
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,918
Hundreds of them.

450
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,921
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

451
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,048
- That long?
- Aye.

452
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,260
Some men are longer than others.

453
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,680
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again.

454
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,517
Volunteers coming in!

455
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,855
William Wallace,

456
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,399
we've come to fight and to die for you.

457
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,277
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

458
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,238
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

459
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:38,364
I brought you this.

460
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,491
We checked them for arms.

461
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,244
I brought you this.

462
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,414
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

463
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,796
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

464
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,090
I'm prettier than this man.

465
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,721
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

466
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:10,021
If I risk my neck for you, will I get
a chance to kill Englishmen?

467
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:13,608
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

468
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,903
In order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

469
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,987
Yes, Father?

470
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,198
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

471
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,824
just answer the fucking question.

472
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:22,909
Mind your tongue.

473
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,452
Insane Irish.

474
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:32,293
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

475
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,254
That's my friend, Irishman,

476
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,382
and the answer to your question is yes.

477
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,385
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

478
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,053
Excellent!

479
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,263
Stephen is my name.

480
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:49,560
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

481
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,062
More's the pity.

482
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,356
Your island? You mean Ireland?

483
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,024
Yeah. It's mine.

484
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,280
You're a madman.

485
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,040
I've come to the right place, then.

486
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:34,665
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

487
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,294
I didn't like him anyway.

488
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,673
He wasn't right in the head.

489
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,230
William!

490
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,148
It's several runners!

491
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,788
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

492
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,039
Do the nobles rally?

493
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:18,501
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

494
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,919
but word has spread,

495
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,879
and the Highlanders are
coming down on their own.

496
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,258
Aye, in droves of hundreds and thousands.

497
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,010
Are you ready for a war?

498
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,111
- Well, what news?
- We're outnumbered,

499
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,362
at least three to one.

500
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,948
- How many horse, then?
- Three hundred. Maybe more.

501
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,408
Three hundred heavy horse?

502
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,828
- We must try to negotiate.
- Well, who is in command?

503
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,498
- Did he have a scarlet chevron?
- Aye, he did.

504
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,960
We can still negotiate.

505
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,674
What are they talking about?

506
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,468
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

507
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,512
The nobles will negotiate.

508
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,015
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

509
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,101
If not, we charge.

510
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,021
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

511
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,040
So many.

512
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,756
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

513
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,258
Then I'll have to work for them.

514
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,510
Nor me.

515
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,932
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

516
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,600
Let's go home!

517
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,871
Stop, men! Do not flee!

518
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,457
Wait until we've negotiated!

519
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,137
William Wallace.

520
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,306
Can't be. Not tall enough.

521
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,829
The Almighty says this must
be a fashionable fight.

522
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,664
It's drawn the finest people.

523
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,333
Where is thy salute?

524
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,212
For presenting yourselves on this
battlefield, I give you thanks.

525
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,838
This is our army.

526
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,507
To join it, you give homage.

527
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,009
I give homage to Scotland,

528
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,845
and if this is your army

529
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,515
why does it go?

530
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,309
We didn't come here to fight for them!

531
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,190
Home! The English are too many.

532
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,992
Sons of Scotland,

533
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,870
I am William Wallace.

534
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,123
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

535
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,208
Yes, I've heard.

536
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,544
He kills men by the hundreds,

537
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,296
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

538
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:19,009
with fireballs from his eyes and bolts
of lightning from his arse.

539
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,014
I am William Wallace,

540
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,687
and I see a whole army of my countrymen

541
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,481
here in defiance of tyranny.

542
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,571
You've come to fight as free men.

543
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,408
And free men you are.

544
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:48,038
What will you do with that freedom?

545
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,792
Will you fight?

546
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,837
No! No! No!

547
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,131
Fight? Against that? No!

548
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,800
We will run, and we will live.

549
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,094
Aye.

550
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,263
Fight, and you may die.

551
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,265
Run, and you'll live.

552
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,018
At least awhile.

553
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:15,649
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

554
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:22,281
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

555
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:28,162
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

556
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,706
that they may take our lives,

557
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,627
but they'll never take our freedom?

558
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,948
They seem quite optimistic to me.

559
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,199
Maybe they do want to fight.

560
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:08,869
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

561
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:12,122
but, nonetheless, I think we should
deliver the king's terms.

562
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,417
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

563
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,002
Milord, I think...

564
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,672
All right. Offer them the terms.

565
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,010
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

566
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,388
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?
- Agreed.

567
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,813
Fine speech.

568
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,606
Now what do we do?

569
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,193
Just be yourselves.

570
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,404
Where are you going?

571
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,531
I'm going to pick a fight.

572
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,541
Well, we didn't get
dressed up for nothing.

573
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,129
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

574
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,344
Here are the king's terms.

575
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,556
Lead this army off the field,

576
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,813
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

577
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,108
including hereditary title,

578
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,736
from which you will pay...

579
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,904
From which you will pay
him an annual duty...

580
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,406
I have an offer for you.

581
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,992
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

582
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,079
From which you will pay
the king an annual duty...

583
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,497
I said I have an offer for you.

584
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,249
You disrespect a banner of truce?

585
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,376
From his king? Absolutely.

586
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,629
Here are Scotland's terms.

587
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,592
Lower your flags and march
straight back to England,

588
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,303
stopping at every home you
pass by to beg forgiveness

589
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,264
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

590
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,726
Do that and your men shall live.

591
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,937
Do it not and every one
of you will die today.

592
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,988
You are outmatched.

593
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,907
You have no heavy cavalry.

594
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,326
In two centuries, no army has won...

595
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,036
I'm not finished!

596
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,332
Before we let you leave,

597
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:23,712
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

598
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,839
put his head between his legs,

599
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,800
and kiss his own arse.

600
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,979
I'd say that was rather less
cordial than he was used to.

601
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,315
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

602
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,483
On my signal,

603
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,611
ride round behind our
position and flank them.

604
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,154
We must not divide our forces.

605
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,116
Do it and let the English see you do it.

606
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,536
They'll think we run away.

607
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,414
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

608
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,040
Right. Come on.

609
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,358
Insolent bastard.

610
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,319
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

611
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,737
Archers.

612
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,490
- Archers! Archers!
- Archers!

613
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,167
- Archers, forward!
- Archers, forward!

614
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,599
You bastards!

615
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,593
Loose!

616
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,449
The Lord tells me he can
get me out of this mess,

617
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,035
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

618
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:04,850
- Ready!
- Loose!

619
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,244
Ride!

620
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,418
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

621
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:34,546
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.

622
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,131
Send the horse.

623
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,883
Full attack.

624
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,000
Steady!

625
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,795
Hold!

626
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,340
Hold!

627
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,054
Hold!

628
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,102
Hold!

629
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,117
Now!

630
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,997
Send the infantry.

631
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:16,082
- Milord...
- You lead them!

632
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:36,890
Retreat!

633
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,427
Bastard!

634
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,596
All right.

635
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,671
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

636
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,857
Wallace! Wallace!

637
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:55,195
Wallace! Wallace!

638
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,115
Wallace! Wallace!

639
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:14,214
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

640
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,012
Sir William, in the name of God,

641
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,766
we declare and appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

642
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,019
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

643
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,230
Stand and be recognized.

644
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,035
Does anyone know his politics?

645
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:47,705
No, but his weight with the commoners
could unbalance everything.

646
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:51,376
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

647
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,552
Sir William.

648
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,599
Sir William,

649
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:10,728
inasmuch as you and your
captains hail from a region

650
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,648
long known to support the Balliol clan,

651
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,568
may we invite you
to continue your support

652
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,362
and uphold our rightful claim?

653
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,364
Damn the Balliol clan!

654
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,908
They're all Longshanks' men!

655
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:28,246
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

656
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:31,166
- Now is the time to declare a king.
- Wait!

657
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:34,252
And you're prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession, I take it.

658
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,212
You're the ones who won't
support the rightful king.

659
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:38,047
Those were lies
when you first wrote them.

660
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,757
- No.
- That's the truth.

661
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,010
I demand recognition of these documents!

662
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,096
These documents were lies
when you wrote them!

663
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,392
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

664
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,102
Please, gentlemen!

665
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,980
Wait! Sir William, where are you going?

666
01:34:56,274 --> 01:35:00,778
We have beaten the English,
but they'll come back

667
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,531
because you won't stand together.

668
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,824
What will you do?

669
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,784
I will invade England

670
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:09,704
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

671
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,125
Invade? That's impossible.

672
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,627
Why?

673
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,754
Why is that impossible?

674
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:22,634
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks' table

675
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,846
that you've missed your God-given
right to something better.

676
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,390
There's a difference between us.

677
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,142
You think the people
of this country exist

678
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:33,937
to provide you with position.

679
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:38,066
I think your position exists to provide
those people with freedom,

680
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:42,111
and I go to make sure that they have it.

681
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,501
Wait!

682
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,506
I respect what you said,

683
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:05,009
but remember that these men
have lands and castles.

684
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:06,844
It's much to risk.

685
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:08,846
And the common man that
bleeds on the battlefield,

686
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:10,640
does he risk less?

687
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,813
No.

688
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:20,441
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

689
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:23,695
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

690
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,530
Its clans war with each other.

691
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,031
- Aye.
- Aye.

692
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,994
If you make enemies
on both sides of the border,

693
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,495
you'll end up dead.

694
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:35,206
We all end up dead.
It's just a question of how and why.

695
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:39,335
I'm not a coward. I want what you
want, but we need the nobles.

696
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,087
- We need them?
- Aye.

697
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,380
Nobles.

698
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:46,301
Now, tell me, what does
that mean, to be noble?

699
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,053
Your title gives you claim
to the throne of our country,

700
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:51,681
but men don't follow titles.

701
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,433
They follow courage.

702
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,393
Now, our people know you.

703
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,103
Noble and common, they respect you,

704
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,815
and if you would just
lead them to freedom,

705
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,902
they'd follow you.

706
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,614
And so would I.

707
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,055
Damn it!

708
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:35,058
My sodomite cousin the prince
tells me he has no troops to lend,

709
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,644
and every town in northern
England is begging for help.

710
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,773
- He advances!
- To which town?

711
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,608
To here, milord.

712
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,902
Bring the food and provisions inside.

713
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:48,446
Double the wall guards,
seal the gate. Now!

714
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,158
Bring in the provisions!

715
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,148
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

716
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,691
I'm not about to tell my uncle

717
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:29,112
I've lost him the greatest
city in northern England.

718
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,445
Come on!

719
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,398
Make way for the king!

720
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,409
It's not your fault.

721
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,578
Stand up to him!

722
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,289
I will stand up to him and more.

723
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,995
What news of the north?

724
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,290
Nothing new, Your Majesty.

725
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,668
We've sent riders to speed any word.

726
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,586
I heard the word in France,

727
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:54,006
where I was fighting to expand
your future kingdom.

728
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:55,925
The word, my son,

729
01:40:55,967 --> 01:41:00,137
is that our entire northern
army is annihilated,

730
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:03,933
and you have done nothing.

731
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:06,686
I have ordered conscriptions, sir.

732
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,647
They're assembled and ready to depart.

733
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,443
Excuse me, sire, but there's a very
urgent message from York.

734
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,987
Come.

735
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,414
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

736
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,336
- Wallace has sacked York.
- What?

737
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,630
Wallace has sacked York!

738
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,857
Sire, thy own nephew.

739
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:56,736
What beast could do such a thing?

740
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:00,364
If he can sack York,

741
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,161
he can invade lower England.

742
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:07,038
We would stop him!

743
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,128
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

744
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:18,633
I have declared Phillip
my high counselor.

745
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,217
Is he qualified?

746
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:24,597
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

747
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,724
Are you?

748
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,604
Then tell me, what advice would you offer

749
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:34,940
on the present situation?

750
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,932
I shall offer a truce

751
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:11,435
and buy him off.

752
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,607
But who will go to him? Not I.

753
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:23,239
If I fell under the sword of that murderer,
it might be my head in a basket.

754
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:27,785
And not my gentle son.

755
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,453
The mere sight of him

756
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:33,374
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country.

757
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,713
So whom do I send?

758
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,468
Whom do I send?

759
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,220
I'm dreaming.

760
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,347
Yes, you are.

761
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,892
And you must wake.

762
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,528
I don't want to wake.

763
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,698
I want to stay here with you.

764
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,701
And I with you,

765
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:35,329
but you must wake now.

766
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,584
Wake up, William.

767
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,294
Wake up.

768
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,549
<i>William, wake up, wake up.</i>

769
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,342
William!

770
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:52,096
A royal entourage comes,
flying banners of truce

771
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,932
and the standards of Longshanks himself!

772
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:40,978
I am the Princess of Wales.

773
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,023
I come as the king's servant
and with his authority.

774
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:46,525
To do what?

775
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,862
To discuss the king's proposals.

776
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,991
Will you speak with a woman?

777
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:17,389
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

778
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:19,683
I have been given nothing.

779
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:22,269
God makes men what they are.

780
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:25,648
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities,

781
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:29,485
the executioner of the king's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

782
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,490
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country,

783
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:37,326
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

784
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,371
even women and children,
from the city walls.

785
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,628
Longshanks did far worse the last
time he took a Scottish city.

786
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:09,775
You ask your king to his face.

787
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:11,110
Ask him.

788
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:17,032
You see if his eyes can
convince you of the truth.

789
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,917
Hamilton, leave us.

790
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:31,547
- Milady...
- Leave us. Now.

791
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,310
Let us talk plainly.

792
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:47,771
You invade England,

793
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:51,900
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

794
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:55,446
The king desires peace.

795
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:57,990
Longshanks desires peace?

796
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,576
He declares it to me. I swear it.

797
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,953
He proposes that you
withdraw your attack.

798
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:06,081
In return, he grants you title, estates,

799
01:49:06,123 --> 01:49:10,210
and this chest of gold, which I am
to pay to you personally.

800
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,296
A lordship and titles.

801
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:13,338
Gold.

802
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:15,132
That I should become Judas?

803
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:16,759
Peace is made in such ways.

804
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,094
Slaves are made in such ways!

805
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:25,559
The last time Longshanks
spoke of peace, I was a boy,

806
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:28,020
and many Scottish nobles,
who would not be slaves,

807
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,189
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

808
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:33,484
to a barn where he had them hanged.

809
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,820
I was very young,

810
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:40,365
but I remember Longshanks'
notion of peace.

811
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,914
I understand you have suffered.

812
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:50,375
I know about your woman.

813
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:03,889
She was my wife.

814
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:07,518
We married in secret

815
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:10,896
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

816
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,900
They killed her to get to me.

817
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,491
I have never spoken of it.

818
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:27,037
I don't know why I tell you now,

819
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:32,376
except I see her strength in you.

820
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,467
One day, you'll be a queen,

821
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:45,013
and you must open your eyes.

822
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:57,317
You tell your king that William
Wallace will not be ruled,

823
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:00,571
and nor will any Scot while I live.

824
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:38,609
My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

825
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,110
So he accepted our bribe?

826
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,778
No, he did not.

827
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:45,490
Then why does he stay?

828
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:48,785
My scouts tell me that he
has not advanced.

829
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,954
He waits for you at York.

830
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:53,790
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

831
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,585
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

832
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:57,920
Did he?

833
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:02,841
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

834
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:07,012
arriving so far around his flank.

835
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:11,767
The main force of our armies
from France will land here

836
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,810
to the north of Edinburgh.

837
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:19,691
Conscripts from Ireland will approach
from the southwest to here.

838
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:23,487
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

839
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,907
Even if you dispatch them today,
they'd take weeks to assemble.

840
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,619
I dispatched them before I sent your wife.

841
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,834
So our little ruse succeeded.

842
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,920
Thank you.

843
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:43,840
And while this upstart awaits
my arrival in York,

844
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:47,678
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

845
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:55,435
You spoke with this Wallace in private.

846
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:57,854
Tell me,

847
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,566
what kind of man is he?

848
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,861
A mindless barbarian.

849
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,282
Not a king like you, milord.

850
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:12,953
You may return to your embroidery.

851
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,539
Humbly, milord.

852
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:18,292
You brought back the money, of course.

853
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:26,466
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

854
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,638
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

855
01:53:33,515 --> 01:53:35,225
Forgive me, sire.

856
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:39,354
I thought that generosity might
demonstrate your greatness

857
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,732
to those you mean to rule.

858
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:47,779
My greatness will be better demonstrated

859
01:53:47,863 --> 01:53:53,243
when Wallace returns to Scotland
and finds his country in ashes.

860
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,458
William!

861
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,543
There's riders approaching!

862
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,803
Personal escort of the princess.

863
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:13,388
Aye.

864
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,433
Must have made an impression.

865
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,393
Aye.

866
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:21,438
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

867
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:26,610
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

868
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:59,643
It's true! English ships are
moving up from the south!

869
01:54:59,684 --> 01:55:02,813
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed!

870
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:05,941
I had to see it with me own
eyes before I could believe it.

871
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:08,318
What the hell are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

872
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:10,112
I wouldn't worry about them.

873
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:14,324
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

874
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:17,994
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

875
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,746
- Order it.
- Aye.

876
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,295
- Your island?
- My island! Yup!

877
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,048
You want to negotiate?

878
01:55:30,132 --> 01:55:31,508
No, please, gentlemen!

879
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,969
Lords, Craig is right!

880
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:37,180
This time, our only option is to negotiate.

881
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:40,767
Now, unless you want to see
Edinburgh razed to the ground...

882
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,569
My army has marched for more
days than I can remember

883
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:52,487
and we still have preparations to make,

884
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:54,698
so I'll make this plain.

885
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:58,368
We require every soldier you can summon.

886
01:55:58,452 --> 01:56:01,371
Your personal escorts, even yourselves,

887
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,623
and we need them now.

888
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,545
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

889
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,213
Other options?

890
01:56:11,715 --> 01:56:15,635
Don't you wish at least to lead
your men onto the field

891
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,096
and barter a better deal with Longshanks

892
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,973
before you tuck tail and run?

893
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,933
- Sir William...
- We can't defeat this army!

894
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:23,810
- We can! And we will!
- Sir William!

895
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:30,108
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!

896
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,821
We won at York, and you
would not support us.

897
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:39,284
If you'll not stand up with us now,
then I say you're cowards.

898
01:56:44,915 --> 01:56:48,752
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

899
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:52,297
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

900
01:56:54,508 --> 01:56:55,967
I beg you.

901
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:02,015
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

902
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:05,894
but fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

903
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,896
It's well beyond rage.

904
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:11,441
Help me.

905
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:16,279
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

906
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:18,281
Now is our chance. Now.

907
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,450
If we join, we can win.

908
01:57:20,534 --> 01:57:24,663
If we win, well, then we'll have what
none of us have ever had before.

909
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,123
A country of our own.

910
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:31,503
You're the rightful leader,

911
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,630
and there is strength in you. I see it.

912
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:40,470
Unite us.

913
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,141
Unite us!

914
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:47,102
Unite the clans.

915
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,859
All right.

916
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:56,444
Right.

917
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,535
This cannot be the way.

918
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:08,665
You said yourself, the nobles
will not support Wallace.

919
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:14,504
So how does it help us to join
the side that is slaughtered?

920
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,340
I gave him my word.

921
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:27,517
I know it is hard.

922
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:30,020
Being a leader is.

923
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:32,647
Now, Son...

924
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:36,484
Son, look at me.

925
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:45,869
I cannot be king.

926
01:58:46,745 --> 01:58:49,831
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

927
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:53,043
What I tell you, you must do.

928
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:55,754
Not for me, not for yourself,

929
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:57,839
for your country.

930
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,315
Lads, make way.

931
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:16,566
Coming through you.

932
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:25,241
Make way, lads.

933
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:26,826
Make...

934
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:33,124
The Bruce is not coming, William.

935
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,585
He'll come.

936
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:39,047
Mornay and Lochlan have come,

937
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:42,509
so will the Bruce.

938
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:49,265
Quite a lovely gathering.

939
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,185
Wouldn't you agree?

940
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:57,148
The archers are ready, sire.

941
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:58,858
Not the archers.

942
01:59:58,942 --> 02:00:00,985
My scouts tell me their
archers are miles away

943
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,445
and no threat to us.

944
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:06,950
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.

945
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:10,120
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

946
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,621
Infantry!

947
02:00:11,996 --> 02:00:13,415
- Infantry!
- Infantry!

948
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:14,666
Cavalry!

949
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,209
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

950
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:18,002
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

951
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,838
Advance!

952
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:22,257
- Advance!
- Advance!

953
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:49,552
- Good to see you this morning!
- Hi. How are you?

954
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:53,348
Irish.

955
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:54,641
Glad to have you with us.

956
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:56,142
Watch this.

957
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:09,150
Mornay? Lochlan?

958
02:04:09,192 --> 02:04:11,903
I gave Mornay double
his lands in Scotland

959
02:04:11,986 --> 02:04:14,197
with matching estates in England.

960
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,700
Lochlan turned for much less.

961
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:19,744
Archers.

962
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:21,245
I beg pardon, sire.

963
02:04:21,329 --> 02:04:23,539
Won't we hit our own troops?

964
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:27,043
Yes,

965
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:29,212
but we'll hit theirs as well.

966
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:30,922
We have reserves.

967
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:33,841
Attack.

968
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:36,219
Archers!

969
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:39,222
- Archers.
- Archers.

970
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:45,228
Loose!

971
02:04:51,985 --> 02:04:53,611
Loose!

972
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:16,551
Send in our reinforcements.

973
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,553
Send in the rest!

974
02:05:29,022 --> 02:05:30,732
Bring me Wallace.

975
02:05:31,566 --> 02:05:32,775
Alive, if possible.

976
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,111
Dead, just as good.

977
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:38,448
Send us news of our victory.

978
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:40,533
Shall we retire?

979
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,828
Protect the king.

980
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:11,827
Get up!

981
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:14,163
Get up!

982
02:09:15,665 --> 02:09:16,916
Up!

983
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:18,334
Get up!

984
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:20,711
- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!

985
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,551
Go!

986
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,071
I'm dying.

987
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:34,243
Let me be.

988
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:41,250
No.

989
02:10:42,626 --> 02:10:44,587
You're going to live.

990
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:49,383
I've lived long enough to live free.

991
02:10:49,925 --> 02:10:54,138
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

992
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:01,771
I'm a happy man.

993
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:53,883
I'm the one who's rotting,

994
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:57,803
but I think your face
looks graver than mine.

995
02:13:02,057 --> 02:13:03,601
Son,

996
02:13:09,648 --> 02:13:13,277
we must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

997
02:13:14,195 --> 02:13:16,238
You achieved that.

998
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:20,075
You saved your family,
increased your land.

999
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:24,788
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1000
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:31,253
Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.

1001
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:34,632
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

1002
02:13:35,966 --> 02:13:37,426
Men fight for me

1003
02:13:38,052 --> 02:13:40,429
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

1004
02:13:40,513 --> 02:13:43,766
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1005
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:48,979
Those men who bled
the ground red at Falkirk,

1006
02:13:50,481 --> 02:13:51,607
they fought for William Wallace,

1007
02:13:51,649 --> 02:13:55,444
and he fights for something
that I've never had.

1008
02:13:58,447 --> 02:14:00,824
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1009
02:14:00,908 --> 02:14:04,370
and I saw it in his face on the battlefield,

1010
02:14:04,453 --> 02:14:06,539
and it's tearing me apart!

1011
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:10,334
All men betray, all lose heart.

1012
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:13,212
I don't want to lose heart!

1013
02:14:17,216 --> 02:14:20,761
I want to believe, as he does.

1014
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:30,646
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1015
02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:22,323
No, please!

1016
02:15:48,057 --> 02:15:49,725
There he is! After him!

1017
02:16:19,046 --> 02:16:22,257
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1018
02:16:22,341 --> 02:16:23,467
Aye.

1019
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,471
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1020
02:16:27,554 --> 02:16:30,557
More a liability now than ever he was.

1021
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,435
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1022
02:16:35,479 --> 02:16:37,106
Maybe you.

1023
02:16:39,233 --> 02:16:40,818
Maybe me.

1024
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,117
It doesn't matter.

1025
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:52,913
- I'm serious, Robert.
- So am I!

1026
02:17:06,135 --> 02:17:08,303
Christ! Shit!

1027
02:17:08,387 --> 02:17:11,140
Search the place!

1028
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,643
Lochlan.

1029
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:24,153
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1030
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:26,822
Fifty if it was one.

1031
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:30,242
A hundred men with his own sword.

1032
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:31,827
Cut through them like...

1033
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:35,164
Moses through the Red Sea.

1034
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:11,283
His legend grows.
It will be worse than before.

1035
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:14,620
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1036
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,080
and when he replenishes his numbers...

1037
02:18:17,164 --> 02:18:19,792
They're sheep, mere sheep!

1038
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:25,422
Easily dispersed if we
strike the shepherd.

1039
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:27,341
Very well.

1040
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:32,721
Pick a flock of your finest
assassins and set a meeting.

1041
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:36,809
Milord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

1042
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,399
If what Lord Hamilton
tells me is correct,

1043
02:18:44,733 --> 02:18:48,278
he warmed to our future
queen and would trust her.

1044
02:18:49,947 --> 02:18:53,617
So we'll dispatch her with the notion
that she comes in peace.

1045
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:56,578
Milord, the princess
might be taken hostage

1046
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:58,705
or her life be put in jeopardy.

1047
02:18:58,747 --> 02:19:02,376
My son would be most distressed by that.

1048
02:19:03,418 --> 02:19:06,547
But in truth, if she were to be killed,

1049
02:19:07,172 --> 02:19:11,927
we would soon find the king of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1050
02:19:14,429 --> 02:19:17,808
You see, as king,

1051
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:21,061
you must find the good in any situation.

1052
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:50,424
It's William Wallace, sure.

1053
02:19:51,216 --> 02:19:54,094
He's given up his sword.

1054
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:55,762
Be ready.

1055
02:21:34,695 --> 02:21:36,196
Milady,

1056
02:21:40,075 --> 02:21:42,160
I received your message.

1057
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:59,136
This is the second time you
have warned me of danger.

1058
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:02,848
Why?

1059
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:05,100
There will be a new shipment of supplies

1060
02:22:05,142 --> 02:22:08,270
coming north next month.
Foods and weapons. They won't...

1061
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:10,272
No, stop.

1062
02:22:12,607 --> 02:22:14,401
Why do you help me?

1063
02:22:20,824 --> 02:22:22,659
Why do you help me?

1064
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:27,122
Because of the way you
are looking at me now.

1065
02:24:19,317 --> 02:24:24,865
Just when we thought all hope was lost,
our noble saviors have arrived.

1066
02:24:27,576 --> 02:24:30,078
Off with their hoods.

1067
02:24:34,249 --> 02:24:37,002
Sir William, we've come
to seek a meeting.

1068
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:40,255
Well, what's the point?

1069
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,632
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1070
02:24:42,716 --> 02:24:45,093
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1071
02:24:45,135 --> 02:24:47,762
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1072
02:24:47,846 --> 02:24:50,307
So let the council swear publicly.

1073
02:24:50,390 --> 02:24:53,768
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1074
02:24:53,852 --> 02:24:56,938
Others think you'll pay
them Mornay's wages.

1075
02:24:56,980 --> 02:24:58,732
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1076
02:24:58,773 --> 02:24:59,774
Meet us two days from now.

1077
02:24:59,858 --> 02:25:02,444
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1078
02:25:02,527 --> 02:25:03,695
Scotland will be one.

1079
02:25:03,778 --> 02:25:07,574
- One? You mean us and you.
- No.

1080
02:25:09,284 --> 02:25:11,119
I mean this.

1081
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:15,707
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1082
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:27,677
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1083
02:25:27,802 --> 02:25:31,473
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it already at Falkirk.

1084
02:25:31,514 --> 02:25:34,226
- Aye.
- I know. I saw.

1085
02:25:34,309 --> 02:25:37,062
Leaving him aside, what about the others?

1086
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,481
Nest of scheming bastards!

1087
02:25:39,522 --> 02:25:41,483
They couldn't even agree
on the color of shite!

1088
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:42,984
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1089
02:25:43,026 --> 02:25:44,402
Look at us.

1090
02:25:45,904 --> 02:25:49,324
We've got to try.
We can't do this alone.

1091
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,744
Joining the nobles is the only
hope for our people.

1092
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:54,329
You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1093
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:55,497
What?

1094
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:57,457
Nothing.

1095
02:25:59,292 --> 02:26:01,419
I don't want to be a martyr.

1096
02:26:01,878 --> 02:26:03,838
Nor I. I want to live.

1097
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,884
I want a home and children and peace.

1098
02:26:07,968 --> 02:26:09,844
- Do you?
- Aye, I do.

1099
02:26:09,928 --> 02:26:12,222
I've asked God for those things.

1100
02:26:12,847 --> 02:26:14,683
It's all for nothing if you
don't have freedom.

1101
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:17,686
- That's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

1102
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:23,024
Then what have we been
doing all this time?

1103
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,110
We've lived that dream.

1104
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:28,863
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

1105
02:26:28,947 --> 02:26:31,866
You're doing this to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1106
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:34,869
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1107
02:26:35,704 --> 02:26:38,039
And your father sees you, too.

1108
02:26:47,924 --> 02:26:49,092
Jesus.

1109
02:26:51,386 --> 02:26:53,555
Get up. Give us your hand.

1110
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:58,768
Shall I come with you?

1111
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:02,397
No. I'll go alone.

1112
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:06,192
I'll see you after.

1113
02:27:07,068 --> 02:27:08,236
Right.

1114
02:27:12,615 --> 02:27:15,118
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1115
02:27:21,458 --> 02:27:23,752
- He won't come.
- He will.

1116
02:27:24,919 --> 02:27:26,504
I know he will.

1117
02:27:40,643 --> 02:27:42,520
Milord, he approaches!

1118
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:28,191
No!

1119
02:28:32,821 --> 02:28:34,781
Stay out of it, Robert!

1120
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,743
You lied! You lied!

1121
02:28:42,122 --> 02:28:45,500
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1122
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:54,926
Father!

1123
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:03,810
You rotting bastard!

1124
02:29:04,352 --> 02:29:06,312
Why? Why?

1125
02:29:10,984 --> 02:29:13,820
Longshanks required Wallace.

1126
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,030
So did our nobles.

1127
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:19,701
That was the price of your crown.

1128
02:29:19,742 --> 02:29:20,869
Die!

1129
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,414
I want you to die!

1130
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:28,877
Soon enough, I'll be dead
and you'll be king.

1131
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:31,296
I don't want anything from you.

1132
02:29:31,838 --> 02:29:33,465
You're not a man!

1133
02:29:34,299 --> 02:29:36,384
And you're not my father.

1134
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:45,101
You're my son, and you have
always known my mind.

1135
02:29:47,187 --> 02:29:48,480
You deceived me.

1136
02:29:48,563 --> 02:29:51,065
You let yourself be deceived.

1137
02:29:51,149 --> 02:29:54,694
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1138
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,868
At last, you know what it means to hate.

1139
02:30:06,247 --> 02:30:08,500
Now you're ready to be a king.

1140
02:30:10,418 --> 02:30:14,547
My hate will die with you.

1141
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:21,513
William Wallace,

1142
02:30:21,596 --> 02:30:24,307
you stand in taint of high treason.

1143
02:30:25,308 --> 02:30:26,601
Against whom?

1144
02:30:26,643 --> 02:30:28,353
Against your king.

1145
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:31,773
Have you anything to say?

1146
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:34,734
Never in my whole life

1147
02:30:36,402 --> 02:30:38,696
did I swear allegiance to him.

1148
02:30:39,948 --> 02:30:42,825
It matters not. He is your king.

1149
02:30:45,703 --> 02:30:48,623
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1150
02:30:49,582 --> 02:30:52,335
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

1151
02:30:52,418 --> 02:30:54,003
Do you confess?

1152
02:30:56,297 --> 02:30:59,384
Do you confess?

1153
02:31:05,265 --> 02:31:08,810
Then on the morrow,
you shall receive your purification.

1154
02:31:20,989 --> 02:31:22,699
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1155
02:31:22,782 --> 02:31:24,158
We've got orders
from the king that nobody...

1156
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:26,578
The king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling.

1157
02:31:26,661 --> 02:31:29,163
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1158
02:31:29,205 --> 02:31:30,999
Now open this door.

1159
02:31:32,959 --> 02:31:34,252
Majesty.

1160
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:42,969
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1161
02:31:43,011 --> 02:31:44,429
Stop it!

1162
02:31:45,263 --> 02:31:46,598
Leave me.

1163
02:31:47,473 --> 02:31:49,142
I said leave me!

1164
02:32:02,238 --> 02:32:03,573
Milady.

1165
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:09,078
Sir, I come to beg you

1166
02:32:11,122 --> 02:32:13,583
to confess all and swear
allegiance to the king

1167
02:32:13,666 --> 02:32:15,877
that he might show you mercy.

1168
02:32:16,753 --> 02:32:19,213
Will he show mercy to my country?

1169
02:32:20,006 --> 02:32:24,344
Mercy is to die quickly,
perhaps even live in a tower.

1170
02:32:24,385 --> 02:32:26,888
In time, who knows what can happen

1171
02:32:28,514 --> 02:32:30,725
if you can only live.

1172
02:32:35,188 --> 02:32:37,023
If I swear to him,

1173
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:40,985
then all that I am is dead already.

1174
02:32:50,411 --> 02:32:52,997
You will die. It will be awful.

1175
02:32:53,081 --> 02:32:55,083
Every man dies.

1176
02:32:57,752 --> 02:32:59,879
Not every man really lives.

1177
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:07,720
Drink this.

1178
02:33:09,055 --> 02:33:11,265
It will dull your pain.

1179
02:33:11,349 --> 02:33:15,228
No. It will numb my wits,
and I must have them all.

1180
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:18,773
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1181
02:33:19,273 --> 02:33:21,984
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1182
02:33:22,068 --> 02:33:24,946
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1183
02:33:25,488 --> 02:33:26,781
Take it.

1184
02:33:31,619 --> 02:33:33,287
All right.

1185
02:34:20,668 --> 02:34:25,173
I have come to beg for the life
of William Wallace.

1186
02:34:27,467 --> 02:34:29,927
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1187
02:34:30,428 --> 02:34:32,096
I respect him.

1188
02:34:33,765 --> 02:34:35,558
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1189
02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:40,480
Show mercy, O thou great king,
and win the respect of your own people.

1190
02:34:50,114 --> 02:34:55,036
Even now, you are incapable of mercy.

1191
02:35:01,834 --> 02:35:03,336
And you...

1192
02:35:07,507 --> 02:35:10,635
To you,
that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1193
02:35:11,344 --> 02:35:15,765
Before he lost his powers of speech,
he told me his one comfort was

1194
02:35:15,848 --> 02:35:18,935
that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1195
02:35:37,286 --> 02:35:38,704
You see,

1196
02:35:40,623 --> 02:35:43,125
death comes to us all.

1197
02:35:52,552 --> 02:35:58,057
But before it comes to you, know this.

1198
02:35:58,099 --> 02:36:00,226
Your blood dies with you.

1199
02:36:02,895 --> 02:36:06,107
A child who is not of your
line grows in my belly.

1200
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:13,072
Your son will not sit long
on the throne, I swear it.

1201
02:36:50,818 --> 02:36:52,820
I'm so afraid.

1202
02:37:00,828 --> 02:37:04,707
Give me the strength to die well.

1203
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:30,650
Here he comes!

1204
02:38:59,655 --> 02:39:02,658
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1205
02:39:09,457 --> 02:39:11,792
You will fall to your knees now,

1206
02:39:13,711 --> 02:39:16,630
declare yourself the king's loyal subject

1207
02:39:17,465 --> 02:39:19,467
and beg his mercy.

1208
02:39:26,474 --> 02:39:28,350
And you shall have it.

1209
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:41,238
Rope!

1210
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,720
Stretch him!

1211
02:40:07,014 --> 02:40:10,184
That's it! Stretch him!

1212
02:40:25,908 --> 02:40:27,827
Shame! Shame!

1213
02:40:47,638 --> 02:40:49,849
Pleasant, yes?

1214
02:40:52,893 --> 02:40:54,812
Rise to your knees,

1215
02:40:54,895 --> 02:40:57,690
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

1216
02:40:57,731 --> 02:40:59,900
and you will feel no more.

1217
02:41:41,525 --> 02:41:42,860
Rack him!

1218
02:42:37,373 --> 02:42:38,874
Enough?

1219
02:43:31,635 --> 02:43:35,055
It can all end right now.

1220
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:37,933
Peace.

1221
02:43:39,184 --> 02:43:42,354
Please, just say it.

1222
02:43:43,439 --> 02:43:46,150
Cry out, "Mercy."

1223
02:43:56,827 --> 02:43:58,287
Mercy!

1224
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:00,080
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1225
02:44:00,205 --> 02:44:01,915
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1226
02:44:05,878 --> 02:44:07,171
Cry out.

1227
02:44:07,546 --> 02:44:10,758
Mercy! Mercy!

1228
02:44:13,635 --> 02:44:15,220
Just say it.

1229
02:44:15,554 --> 02:44:18,140
Mercy.

1230
02:44:18,223 --> 02:44:21,435
Mercy! Mercy!

1231
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:42,748
Mercy, William.

1232
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:45,000
- Mercy.
- Jesus, now say it.

1233
02:44:51,131 --> 02:44:54,593
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1234
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:57,596
Mercy! Mercy!

1235
02:44:57,638 --> 02:44:59,640
Mercy!

1236
02:45:14,405 --> 02:45:21,412
Freedom!

1237
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,439
<i>After the beheading,</i>

1238
02:47:12,481 --> 02:47:15,692
<i>William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.</i>

1239
02:47:18,612 --> 02:47:21,573
<i>His head was set on London Bridge,</i>

1240
02:47:23,116 --> 02:47:28,705
<i>his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain</i>

1241
02:47:28,789 --> 02:47:30,707
<i>as a warning.</i>

1242
02:47:30,791 --> 02:47:35,712
<i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i>

1243
02:47:36,547 --> 02:47:39,675
<i>And I, Robert the Bruce,</i>

1244
02:47:39,758 --> 02:47:44,805
<i>rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English king</i>

1245
02:47:44,846 --> 02:47:48,141
<i>and accept his endorsement of my crown.</i>

1246
02:47:48,934 --> 02:47:51,645
I hope you've washed
your arse this morning.

1247
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:54,189
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1248
02:48:23,468 --> 02:48:25,887
Come. Let's get it over with.

1249
02:48:38,358 --> 02:48:39,484
Stop!

1250
02:48:57,711 --> 02:48:59,880
You have bled with Wallace!

1251
02:49:05,844 --> 02:49:07,554
Now bleed with me.

1252
02:49:48,512 --> 02:49:50,764
Wallace! Wallace!

1253
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:53,433
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace! Wallace!

1254
02:49:53,475 --> 02:49:56,019
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace! Wallace!

1255
02:50:14,955 --> 02:50:17,708
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1314,</i>

1256
02:50:18,917 --> 02:50:22,295
<i>patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,</i>

1257
02:50:22,671 --> 02:50:26,133
<i>charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i>

1258
02:50:26,174 --> 02:50:29,136
<i>They fought like warrior poets.</i>

1259
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:31,304
<i>They fought like Scotsmen,</i>

1260
02:50:32,431 --> 02:50:34,307
<i>and won their freedom.</i>
