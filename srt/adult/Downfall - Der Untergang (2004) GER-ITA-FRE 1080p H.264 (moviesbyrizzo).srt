1
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:30,795
I have the feeling that
I should be angry with this child,

2
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:35,716
with this childish young thing,
or I shouldn't forgive her

3
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:40,263
for not realizing the horrors,
the monster, before it was too late,

4
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,058
for not realizing
what she was getting into.

5
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:47,728
How could I have agreed to it
so impulsively?

6
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,857
I was not an enthusiastic Nazi.

7
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:55,736
When I came to Berlin,
I could have said "No,

8
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:00,032
I won't take part. I don't want to be sent
to the Führer's headquarters."

9
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,619
But I didn't say no.
Curiosity got the better of me.

10
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:07,623
And I simply never thought

11
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,629
that fate would take me somewhere
I'd never really wanted to be.

12
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:19,635
And yet, it's very hard
to forgive myself for doing it.

13
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,310
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,272
Military District ll has confirmed.

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,815
You may pass.

16
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,481
Please take a seat, ladies.

17
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:17,485
I must ask you to wait a few minutes.

18
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,988
The Führer is feeding his dog.
He will be with you shortly.

19
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:27,328
Tell me... How do we...
How does one greet the Führer?

20
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,166
The Führer will speak to you first,
and you just say, "Heil, my Führer."

21
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,293
What about the Nazi salute?

22
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:39,465
That won't be necessary. The Führer
isn't recruiting you as soldiers,

23
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:41,092
he's looking for a secretary.

24
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:45,429
Behave normally.
Just be natural.

25
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,890
I'll ask him if he has time
for you now.

26
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,147
My Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

27
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:20,339
I'd like to thank you for coming
in the middle of the night, ladies.

28
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:25,970
But in war, we aren't always
masters of our own time.

29
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:31,684
May I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz. Heil, my Führer.

30
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:34,562
- Where are you from?
- Fulda. Heil, my Führer.

31
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,398
- And you?
- Ursula Puttkammer.

32
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,025
Heil, my Führer.
- Leave that out, child.

33
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:42,445
Tell me where you're from.

34
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,196
Frankfurt on the Main, my Fuhr...

35
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:49,618
I'm Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

36
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,912
To be precise, I come from Pankow.

37
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,958
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Swabia.

38
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:58,461
And you?

39
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,255
Traudl Humps. I come from Munich.

40
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,925
A Munich girl.

41
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:14,643
So, Fräulein Humps...

42
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,271
Shall we start?

43
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,366
Blondi won't hurt you.

44
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:32,036
She has a very sharp mind.

45
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:35,206
In fact, she's more clever
than most people are.

46
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,213
Just make yourself comfortable.

47
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:48,344
Don't be nervous.
I make so many mistakes when I dictate...

48
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,013
You'll never make as many as I do.

49
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,774
You're quite young.

50
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:04,735
How old are you?

51
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:06,946
22, my Führer.

52
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,827
My national comrades...

53
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,580
German men and women...

54
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,749
Members of the Party...

55
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,294
It is, I believe, a rare thing

56
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:30,302
that a man can stand before
his old supporters after 20 years in office,

57
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,974
and that during those 20 years

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,979
he did not have to modify
his policies whatsoever.

59
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,789
I suggest...
that we try it again.

60
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,761
I made it! He gave me a job!

61
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,285
Duck!

62
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:44,126
Keep moving! Get off the street!

63
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,088
Duck!

64
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,935
That's artillery.

65
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:05,064
Are you crazy?
How could they be firing artillery?

66
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:10,402
Frau Junge, you're right!
Those aren't bombs, it's artillery!

67
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,781
It's the Russians.
What a fine birthday present!

68
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,872
What's going on, Burgdorf?
Where's that gunfire coming from?

69
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,458
Happy birthday, my Führer.

70
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,836
Central Berlin is being shelled,

71
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:30,381
from the Brandenburg Gate
to the Reichstag,

72
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:34,426
up to Friedrichstrasse Station.
- Where from?

73
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:38,180
- No reports yet. Koller's on the line.
- Give him to me.

74
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:43,852
Keller, do you realize Berlin
is under artillery fire?

75
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,813
<i>- No.
- Don't tell me</i>

76
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,648
you can't hear the gunfire!

77
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:51,026
- No, I'm at Werder Game Park.
- Berlin's in uproar!

78
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:54,405
The Russians have taken
a rail bridge on the Oder.

79
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:57,324
They've got no railway batteries
near the Oder.

80
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,536
That's not long-range gunfire.

81
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,205
<i>The flak command post
in the Zoo-bunker</i>

82
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,041
<i>claims the guns have a caliber</i>

83
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,168
of just 10 to 12 cm.

84
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,713
The Russian battery
is now in Marzahn.

85
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,882
That's only 12 kilometres
from the city centre!

86
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:15,300
Are the Russians that close?

87
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:19,054
The entire Air Force Command
should be hanged!

88
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,516
Outrageous!

89
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:23,976
Outrageous!

90
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,104
The Russians are just 12 kilometres
from the city centre,

91
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:30,607
and nobody told me!
I had to ask!

92
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,486
My Führer, perhaps
it's long-range gunfire.

93
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,447
You mentioned a railway battery...

94
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,240
Nonsense!

95
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,875
- Himmler is such a pompous clown!
- Big shots!

96
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:52,546
Big shots everywhere! It makes me sick
just looking at them!

97
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,093
The Führer is putting "Clausewitz"
into operation today.

98
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,598
Berlin as a front-line city...
He won't be able to hold the city.

99
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,310
If the Führer stays,
he'll take the whole Reich down with him.

100
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,020
We have to talk him out of it.

101
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,522
Speak to Hewel.

102
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,107
The Führer likes him.

103
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:14,109
He's the only diplomat
who can still influence him.

104
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:15,319
Hewel tried everything.

105
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,196
Believe me, it's no use.

106
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,199
Then talk to your sister-in-law.

107
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,661
Why not? You're married
to Eva Braun's sister,

108
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,955
so you're "related" to the Führer.

109
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:28,207
We have to try everything.

110
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,417
Berlin is practically
surrounded by the Russians.

111
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,462
You're young.
You'll be a father soon.

112
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,297
Do you want to die in Berlin?

113
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,090
Certainly not.

114
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,681
Gentlemen, the Führer!

115
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:58,987
Everything out, and quick!
We're leaving in two hours.

116
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,164
- What's going on?
- We're packing!

117
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:13,794
Leaving... Haven't you heard?
"Clausewitz" is in effect.

118
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:17,589
All government departments
and Wehrmacht offices are leaving Berlin.

119
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,677
Who's going to feed
the civilians and soldiers?

120
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,762
Don't ask me, Professor.

121
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,223
This is insane!

122
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,534
Ah, Professor!

123
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,081
- I won't allow my staff to be evacuated!
- Is that so?

124
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,750
The food supply to Berlin
will collapse!

125
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,879
A good soldier always finds
something to eat!

126
00:10:57,045 --> 00:11:02,384
Sure! And when fighting begins,
who will he take food from? Civilians!

127
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,596
I cannot permit it!
- The Führer's orders!

128
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:10,642
As the department head,
I answer to the SS and to Himmler!

129
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:15,188
But as a doctor I belong
to the Wehrmacht, and we are still here!

130
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,482
Please bear that in mind!

131
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:27,451
The professor can stay in Berlin!
Give him an authorized permit!

132
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:32,122
Move out!

133
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,846
Everything for Germany.
Heil, my Führer!

134
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:53,143
My Führer, I... Heil, my Führer!

135
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:56,271
They can hardly wait to get away.

136
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,690
I hate those two-faced sods who say

137
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:03,111
"Sieg Heil", but behind their backs say,
"Kiss my a... aunt."

138
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,200
My Führer...

139
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,870
I beg you to leave Berlin.
It's not too late.

140
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,122
Too late?

141
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,000
Come here, Hewel.

142
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:22,339
Hewel, you also feel we should
get in touch with the Allies...

143
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,549
...and use politics.

144
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:27,302
Yes, indeed.

145
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:29,471
We should use politics.

146
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:33,809
Politics? No more politics!

147
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,645
I'm sick of politics!

148
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:41,483
When I'm dead, you'll have
enough politics to deal with!

149
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,567
My Führer...

150
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,570
It's okay, my dear Himmler.

151
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,865
My loyal Heinrich.

152
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:51,576
It's okay...

153
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:53,787
Go now.

154
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:16,184
- Between us, I'd say he's had it.
- Yeah?

155
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:20,355
What do you expect from a teetotal,
non-smoking vegetarian?

156
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:21,565
Be serious.

157
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,692
I'll have to take it
into my own hands.

158
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,154
Berlin will fall
in the next few days.

159
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:32,117
Once the Führer is dead,
who will the Allies negotiate with?

160
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,079
What makes you so sure
they'll negotiate?

161
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:39,249
They need the Nazi state and my SS
to keep order after the war.

162
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,587
Give me an hour with Eisenhower,
and he'll agree.

163
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:48,216
We're already in touch.
- Be careful, that's treason.

164
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:51,094
Fegelein, I have other worries.

165
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:56,391
Should I give Eisenhower
the Nazi salute or shake his hand?

166
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:03,648
Well, well...

167
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:09,362
The later it gets,
the nicer the guests.

168
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:12,866
Gentlemen, are you leaving already?

169
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,618
I wanted to talk to you.

170
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:19,790
The Führer's orders to destroy all public...
- I really must go.

171
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,418
Drop in to visit me
at Hohenlychen sometime.

172
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:31,134
My staff and I are heading north
to support the battle for Berlin.

173
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:42,187
<i>So, Speer...</i>

174
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:45,774
The bombing raids on our cities
have a positive side too.

175
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,196
It's much easier to remove the debris
than to tear everything down.

176
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:57,160
Once we win the war, reconstruction
will be completed very quickly.

177
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:03,917
How many thousands of hours have we spent
on these magnificent models?

178
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:08,046
You're a true genius, Speer.

179
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,299
Yes, you are.

180
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:15,762
Only you and I realize
that a Third Reich isn't possible

181
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,849
if it only consists of department stores
and factories,

182
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,059
skyscrapers and hotels.

183
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,439
This Third Reich will be a treasure house
of art and culture

184
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,276
that will survive the millennia...

185
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:34,364
We see before us the ancient cities,
the Acropolis,

186
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:38,118
we see medieval cities
with their cathedrals,

187
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,788
and we know that people need
something like this, a centre.

188
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,086
Yes, Speer...

189
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,215
That was my vision...

190
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,219
And it still is.

191
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,140
My Führer...

192
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,935
If you want to realize these plans,
you should leave Berlin.

193
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:12,694
Say something, Eva.

194
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:14,905
He's the Führer.

195
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,656
He knows what's right.

196
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:19,367
Please leave Berlin.

197
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,703
The Russians have nearly cut us off.

198
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,331
I can't do that, child.

199
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,459
I'd feel like a lama

200
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,670
spinning an empty prayer-wheel.

201
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:35,217
I must force an outcome in Berlin,
or face my downfall.

202
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,054
Speer

203
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,058
What do you say?

204
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:46,853
You must be on stage
when the curtain falls.

205
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,123
Reload!

206
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,469
Leave me alone!

207
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:24,432
How old are you? 12?
And you? 14?

208
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,226
And you?
Do you want to play war?

209
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,728
Go home, play another game!
- Who are you?

210
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:31,648
What do you want?
- My son... alive.

211
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,817
You should be proud of him.

212
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,530
He destroyed two tanks.
The Führer is giving him a medal.

213
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,867
You're young.
On which front did you fight?

214
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,203
I haven't had the honour yet.

215
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:50,875
You're lucky you haven't seen a battle yet.
Send the children home.

216
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,795
We will fight to the very last man.

217
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:55,588
What are you defending?

218
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,674
This is nothing but a trap.

219
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:01,803
The Russians will attack from both sides,
so there's no escape.

220
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,388
We'll shoot back at them!

221
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,474
- With what?
- We're using flak as artillery.

222
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,103
The Russians are coming,
several armies with tanks

223
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,731
and heavy artillery.
Do you really believe

224
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:15,734
you can hold off their assault
for even five minutes?

225
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,944
We made our pledge to the Führer.

226
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:22,490
Don't you understand?
We've lost the war! It's over!

227
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,534
Coward!

228
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,291
Get outta here! Now!

229
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,713
When the Russians come
and you're still here, you'll all die!

230
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:43,303
I may be repeating myself,
but the 9th Army must retreat.

231
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,472
Otherwise, it will be wiped out.

232
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,641
The 9th Army will not retreat!

233
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,811
Tell Busse to fight where he stands.

234
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:54,814
In that case, the 9th Army is lost.

235
00:18:54,981 --> 00:19:00,737
We will drive back the Soviet units
in the north and east

236
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:05,492
with a relentless
and almighty assault.

237
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,202
With which units?

238
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:13,041
Steiner's division will attack from the north
and unite with the 9th.

239
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,545
The 9th Army is unable to move north.

240
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:20,632
The enemy outnumbers us 10 to 1.

241
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,052
Have Wenck support them
with the 12th Army.

242
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,305
But the 12th Army is marching west,
to the Elbe.

243
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,849
Then tell them to turn around!

244
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:33,937
- That would expose the Western front.
- Are you questioning my orders?

245
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:38,983
I believe I've made myself
perfectly clear!

246
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:44,447
The western Allies will realize
that only we can hold off the Bolsheviks.

247
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:47,534
We're the last bulwark
against the Asian hordes.

248
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,704
If we hold Berlin for a few more days
we'll make a deal with the Americans.

249
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:12,600
Ah, Mohnke...

250
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,562
...you're here.
- My Führer.

251
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:21,151
I put "Clausewitz" into effect today.
Berlin is now a front-line city.

252
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:26,448
You're in charge of defending
the government district.

253
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:31,161
If there's a battle in Berlin,
we'll fight to the last man.

254
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,830
But there are over
3 million civilians.

255
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,665
They have to be evacuated.

256
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,961
I appreciate your concern, Mohnke.

257
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,840
But we have to be cold-blooded.

258
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:47,802
We can't worry about
these so-called civilians now!

259
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:53,600
With all due respect, what will become
of the women and children,

260
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,019
the thousands of wounded,
and the elderly?

261
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:01,024
In a war like this
there are no civilians.

262
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:04,319
The Führer has lost
all sense of reality.

263
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,322
He moves divisions
that only exist on his map.

264
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:10,617
Steiner's scattered unit
can hardly defend itself,

265
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,745
and now he wants Steiner to attack.
It's insane!

266
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,832
Tell him yourself.
- He wouldn't listen. You know that.

267
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,667
- Something has to be done.
- Are you crazy?

268
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,378
He'd kick us out like Rundstedt and Guderian.
- So what?

269
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:28,259
We're soldiers!
We pledged our allegiance to the Führer!

270
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:31,262
Should that prevent us from thinking?

271
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:35,058
Look who's talking! An opportunist!
A ruthless careerist!

272
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,226
Pardon?

273
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,504
- Where were you?
- None of your damned business!

274
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:17,058
My Führer, Berlin Hitler Youth's
most successful tank hunters.

275
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,194
I'm proud of you all.

276
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:35,451
My Führer, this boy alone
destroyed two tanks with a bazooka.

277
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:38,371
His name is Peter Kranz.

278
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:40,748
So your name is Peter.

279
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:46,254
I wish my generals had your courage.

280
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:57,557
Fine, fine.

281
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,982
History will take note of you.

282
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:11,404
And when Germania rises up
from these ruins,

283
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,323
you'll be the heroes.

284
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,535
Heil to you!

285
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,816
I don't know about you,

286
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,527
but this gives me the creeps.
I prefer bombing raids.

287
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,696
What will happen to us?

288
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:56,741
Yesterday, he told me it was alright
if I left.

289
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,828
Everyone's deserting him.

290
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,413
We can't just get up and leave.

291
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,374
I can't either.

292
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,173
I've no idea where I should go.

293
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:17,261
My parents and friends back home
warned me.

294
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:20,890
They told me
not to get involved with the Nazis.

295
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:24,936
Should I go back and say,
"I'm home. I made a mistake.

296
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,522
When things got bad
I realized my mistake."

297
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:31,234
Life will go on, somehow.

298
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:41,786
What do you think, Colonel?

299
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:43,913
We should go.

300
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,417
Where to?

301
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:51,963
I don't know.
Some place where we're needed.

302
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:06,936
Come upstairs, everyone!
We're going to have a party!

303
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,855
Come on!

304
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:13,067
Come on, kids!

305
00:25:20,992 --> 00:25:22,952
I want us to have some fun today.

306
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,169
No matter where the enemy goes

307
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,671
he has to find nothing but wasteland.

308
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:37,675
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

309
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:41,721
No electricity, no gas,
no clean water,

310
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,598
no coal, no transportation.

311
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:48,519
By destroying all our railways,
canals, docks, ships and locomotives,

312
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,980
we would hurl Germany
back to the Middle Ages.

313
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:54,609
You'd be robbing our people
of every chance to survive.

314
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:58,863
If the war is lost, it's immaterial
if the people perish too.

315
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,657
It is not necessary

316
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:06,537
to consider the German people's
primitive survival needs.

317
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,916
On the contrary, it is better
to destroy those things ourselves.

318
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,462
They have proved themselves too weak
and it is a law of nature

319
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:16,881
that they will be exterminated.

320
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:20,176
They are your people.
You are the Führer.

321
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:23,638
The only ones
who will survive the battle

322
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:27,975
are the inferior ones.
Our best people have fallen already.

323
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:35,316
Here you go.

324
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:39,320
Oh, come on,
you're supposed to dance.

325
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:43,699
With pleasure.

326
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:11,060
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

327
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:13,062
What's the matter?

328
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:21,779
Convince him
that we have to leave Berlin, Eva!

329
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,034
Or come with me.

330
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,461
You're going to die.

331
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:00,401
Put on the music!

332
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:01,777
I want to dance!

333
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,696
Dance!

334
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,411
- Anything is particular?
- Swing.

335
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:39,982
Traudl...

336
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,490
It's all so unreal...

337
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,409
...like a dream

338
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:54,121
where you want to wake up,
but you can't.

339
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,583
It keeps going on and on...

340
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:04,006
Gerda, I feel sick...

341
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:43,587
Come on! Come on!

342
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,357
I haven't moved my command...

343
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:08,154
I haven't moved my command post!

344
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,741
...to the west...?

345
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:15,536
I'm 1,000 metres from the enemy!
- General!

346
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,843
Hello? Hello!

347
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:37,058
The report, General?

348
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:41,437
- I'm to be shot.
- What? What for?

349
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,648
They claim that I moved
my command post

350
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:48,110
to the west, away from the enemy.
- Not a bad idea.

351
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,696
Come with me.

352
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,006
- Schenck.
- Mohnke.

353
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:14,470
I'm at the chancellery bunker
defending the government district.

354
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:16,222
<i>I need your help.</i>

355
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:19,350
That's difficult,
everyone's been evacuated.

356
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:22,019
Everyone's gone
except me and my adjutant.

357
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,187
You're a doctor?

358
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:24,438
Yes. Internist.

359
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:26,899
Find a vehicle and bring us

360
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:29,443
<i>all the morphine, penicillin</i>

361
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,821
and first-aid supplies you can find!

362
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:33,906
I'll see what I can do.

363
00:31:34,073 --> 00:31:35,991
Thank you, and hurry.

364
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,543
I have to see the Führer.

365
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,462
What for?

366
00:32:30,963 --> 00:32:32,423
I'm to be shot.

367
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,511
Wait here.

368
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:41,182
Your guns, please.

369
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,147
Not here.

370
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,986
Guard post 2.

371
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,197
Roger.

372
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:58,824
General...

373
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:03,370
Not you.

374
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,184
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

375
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:26,352
Heil Hitler.

376
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:29,396
What's going on?
Why am I to be shot?

377
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:34,568
You know the Führer has forbidden
any westward retreat.

378
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:39,949
Officers who disobey are to be arrested
and shot on the spot.

379
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:43,619
What do you mean?
My units have been in fierce battle for days!

380
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,997
My command post is just one kilometre
from the front line.

381
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:49,875
Go on.

382
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:55,464
You see this, don't you?
Don't use that tone with me!

383
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,676
Now do what you have to do!

384
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,057
I think you should explain it
to the Führer yourself. Come along.

385
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:24,285
- I can't let you through.
- I'm here on orders from Commander Mohnke.

386
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:27,496
We need first-aid material
from the military hospital.

387
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:30,082
It's empty. They all left.

388
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,794
- And the wounded?
- How should I know?

389
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:35,004
- I'll have a look.
- Colonel!

390
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,088
Stay here!

391
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:38,716
Careful you don't get killed.

392
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,801
There are Russians everywhere.

393
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,219
See that?

394
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,638
It's the end of the Reich.

395
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:46,348
That's Russki territory!

396
00:34:58,485 --> 00:34:59,820
May I?

397
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,203
He's so damn stubborn.

398
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,080
Why didn't he let me do it?

399
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,062
I should be with my troops.
Are you sure the Führer needs me?

400
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:19,108
Drink up! The Führer's orders!

401
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:22,736
You really impressed the Führer.

402
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:25,364
You don't think Steiner'll attack?

403
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,534
I doubt that Steiner's units
are able to attack,

404
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,995
but why am I telling you this?
You know better than I do.

405
00:36:32,162 --> 00:36:36,083
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin will be lost.

406
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,594
Congratulations, your report
really impressed the Führer.

407
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,014
He has appointed you
commander of Berlin's defence.

408
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:57,396
I'd rather have been shot
than have this honour...

409
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,755
Tank alarm!

410
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:29,428
Stay calm.
They're too far away to do anything.

411
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,389
Out of the way please, ladies.

412
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:22,689
- Is that German artillery out there?
- I'm afraid not.

413
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:25,025
But Steiner's attack
should be underway by now!

414
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:31,323
You have to leave.
There isn't much time.

415
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:34,326
But the Führer believes
Steiner's attack

416
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,787
will make good of the situation.

417
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:40,832
I heard him say that Steiner's assault
will turn things around.

418
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,753
All the Führer's advisors
know that's absurd!

419
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,256
I'd not be surprised if he thinks so too.

420
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:50,592
Why would he deceive us?

421
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,719
What does he have to lose?

422
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:55,722
I don't believe a word of it!

423
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:59,268
The enemy has broken through
along a wide front.

424
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:03,021
They've taken Zossen to the south
and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

425
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,359
They're on the northern outskirts
between Frohnau and Pankow.

426
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:11,530
They've reached Lichtenberg,
Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

427
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:16,785
Steiner's assault
will bring it under control.

428
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,456
My Führer...

429
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,167
Steiner...

430
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,172
Steiner couldn't mobilize
enough men.

431
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,883
He wasn't able
to carry out his assault.

432
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:54,406
These men will stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

433
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:10,339
That was an order!

434
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,550
Steiner's assault was an order!

435
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:19,139
Who do you think you are
to dare disobey an order that I give?

436
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,477
So this is what it has come to!

437
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:27,064
The military has been lying to me.

438
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,233
Everybody has been lying to me.
Even the SS!

439
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:36,031
Our generals are just a bunch
of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

440
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:38,617
I can't permit you
to insult the soldiers--

441
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:41,995
They are cowards,
traitors and failures!

442
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:43,955
My Führer, this is outrageous!

443
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:47,709
Our generals are the scum
of the German people!

444
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:50,337
Not a shred of honour!

445
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:56,051
They call themselves generals!
Years at military academy

446
00:40:56,385 --> 00:40:59,388
just to learn how to hold
a knife and fork!

447
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:03,892
For years, the military
has hindered my plans!

448
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:09,564
They've put every kind of obstacle
in my way!

449
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,151
What I should have done

450
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:18,031
is liquidate all the high-ranking officers,
as Stalin did!

451
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,247
I never attended an academy,

452
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:32,212
and yet I have conquered Europe
all by myself!

453
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,260
Traitors!

454
00:41:38,593 --> 00:41:43,306
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the very beginning!

455
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:48,729
What a monstrous betrayal
of the German people.

456
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:51,565
But all those traitors will pay.

457
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,485
They'll pay with their own blood.

458
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:58,655
They shall drown in their own blood!

459
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:03,410
Gerda, please calm yourself.

460
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,961
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

461
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:19,342
Under these circumstances,
I am no longer able to lead...

462
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,179
It's over.

463
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:29,770
The war is lost.

464
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:39,905
But, gentlemen, if you believe
I am going to leave Berlin,

465
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:44,534
you are seriously mistaken.
I'd rather blow my brains out.

466
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,208
Do whatever you like.

467
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:15,565
The Führer didn't really mean
he'd shoot himself...

468
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,152
Frau Junge
and Frau Christian...

469
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:26,451
Get changed. A plane is leaving in an hour.
It will take you south.

470
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,288
Everything is lost...

471
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:33,583
Hopelessly lost.

472
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:41,049
You know I'll stay with you.
I won't let you send me away.

473
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:54,354
I'm staying too!

474
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:20,839
What now?

475
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:23,842
It's time to end this spectacle.

476
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:27,929
What? You want to give up?
That's unthinkable.

477
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:30,974
The Führer said we won't surrender.

478
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:33,852
We won't repeat November 1918.
Never!

479
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,438
You heard him.
He'll no longer lead us.

480
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:39,065
He said, "Do whatever you want."

481
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:41,818
No one here can replace him. No one.
The Führer is the Führer!

482
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:45,238
The Führer lost his composure.
He'll pull himself together.

483
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:48,408
Great.
And what happens then?

484
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:54,581
We can never surrender.
The Führer would never approve.

485
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:58,084
We swore to obey his will.
- Nothing but empty phrases!

486
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:01,546
We have to do something
before it's too late.

487
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,882
- You want to save your own skin.
- Stop it!

488
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:15,060
Damn it!

489
00:45:19,773 --> 00:45:22,859
We'll never get out alive.
It's all over.

490
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:25,570
Just wait.

491
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:29,574
But the Filhrer is uncertain.
What if he kills himself?

492
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:33,912
Gijnsche said there's a tunnel
under the Russian lines to the Yanks.

493
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:37,791
Why did you say you'd stay with him?

494
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:41,294
I don't know... honestly.

495
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:47,467
They've stopped. Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

496
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:30,176
Traudl...

497
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:32,595
Look“.

498
00:46:54,743 --> 00:46:57,412
Hey girls, I need a cigarette.

499
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,390
Let's go back down again.

500
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,007
- Where did they come from?
- New Volkssturm recruits!

501
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:52,801
Assigned this afternoon!

502
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:56,304
Tell them to get out
of the line of fire!

503
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:03,853
These recruits
are under Dr. Goebbels' command!

504
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:10,485
I want them outta there, right away!
This is crazy!

505
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:12,570
I'll answer for it.

506
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:25,542
I'm not sure it's the right way.

507
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,460
Oh, splendid.

508
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,130
Stop! Lights out!

509
00:48:31,297 --> 00:48:33,174
Stop. Don't move.

510
00:48:33,842 --> 00:48:35,635
Don't move.

511
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,178
Lucky! Germans.

512
00:48:41,724 --> 00:48:43,852
Help! They want to kill us!

513
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:47,438
- What's going on here?
- They're MPs.

514
00:48:47,772 --> 00:48:49,482
I don't believe it!

515
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:02,453
Stop it! Let those men go!

516
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,207
What's going on here?
- It's none of your business!

517
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:09,752
We found these deserters
in their homes.

518
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:11,796
They'll be shot, like every traitor.

519
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:15,008
They're old men, civilians.

520
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:16,217
You can't do that!

521
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:17,385
No?

522
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,682
Who's going to stop me? You?

523
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,394
Stop! That's enough!

524
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:42,869
Move out!

525
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:27,890
Here's a doctor.

526
00:51:36,024 --> 00:51:37,191
Can you operate?

527
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:39,319
Not really.

528
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:44,615
Tell Ilse that the children
can't take too many toys.

529
00:51:44,782 --> 00:51:45,825
One toy per child.

530
00:51:46,617 --> 00:51:51,205
And no unnecessary nightclothes.
- Minister Goebbels...

531
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:53,458
My wife and children are coming.

532
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:55,918
Please take care of them.

533
00:51:57,086 --> 00:52:00,214
Thank you.
BrigadeFührer, what can I do for you?

534
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:03,676
The Russians are mowing down
your Volkssturm recruits.

535
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:07,055
They lack experience
and suitable weapons.

536
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:12,685
That is compensated for
by their fervent belief in the final victory.

537
00:52:12,852 --> 00:52:15,396
If you can't arm these men,

538
00:52:15,563 --> 00:52:18,358
they can't fight.
They are dying in vain.

539
00:52:19,692 --> 00:52:21,694
I feel no sympathy.

540
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,699
I repeat, I feel no sympathy!

541
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:29,285
The German people chose their fate.

542
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:34,916
That may surprise some people.
Don't fool yourself.

543
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,751
We didn't force the German people.

544
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:41,631
They gave us the mandate.
And now their little throats are being cut.

545
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:55,645
Yes?

546
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,317
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

547
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:03,111
<i>- Hermann!
- Don't be stupid.</i>

548
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:04,654
It's a matter of life and death.

549
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:07,698
How can you say such a thing?
Where are you?

550
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:10,743
I've decided not to die in Berlin.

551
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,788
Hermann, does my sister know
where you are?

552
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:15,957
I have to call you back.

553
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:20,962
Hi there, kids.
Your room's on the right.

554
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:24,757
Wait for me.

555
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,137
- Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Nice to see you, Frau Junge.

556
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:44,110
Come on now, get in line!

557
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:46,904
Come here, Helga. Get in line.

558
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,365
We'll put on our best clothes,

559
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:52,618
and then you can say hello
to Uncle Hitler.

560
00:53:52,785 --> 00:53:55,455
Yes! Yes! Yes!

561
00:53:56,456 --> 00:53:57,623
Remember your song?

562
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,834
Yes.

563
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:04,130
<i>No land is more beautiful</i>

564
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:10,011
<i>Far and wide
than the land we call our own...</i>

565
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:42,001
If you want to be certain
shoot the gun into your mouth.

566
00:54:42,668 --> 00:54:44,795
Your skull will explode.

567
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:49,550
You don't notice a thing.
You die immediately.

568
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:53,429
I want to look nice when I'm dead.
I'll take poison.

569
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:57,475
If I'm going to die heroically
I don't want to feel any pain.

570
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:59,435
That's a sure-fire way.

571
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:04,398
It paralyzes the nerves
and the respiratory system.

572
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:06,984
You die within seconds.

573
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,779
Could I have one, too?

574
00:55:09,946 --> 00:55:11,489
Me, too.

575
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:21,749
Thank goodness
Himmler left me well supplied.

576
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:41,477
Thank you.

577
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:47,149
I'm so sorry I can't give you
a better present.

578
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:57,660
<i>Berlin, April 23rd,</i>

579
00:55:58,452 --> 00:55:59,996
<i>1945.</i>

580
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:08,129
<i>My dearest sister, I'm so sorry
I have to write you this.</i>

581
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:13,134
<i>But there's nothing we can do.
At any minute, it could all be over.</i>

582
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:17,346
<i>You should know
that Hermann isn't here.</i>

583
00:56:17,513 --> 00:56:21,350
<i>But I truly believe
you'll see him again.</i>

584
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:25,605
<i>I'm sure he'll continue
the fight in Bavaria</i>

585
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,565
<i>for a certain time.</i>

586
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:31,485
<i>The Führer has lost all belief
in a favourable outcome.</i>

587
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:36,824
<i>My beloved son, I don't know
if this letter will reach you.</i>

588
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:39,243
<i>Perhaps there is some human soul</i>

589
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,371
<i>who will pass on
my final words to you.</i>

590
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:46,375
<i>I've stayed with Papa
against his will.</i>

591
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:50,379
<i>Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me leave.</i>

592
00:56:50,546 --> 00:56:53,549
<i>You know your mother well.
We have the same blood.</i>

593
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:57,261
<i>I had no second thoughts.
Our magnificent idea has died...</i>

594
00:56:57,428 --> 00:57:02,975
<i>...along with every beautiful,
admirable, noble, good thing</i>

595
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:04,977
<i>I've ever known.
The world after the Führer's death</i>

596
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:08,397
<i>and after National Socialism
is no longer worth living in.</i>

597
00:57:08,564 --> 00:57:11,400
<i>That's why the children are here.</i>

598
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,944
<i>They are too good
for what will come.</i>

599
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:19,367
<i>A merciful God will understand me
for giving them redemption.</i>

600
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:31,170
<i>I'll wear the golden bracelet
with the green stone until the very end.</i>

601
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:34,799
<i>Then it may be taken from me,
and you shall wear it</i>

602
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:37,093
<i>just as I have always worn it.</i>

603
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:42,348
<i>I'm afraid I sent my diamond watch
to the jeweller's.</i>

604
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:44,350
<i>I wrote the address at the bottom.</i>

605
00:57:45,017 --> 00:57:47,395
<i>If you're lucky,
you can get it back.</i>

606
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,105
<i>I want you to have it.</i>

607
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,859
<i>You'll also get the diamond bracelet</i>

608
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:58,072
<i>and the topaz pendant
which the Führer gave me for my birthday.</i>

609
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:03,077
<i>The bill I'm including for Heise & Co.
hasn't been paid yet.</i>

610
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,454
<i>You might receive some other bills, too,</i>

611
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:09,083
<i>but not for more
than 1,500 Reichsmarks.</i>

612
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:17,383
<i>Please burn all private and business letters
to the Führer at once.</i>

613
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:21,846
<i>I'm also sending you
food and cigarettes.</i>

614
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:25,433
<i>Please give Lindners and Kargels
some of the coffee.</i>

615
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:30,020
<i>The cigarettes are for Mandi.
The tobacco is for Papa.</i>

616
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:31,814
<i>The chocolate is for Mom.</i>

617
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:36,193
<i>That's all I can tell you.
It's enough for now.</i>

618
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:41,991
<i>I wish you the best of luck,
my dearest sister.</i>

619
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:43,868
<i>And remember,</i>

620
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,163
<i>I'm sure you'll see Hermann again.
Best regards,</i>

621
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:49,665
<i>and kisses. I remain...</i>

622
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,084
<i>your sister.</i>

623
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:45,304
h1g9!

624
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:40,234
Listen Keitel,
I want you to leave tonight.

625
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:44,321
Make your way to Dénitz.
Help him organize everything.

626
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,617
We have to get things moving again.

627
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:51,495
I don't understand.

628
01:00:52,538 --> 01:00:55,624
It's a disaster.
We have no more oilfields.

629
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:01,130
It's impossible to carry out
far-ranging operations.

630
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:07,136
Once I've managed this situation,
we must recover the oilfields.

631
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,144
Any more questions?

632
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:16,979
No, my Führer.

633
01:01:17,813 --> 01:01:20,149
Fine. Have a nice trip.

634
01:02:47,194 --> 01:02:50,864
"My Führer, Following your decision
to stay in Berlin,

635
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:54,034
"do I have your approval
as Vice Chancellor

636
01:02:54,201 --> 01:02:56,495
"to immediately take charge
of the entire Reich...

637
01:02:57,413 --> 01:03:00,207
"...with the necessary power
and authority?

638
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:03,752
"If I receive no answer
by 10 p.m., I will assume

639
01:03:04,086 --> 01:03:06,213
"that you have been incapacitated.

640
01:03:06,547 --> 01:03:09,967
I will serve the well-being
of our people and fatherland."

641
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,720
He's betraying Germany...

642
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:14,888
And you!

643
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:17,349
G6ring's concern isn't unjustified.

644
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:20,269
If our communication system
breaks down,

645
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:22,521
which could happen any time,

646
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,690
we'd be cut off
from the world.

647
01:03:25,357 --> 01:03:27,317
We could no longer
pass on orders.

648
01:03:27,651 --> 01:03:30,571
I see it differently.
Goéring wants to seize power.

649
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:35,701
I never trusted that mob he gathered
at Obersalzberg. It stinks of a coup.

650
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:40,956
That failure!
That bloodsucker!

651
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,585
A parvenu! A lazybones!

652
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:49,048
How dare he declare me
unable to act!

653
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:52,551
Tomorrow he might declare me dead!
- Hello, Frau Junge.

654
01:03:52,718 --> 01:03:54,428
How did you reach Berlin?

655
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:57,514
It wasn't easy.
I have to see the Führer.

656
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:59,558
I'd wait if I were you.

657
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:01,602
The Air Force...

658
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:03,812
What did he do with it?

659
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:07,357
That's reason enough
to execute him!

660
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:14,281
That morphine addict
helped to corrupt this country.

661
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:16,450
And now this!

662
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:20,287
He has betrayed me.

663
01:04:21,288 --> 01:04:24,041
Me!

664
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:35,385
I want Goring to be deprived of power
and removed from office.

665
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:38,639
If I don't survive this war...

666
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:43,060
...that man is to be executed at once.

667
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,355
What about us?

668
01:04:47,898 --> 01:04:48,899
Is there any hope?

669
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,321
Leave before it's too late.

670
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:57,032
The Führer wants to stay here.

671
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,077
We can't leave him alone.

672
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:03,413
For that which awaits the Führer,
he won't need anyone.

673
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,207
Least of all you.

674
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:10,045
But Herr Goebbels and his wife are staying.
The children too.

675
01:05:20,013 --> 01:05:21,098
But the children...

676
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,605
I'd always thought that...

677
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,984
I thought there was some way out...

678
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:40,117
Come in.

679
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,372
Albert... hello.

680
01:05:57,092 --> 01:05:58,260
Fever?

681
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:02,639
Albert, my heart can't take it.

682
01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:07,352
Why don't you take the children
and get out of here?

683
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,022
But where to?

684
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:15,736
I once told you, I can send a barge
to Schwanenwerder.

685
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:19,573
It can be fixed up as a hideout
until it's all over...

686
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:22,492
Which won't be long.

687
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,412
I've thought it through carefully.

688
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:31,001
I won't let the children grow up in a world
with no National Socialism.

689
01:06:35,422 --> 01:06:37,466
Think it over again, Magda.

690
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:39,968
The children deserve a future.

691
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:48,143
If the idea of National Socialism dies,
there is no future.

692
01:07:05,661 --> 01:07:07,287
I can't believe
you really want this.

693
01:07:10,123 --> 01:07:11,291
Go...

694
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:45,325
Come in.

695
01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:51,415
I knew you'd come.

696
01:07:52,624 --> 01:07:54,918
You're not one of those
who'd abandon the Führer.

697
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,634
I... I've just come
to say goodbye to the Führer.

698
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:06,638
I have to return to Hamburg tonight.
- Of course.

699
01:08:06,805 --> 01:08:08,015
Take a seat.

700
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:14,521
Look, I brought some of the furniture
you designed for me.

701
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:17,024
I just couldn't part with it.

702
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:21,403
Come on, help yourself.
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

703
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,531
You happen to be right.

704
01:08:25,741 --> 01:08:26,825
Thanks.

705
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:30,329
It's so important that you came.

706
01:08:31,038 --> 01:08:33,165
It shows him you're on his side.

707
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,959
Did he have his doubts?

708
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:41,298
He's been wondering
if you were possibly against him.

709
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:45,427
But I kept telling him you'd come.
And now you're here.

710
01:08:50,557 --> 01:08:53,518
It pleased him that you advised him
to stay in Berlin.

711
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:56,313
I think it's the right choice, too.

712
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:00,442
You know what?

713
01:09:02,694 --> 01:09:03,987
It may be crazy, but...

714
01:09:06,865 --> 01:09:09,159
I'm really happy
to be able to stay.

715
01:09:10,786 --> 01:09:12,704
And I'm not afraid.

716
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:22,672
Yes?

717
01:09:38,063 --> 01:09:40,899
So... you've come.

718
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:42,734
My Führer...

719
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:45,237
- It's okay.

720
01:09:47,322 --> 01:09:48,824
Let's sit down.

721
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:11,972
I had such big plans
for the Germans and for the world.

722
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:18,937
No one understood me,
not even my oldest comrades.

723
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:28,780
What huge opportunities we had.
The world was within reach...

724
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:33,493
Too late.

725
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:45,380
What I am proud of
is that I openly confronted the Jews...

726
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:51,511
...and I cleansed the German lands
of Jewish poison.

727
01:10:56,057 --> 01:11:00,270
It isn't hard for me to go.
Just that one moment...

728
01:11:06,526 --> 01:11:09,404
...and then eternal peace.

729
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:16,661
Spare the German people,
my Führer.

730
01:11:19,623 --> 01:11:23,210
If my own people fail this test,

731
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,213
I will shed not one tear for them.

732
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:29,257
They deserve nothing else.

733
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:34,471
It's their own destiny.
They themselves are to blame.

734
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:41,978
For months...

735
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:46,399
I must tell you this,
my Führer...

736
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:50,445
For months I have not carried out
your orders of destruction.

737
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:56,993
Documents exist which prove
that I not only ignored,

738
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,871
but even acted contrary
to your orders.

739
01:12:05,585 --> 01:12:07,504
I had to tell you.

740
01:12:16,304 --> 01:12:19,724
My personal loyalty to you
never wavered throughout.

741
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:35,490
So, you're leaving...

742
01:12:38,201 --> 01:12:41,830
Fine. Goodbye.

743
01:12:52,841 --> 01:12:54,509
I wish you all the best.

744
01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:20,952
So gentlemen, eat your fill.

745
01:14:17,008 --> 01:14:18,176
Peter!

746
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:30,522
Everything's okay, my boy.

747
01:14:46,204 --> 01:14:47,330
<i>Fever.</i>

748
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,751
Yes, but he's alive.

749
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:19,446
Courage and loyalty still exist.

750
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,075
Lord Von Greim and Frau Reitsch,
I am pleased that...

751
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:29,414
...you both arrived uninjured,

752
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:31,416
more or less.

753
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:32,667
Be seated.

754
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,256
We were under heavy fire
but were able to land in Gatow.

755
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:42,302
The roads were impassable,

756
01:15:42,469 --> 01:15:46,514
so we got a plane, a Fieseler Starch,
and flew over the Russian lines,

757
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:49,934
landing on the East-West axis,
a few hundred metres from here.

758
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:53,646
Just before landing,
we got hit by Russian artillery.

759
01:15:55,064 --> 01:16:00,153
General Von Greim, I appoint you
Commander-in-chief of the Air Force

760
01:16:00,487 --> 01:16:03,281
and General Field Marshal.

761
01:16:03,448 --> 01:16:07,118
A great responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

762
01:16:07,285 --> 01:16:10,455
You must shake up
the entire Air Force.

763
01:16:10,622 --> 01:16:13,833
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

764
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:18,296
Life never forgives weakness.

765
01:16:20,882 --> 01:16:22,967
This so-called humanity...

766
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,262
...is just priests' drivel.

767
01:16:27,972 --> 01:16:32,352
Compassion is a primal sin.
Compassion for the weak...

768
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:35,313
...is a betrayal of nature.

769
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:40,944
The strongest can only be victorious
by eradicating the weak.

770
01:16:41,903 --> 01:16:45,573
I have always obeyed
this law of nature

771
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,159
by never permitting myself
to feel compassion.

772
01:16:49,828 --> 01:16:53,206
I have ruthlessly suppressed
domestic opposition

773
01:16:53,706 --> 01:16:57,544
and brutally crushed the resistance
of alien races.

774
01:16:58,002 --> 01:16:59,504
It's the only way to deal with it.

775
01:17:01,214 --> 01:17:02,340
Apes, for example,

776
01:17:04,259 --> 01:17:08,137
trample every outsider to death.

777
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:13,935
What goes for apes
goes even more for human beings.

778
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:23,862
In LUbeck,
Himmler has made an offer

779
01:17:25,363 --> 01:17:28,908
to surrender to the western powers

780
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:31,786
through Count Bernadette...

781
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:35,748
...according to a report
by English radio.

782
01:17:39,919 --> 01:17:41,212
Himmler...

783
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:46,509
Of all people, Himmler!

784
01:17:46,843 --> 01:17:49,012
The truest of the true!

785
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:53,683
This is the worst betrayal of all!

786
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:59,981
Goéring, of course...

787
01:18:00,148 --> 01:18:01,733
He was always corrupt.

788
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:05,361
Speer, an idealistic,
unpredictable artist!

789
01:18:05,695 --> 01:18:07,655
All the others! Yes! Yes! Yes!

790
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:10,408
But not Himmler.

791
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:14,704
Has he gone crazy?

792
01:18:15,747 --> 01:18:19,208
He claimed authority
by saying that I was sick,

793
01:18:20,293 --> 01:18:22,295
perhaps already dead.

794
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,931
Please leave me alone
with Lord Von Greim and Frau Reitsch.

795
01:18:34,515 --> 01:18:36,768
And bring me Fegelein.

796
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:39,437
My Führer,
we don't know where he is.

797
01:18:40,188 --> 01:18:43,733
But he's Himmler's adjutant,
he must be here!

798
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,526
We haven't seen him for days.

799
01:18:45,693 --> 01:18:47,570
I want his report at once!

800
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,909
Please stay, Doctor.

801
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:01,292
You and Greim are to leave at once.

802
01:19:01,793 --> 01:19:05,546
Fly to Dénitz.
Tell him to do everything necessary

803
01:19:05,713 --> 01:19:08,675
to ensure Himmler
receives just punishment.

804
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:12,720
My Führer, Lord Von Greim and I
have decided to die with you here.

805
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:18,685
Thank you for this sign of loyalty.

806
01:19:19,686 --> 01:19:21,396
But Himmler must die.

807
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:23,356
He committed treason!

808
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:28,653
It was the right decision
not to inform him of my plans.

809
01:19:28,903 --> 01:19:29,862
My Führer?

810
01:19:30,863 --> 01:19:34,701
Do you think I'd stand by and watch
those Jewish pigs do me in?

811
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:38,079
This is all part
of a gigantic ploy.

812
01:19:38,246 --> 01:19:41,541
I allowed the enemy
to invade the Reich.

813
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:44,794
They believe they've won,
but you'll see, Greim.

814
01:19:45,837 --> 01:19:47,922
It'll be a rude awakening for them.

815
01:19:48,881 --> 01:19:52,927
Dénitz is mobilizing troops in the north,
Kesselring in the south.

816
01:19:53,094 --> 01:19:57,348
We will crush the enemy
in a massive pincer movement.

817
01:19:57,515 --> 01:20:03,146
And I have 3 armies near Prague
which will attack from behind.

818
01:20:03,938 --> 01:20:08,609
I had no idea that we still have
so many troops available.

819
01:20:09,694 --> 01:20:12,321
I have made arrangements
that within a short time

820
01:20:12,655 --> 01:20:17,160
you will have thousands
of jet fighter aircraft,

821
01:20:17,952 --> 01:20:21,748
so you can make the Air Force
as powerful as it once was!

822
01:20:22,707 --> 01:20:27,587
I kneel down to your genius and
before the altar of our fatherland.

823
01:20:42,226 --> 01:20:43,811
<i>He“, my Führer.</i>

824
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:50,234
You have requested
to leave Berlin?

825
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:56,157
As you know,
all the medical units and staff

826
01:20:56,491 --> 01:21:00,244
under Himmler's authority
have left Berlin.

827
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:04,791
Himmler is a traitor.
He will receive the punishment he deserves.

828
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:10,838
As an SS physician,
I have no more duties here.

829
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:15,134
Your application to leave Berlin
is completely unacceptable.

830
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,638
My... family...

831
01:21:20,264 --> 01:21:23,726
If the Russians find me here...
I have to leave!

832
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:28,272
You did nothing wrong.
Future generations

833
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:31,776
will be thankful
for the medical research you did.

834
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,403
I'll take responsibility for it all.

835
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,829
Let's discuss this another time.

836
01:21:57,468 --> 01:21:59,679
We can't find
GruppenFührer Fegelein.

837
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:04,892
He is not in the bunker.
- What do you mean, "can't find him"?

838
01:22:05,643 --> 01:22:07,145
Then look for him!

839
01:22:07,645 --> 01:22:10,189
I want to see Fegelein at once!

840
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:15,153
If he's gone AWOL,
it's desertion! Treason!

841
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:18,823
Bring me Fegelein!
Fegelein!

842
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,033
Fegelein! Fegelein!

843
01:22:31,836 --> 01:22:34,881
Dad, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

844
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:40,720
Ernst... is something wrong?

845
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:42,138
No.

846
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:44,515
Thank you.

847
01:22:45,224 --> 01:22:47,310
Gitte is hungry, too.

848
01:22:49,187 --> 01:22:52,899
Well, Ilse,
now you have to eat something, too.

849
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:56,569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

850
01:23:01,699 --> 01:23:03,075
Thank you.

851
01:23:57,213 --> 01:23:58,214
What's going on?

852
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:00,132
You're under arrest.

853
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,261
- What?
- For desertion.

854
01:24:03,928 --> 01:24:06,055
Get dressed.
You must come with us.

855
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,266
Kiss my ass!

856
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:16,399
Let go, you bastard!
You got no right!

857
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:21,445
Please don't let them
kill Hermann.

858
01:24:22,363 --> 01:24:24,949
He wanted to flee,
it's beyond doubt.

859
01:24:25,783 --> 01:24:29,287
So what?
It's all over anyway.

860
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:33,040
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant!

861
01:24:33,207 --> 01:24:36,168
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

862
01:24:39,922 --> 01:24:42,216
There is no compassion
for traitors.

863
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,427
There is no mercy for traitors.

864
01:24:46,762 --> 01:24:49,015
He'll be court-martialled and shot.

865
01:24:50,975 --> 01:24:53,227
What good is that now?

866
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:56,814
It is my will!

867
01:25:10,202 --> 01:25:12,121
You're the Führer.

868
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:16,083
Go ahead.

869
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:19,587
The Russians are breaking through
everywhere.

870
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:23,299
There are no reserves left,
and air support has stopped.

871
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:26,052
There's no way
to bring in more ammunition.

872
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:32,683
The Russians have reached
Weidendammer Bridge,

873
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:36,854
Lustgarten to the east,
Potsdamer Platz to the south

874
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:38,522
and Tiergarten to the west,

875
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:41,025
300-400 metres
from the Chancellery.

876
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:43,527
How long can you hold out?

877
01:25:43,944 --> 01:25:45,446
One or two days at most.

878
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,615
The government district too?

879
01:25:47,782 --> 01:25:48,866
Yes, my Führer.

880
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:52,870
My Führer,
as a soldier I suggest

881
01:25:53,037 --> 01:25:55,122
we try to break through
the encirclement.

882
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,958
During the fight for Berlin

883
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,295
we've already lost
15-20,000 of the younger officers.

884
01:26:02,588 --> 01:26:04,507
But that's what young men are for.

885
01:26:06,258 --> 01:26:09,720
Your suggestion is absurd!
Insane!

886
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:13,307
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them now.

887
01:26:13,474 --> 01:26:14,475
My Führer...

888
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:18,145
...the orders are ready.
I give you my word--

889
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:21,065
The Führer can't just disappear
from history

890
01:26:21,565 --> 01:26:23,317
like some inglorious fugitive!

891
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:27,530
Even if we got out
successfully,

892
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:32,159
I'd only be escaping
one trap to fall into another.

893
01:26:32,326 --> 01:26:35,454
I'd have to sleep in the open air
or in a farmhouse

894
01:26:35,621 --> 01:26:39,875
or something similar
and wait for the end to come.

895
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:43,254
Wenck is approaching
with the 12th army.

896
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:46,257
He can unite
with Busse's 9th Army

897
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:51,137
and inflict a crushing blow
on the Russians to save us all.

898
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:54,807
Wenck is a man of excellence.

899
01:26:54,974 --> 01:26:56,642
Telegraph Keitel.

900
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:02,356
Report to me
immediately:

901
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,443
First, where are
Wenck's front lines?

902
01:27:06,026 --> 01:27:09,071
Second, when are they attacking?

903
01:27:09,238 --> 01:27:11,949
Third, where is the 9th Army?

904
01:27:12,116 --> 01:27:15,578
Fourth, where will the 9th Army
break through?

905
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,792
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be proved right.

906
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,463
Wenck will come.

907
01:27:31,677 --> 01:27:34,305
Wenck will come.

908
01:27:46,984 --> 01:27:51,405
I want to know if it's possible
for Wenck to attack or not.

909
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:56,785
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small force can attack the Red Army--

910
01:27:56,952 --> 01:27:59,121
How dare you say it's unlikely?

911
01:27:59,288 --> 01:28:01,874
Wenck has nothing
to confront the Red Army!

912
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:04,376
Why don't you tell the Führer?

913
01:28:04,793 --> 01:28:08,255
Have you all gone crazy?
- The Führer knows it himself!

914
01:28:08,422 --> 01:28:11,467
But he will never surrender!
And we won't either!

915
01:28:11,634 --> 01:28:14,261
I went through that before!
And once is enough!

916
01:28:14,428 --> 01:28:16,222
Come on.
I have to get out of here.

917
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:27,566
Stop.

918
01:28:40,037 --> 01:28:41,163
Heil Hitler!

919
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:33,424
Sorry, I fell asleep.

920
01:29:34,174 --> 01:29:36,510
So you rested up a bit, dear?

921
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:42,266
Take it in shorthand.

922
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:49,940
My political testament.

923
01:29:53,193 --> 01:29:57,740
Since 1914,
when I invested my modest strength

924
01:29:57,906 --> 01:30:02,202
in the First World War,
which was forced upon the Reich,

925
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:05,831
over 30 years have passed.

926
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:12,588
In those 3 decades, all my thoughts,
actions and my life

927
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:17,509
were dictated by my love for
and loyalty to the German people.

928
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,555
Sorry, but the heavy gunfire...

929
01:30:22,014 --> 01:30:23,641
You sit there.

930
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:30,731
Centuries will pass,

931
01:30:31,315 --> 01:30:34,652
but from the ruins of our cities
and cultural monuments

932
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:40,491
our hatred will be renewed
for those who are responsible,

933
01:30:41,742 --> 01:30:44,161
the people to whom we owe all this:

934
01:30:44,662 --> 01:30:48,540
The international Jewry
and its supporters.

935
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:01,011
What's wrong, Herr Minister?

936
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,518
Imagine!
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

937
01:31:08,936 --> 01:31:11,021
He ordered me to leave.

938
01:31:12,898 --> 01:31:16,193
I've never disobeyed
one of the Führer's orders. Never!

939
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,205
But I will not obey this order.

940
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:31,709
I will stand by the Führer.

941
01:31:34,878 --> 01:31:39,007
I'm sorry, Frau Junge, but...

942
01:31:39,341 --> 01:31:42,511
I have to dictate
my personal testament to you.

943
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:46,515
I'm typing the Führer's testament.

944
01:31:48,308 --> 01:31:49,518
Fine.

945
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:53,272
I understand.
I'll get back to you.

946
01:32:01,071 --> 01:32:05,075
My Führer, I...
The Race Laws require me

947
01:32:05,576 --> 01:32:10,122
to ask you this: My Führer,
are you of pure Aryan descent?

948
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:16,879
- Yes.
- May I see your ID?

949
01:32:18,422 --> 01:32:21,258
- You're talking to the Führer.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:32:22,009 --> 01:32:25,345
And are you,Fräulein Braun,
of pure Aryan descent?

951
01:32:25,512 --> 01:32:26,513
Yes.

952
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,766
Then the matter is...
There are no obstacles...

953
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:34,062
I ask you:
Do you, my Führer Adolf Hitler,

954
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:37,816
take Eva Braun
to be your lawful wedded wife?

955
01:32:37,941 --> 01:32:40,027
I do.

956
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:45,324
Do you, Eva Braun,
take the Führer Adolf Hitler

957
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,409
to be your lawful wedded husband?

958
01:32:48,744 --> 01:32:50,287
I do.

959
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:53,624
I hereby declare you
man and wife.

960
01:33:33,288 --> 01:33:34,998
I need two men!

961
01:33:37,042 --> 01:33:38,335
You'll be okay.

962
01:33:40,379 --> 01:33:43,340
- The Führer wants to see you at once.
- At this hour?

963
01:34:03,318 --> 01:34:04,695
How long can you hold out?

964
01:34:04,862 --> 01:34:07,364
Perhaps 20 hours.
No longer.

965
01:34:09,032 --> 01:34:11,743
The Russians are just
a few hundred metres away.

966
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:14,371
For the moment
we've stopped them.

967
01:34:14,705 --> 01:34:19,793
Know what, Mohnke?
The Western democracies are decadent.

968
01:34:20,544 --> 01:34:25,132
They will be defeated
by those disciplined people of the East.

969
01:34:28,886 --> 01:34:31,555
All the best. Thank you.

970
01:34:32,264 --> 01:34:34,892
It wasn't only for Germany.

971
01:34:55,996 --> 01:34:57,164
Keitel's report.

972
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:04,671
First, Wenck is stuck
south of Lake Schwielow.

973
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:08,884
Second, the 12th Army
cannot continue its assault on Berlin.

974
01:35:09,259 --> 01:35:13,388
Third, the bulk of the 9th Army
is encircled.

975
01:35:33,408 --> 01:35:38,789
My Führer, we need instructions
in case we run out of ammunition.

976
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:42,542
I will never surrender. Never.

977
01:35:44,419 --> 01:35:50,050
I forbid you to surrender.
That goes for every other commander as well.

978
01:36:01,561 --> 01:36:03,355
Listen, Gijnsche.

979
01:36:03,522 --> 01:36:08,819
Frau Braun...
my wife and I will commit suicide.

980
01:36:08,986 --> 01:36:12,698
But I don't want the Russians
to exhibit my body in some museum.

981
01:36:12,864 --> 01:36:15,492
Don't let me fall into their hands,
dead or alive!

982
01:36:16,076 --> 01:36:19,871
I want my body to be burned,
so it can never be found.

983
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:25,335
Gijnsche...

984
01:36:25,502 --> 01:36:30,048
Promise you will make
all necessary arrangements

985
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:33,176
for the disposal
of my mortal remains.

986
01:36:33,343 --> 01:36:34,678
My Führer...

987
01:36:36,513 --> 01:36:38,974
This is a terrible order,
but I will carry it out.

988
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:07,878
Kempka.

989
01:37:08,045 --> 01:37:10,338
Erich, I need 200 liters of gasoline.

990
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:12,382
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

991
01:37:12,549 --> 01:37:14,092
Where do I get that much gasoline?

992
01:37:14,259 --> 01:37:17,054
From the parked vehicles.
No one needs them now.

993
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,056
Why do you need so much gas?

994
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:20,766
I can't tell you on the phone.

995
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:38,575
Come with me, please.

996
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:40,744
The Führer wants to see us.

997
01:37:49,503 --> 01:37:51,379
Should I tell him
you can't come?

998
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:57,260
It's my pneumothorax.

999
01:37:58,095 --> 01:38:00,430
I won't last much longer anyway.

1000
01:38:46,309 --> 01:38:47,853
Excuse me, Madam.

1001
01:39:00,532 --> 01:39:02,659
This way, Professor.

1002
01:39:12,043 --> 01:39:13,378
Please wait here.

1003
01:39:23,013 --> 01:39:24,681
Excuse me...

1004
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,469
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

1005
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:07,224
My Führer, preserve our belief
in the final victory!

1006
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:12,479
Lead us, and we will follow you!

1007
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:17,400
Come on.

1008
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:27,035
Come in and join us!

1009
01:40:28,745 --> 01:40:31,581
- Sit down.
- Here, have a drink.

1010
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:36,711
- Drinking's all we have left.
- Have a seat.

1011
01:40:37,379 --> 01:40:38,672
That's better.

1012
01:40:39,673 --> 01:40:42,008
Yes sir, our situation is hopeless.

1013
01:40:42,175 --> 01:40:44,928
It's what you call shitty!

1014
01:40:48,598 --> 01:40:49,766
Be seated.

1015
01:40:50,225 --> 01:40:53,603
We are honoured,Fräulein...
Frau...

1016
01:40:53,937 --> 01:40:55,855
You may call me Frau Hitler.

1017
01:40:58,608 --> 01:41:00,485
Don't worry, it's all right.

1018
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:05,782
Pity we can't go outside anymore.

1019
01:41:06,116 --> 01:41:08,285
Only if you want a hero's death.

1020
01:41:09,703 --> 01:41:11,871
Fritz, pull yourself together!

1021
01:41:12,455 --> 01:41:15,458
Yes, sir!
Pull myself together!

1022
01:41:16,459 --> 01:41:17,460
Duck!

1023
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:31,057
That was a close call.

1024
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:37,314
Heil Hitler!

1025
01:41:39,441 --> 01:41:42,986
- ObersturmbannFührer, what's up?
- I must report to the Führer.

1026
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,030
Not now. Have a seat.

1027
01:41:45,655 --> 01:41:48,199
Sit down, drink up.

1028
01:41:52,037 --> 01:41:54,080
May I introduce you to Frau Hitler?

1029
01:41:55,332 --> 01:41:58,501
So young and so many medals!
You must be proud of yourself.

1030
01:42:01,755 --> 01:42:05,091
I must go.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

1031
01:42:05,258 --> 01:42:08,428
You can use our toilet.
Go ahead.

1032
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:20,857
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only destroy the optic nerve.

1033
01:42:21,858 --> 01:42:25,403
That's why it's advisable
to take poison too.

1034
01:42:27,405 --> 01:42:31,701
Pull the trigger
the moment you bite the capsule.

1035
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:34,788
Will I have enough time to do it?

1036
01:42:35,288 --> 01:42:38,083
The poison takes effect
after 1 or <i>2</i> seconds.

1037
01:42:55,642 --> 01:42:57,894
Kérner, you too.

1038
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:43,022
Frau Junge,
I've known him,

1039
01:43:43,773 --> 01:43:46,609
my husband,
for over 15 years.

1040
01:43:46,901 --> 01:43:50,905
But when I think about it,
I don't know anything about him.

1041
01:43:52,073 --> 01:43:53,950
Although he likes to talk.

1042
01:43:57,245 --> 01:43:58,955
I was looking forward to Berlin.

1043
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:02,000
But he's changed so much.

1044
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:05,837
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian meals.

1045
01:44:06,504 --> 01:44:09,174
I really hate Blondi.

1046
01:44:11,593 --> 01:44:16,556
Sometimes I kick her secretly,
then Adolf wonders about her behaviour.

1047
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:29,360
It seems he doesn't want anyone
to see inside him.

1048
01:44:30,528 --> 01:44:31,988
I mean deep inside.

1049
01:44:32,822 --> 01:44:37,410
In private, he can be
such a caring person.

1050
01:44:39,329 --> 01:44:44,167
But then he says...
such brutal things.

1051
01:44:44,626 --> 01:44:46,252
When he's the Führer?

1052
01:44:48,755 --> 01:44:51,257
Come on, let's have a smoke.

1053
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:14,948
I'm sorry.

1054
01:45:16,991 --> 01:45:20,328
You've so many worries,
and I sit here whining.

1055
01:45:22,372 --> 01:45:25,708
Frau Junge, let me give you this coat
as a going-away present.

1056
01:45:26,042 --> 01:45:30,922
I love well-dressed women.
I want you to have it and to enjoy it.

1057
01:45:32,382 --> 01:45:35,552
What a surprise. Thank you.

1058
01:45:36,594 --> 01:45:39,055
I have no idea
where and when I could wear it.

1059
01:45:42,016 --> 01:45:47,855
Please... try to get out of here.
Promise me.

1060
01:47:17,695 --> 01:47:23,076
Thank you, that was very good,
Fréulein Manziarly.

1061
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:45,390
The time has come.

1062
01:47:46,849 --> 01:47:48,184
It's over now.

1063
01:48:26,139 --> 01:48:28,224
The Führer wants to say farewell.

1064
01:49:00,757 --> 01:49:03,342
You're the bravest mother
in the whole Reich.

1065
01:49:03,968 --> 01:49:08,055
My Führer, you've made me
the happiest woman in Germany.

1066
01:49:32,955 --> 01:49:34,207
Give my regards to Bavaria.

1067
01:49:58,189 --> 01:50:00,733
Why are you here?

1068
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,486
We want to see Aunt Eva
and Uncle Hitler.

1069
01:50:04,529 --> 01:50:07,949
- Have you had anything to eat?
- Just breakfast.

1070
01:50:08,908 --> 01:50:12,161
I'll get you something to eat
and be right back, okay?

1071
01:50:12,328 --> 01:50:13,496
Okay.

1072
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:27,301
Comrades, have you heard
the latest news from outside?

1073
01:50:27,677 --> 01:50:32,181
Berlin's a city of warehouses.
Where's my house? Where's my house?

1074
01:50:37,812 --> 01:50:40,356
Herr Gijnsche,
I have to see the Führer.

1075
01:50:42,191 --> 01:50:43,734
Please!

1076
01:50:43,901 --> 01:50:46,863
The Führer does not want
to be disturbed by anyone.

1077
01:50:47,196 --> 01:50:49,615
Please, Gijnsche.
Just one moment.

1078
01:50:50,575 --> 01:50:51,784
Please!

1079
01:50:59,542 --> 01:51:01,752
My Führer,
Frau Goebbels is here.

1080
01:51:08,217 --> 01:51:09,468
What now?

1081
01:51:10,344 --> 01:51:14,432
My Führer,
I beg you to leave Berlin!

1082
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:16,851
My Führer, please...

1083
01:51:17,685 --> 01:51:21,355
Don't leave us!
What will become of us?

1084
01:51:24,901 --> 01:51:28,404
Tomorrow millions of people
will curse me,

1085
01:51:28,863 --> 01:51:31,115
but fate has taken its course.

1086
01:51:35,286 --> 01:51:37,705
Get up... Come on.

1087
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:41,292
Come on...

1088
01:51:50,426 --> 01:51:53,220
Aunt Traudl,
I really like those loud booms!

1089
01:51:54,305 --> 01:51:55,306
Why?

1090
01:51:55,473 --> 01:51:57,808
Nothing can happen to us here,
can it?

1091
01:51:57,975 --> 01:51:59,602
You're right.

1092
01:52:09,278 --> 01:52:10,738
Bull's eye!

1093
01:52:34,095 --> 01:52:37,223
Herr Reichsleiter,
it has happened.

1094
01:52:56,367 --> 01:52:57,952
The Führer is dead.

1095
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,720
There's Papa.

1096
01:53:28,315 --> 01:53:29,692
Are you crazy?

1097
01:53:29,859 --> 01:53:34,196
That gasoline has caused...
- Be quiet, Erich.

1098
01:53:44,415 --> 01:53:45,875
Step back!

1099
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:01,307
Come on!

1100
01:54:02,099 --> 01:54:03,476
Come on!

1101
01:55:30,104 --> 01:55:32,314
No! Don't!

1102
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:40,072
Let go of Grandma!

1103
01:55:46,078 --> 01:55:47,913
Order... Order...

1104
01:55:51,292 --> 01:55:53,085
Order must be restored!

1105
01:56:01,635 --> 01:56:03,345
Go after those two!

1106
01:56:07,975 --> 01:56:10,895
Here, this way!
We know our way through the ruins!

1107
01:56:11,061 --> 01:56:12,730
Trust us! Hurry!

1108
01:56:20,321 --> 01:56:23,032
I WAS ON THE SIDE
OF THE RED BEASTS

1109
01:56:26,577 --> 01:56:28,579
I SUPPORTED THE BOLSHEVIKS!

1110
01:56:36,837 --> 01:56:38,380
I hope the Russians got our message.

1111
01:56:38,547 --> 01:56:41,717
- We'll know in a minute.
- Or maybe not.

1112
01:56:47,139 --> 01:56:48,891
What news do you bring us, General?

1113
01:56:50,392 --> 01:56:55,481
Hitler and his wife committed suicide
in the Führer's bunker.

1114
01:56:58,734 --> 01:57:04,114
The new government has empowered me
to begin peace negotiations.

1115
01:57:09,328 --> 01:57:14,708
Between our two countries which have
suffered the highest casualties.

1116
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:18,128
General, would you want peace

1117
01:57:18,629 --> 01:57:20,714
in my position?

1118
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:22,925
My government will not accept

1119
01:57:23,259 --> 01:57:25,678
an unconditional surrender.

1120
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:29,848
Under the circumstances,

1121
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:32,559
there's no other alternative.

1122
01:57:35,271 --> 01:57:38,065
We'll never surrender! Outrageous!

1123
01:57:38,232 --> 01:57:41,610
I conquered Berlin against the Reds
years ago!

1124
01:57:41,777 --> 01:57:45,698
And I will defend it against the Reds
to my dying breath!

1125
01:57:46,407 --> 01:57:49,451
I won't use my final hours
as Reich Chancellor

1126
01:57:49,618 --> 01:57:54,331
to sign a statement of surrender!

1127
01:57:54,498 --> 01:57:57,626
- We must protect civilians!
- The Fiihrefls order is final!

1128
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:59,878
Have you gone mad?

1129
01:58:00,379 --> 01:58:01,505
We have to negotiate.

1130
01:58:02,423 --> 01:58:04,591
I repeat, gentlemen,

1131
01:58:05,092 --> 01:58:07,845
I will never agree to surrender!
- Telegraph Marshal Schukov.

1132
01:58:08,012 --> 01:58:10,055
- Marshal Schukov?
- What's going on?

1133
01:58:10,222 --> 01:58:12,641
This is crazy!
We must surrender to the Russians!

1134
01:58:12,808 --> 01:58:14,059
I'll shoot you!

1135
01:58:14,226 --> 01:58:16,854
The Führer forbade
any kind of surrender!

1136
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:39,501
- How long does it last?
- About 4 hours.

1137
01:59:16,955 --> 01:59:18,374
Alright, children.

1138
01:59:18,874 --> 01:59:21,710
Dr. Stumpfegger has brought
the medicine I told you about.

1139
01:59:21,877 --> 01:59:24,588
It's bitter,
but it's good for you.

1140
01:59:26,256 --> 01:59:27,674
Everyone gets a sip.

1141
01:59:29,385 --> 01:59:31,387
Who's first?

1142
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:36,392
Heide, you're always so brave.

1143
01:59:43,732 --> 01:59:45,317
One more sip.

1144
01:59:48,404 --> 01:59:50,239
It wasn't that bad.

1145
01:59:55,911 --> 01:59:58,288
Good... Helmut?

1146
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:02,042
Good.

1147
02:00:02,209 --> 02:00:05,462
It will keep you from getting sick
in this damp bunker.

1148
02:00:05,629 --> 02:00:08,090
But it isn't damp here.

1149
02:00:13,053 --> 02:00:14,638
Good, good.

1150
02:00:24,273 --> 02:00:25,441
Helga...

1151
02:00:28,277 --> 02:00:29,528
I don't want any.

1152
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,864
Do you want to get sick?

1153
02:00:32,573 --> 02:00:35,033
Please, Mama. I don't want to.

1154
02:00:39,913 --> 02:00:42,666
Don't cry.
It won't help if you cry.

1155
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:44,960
You have to drink it.

1156
02:00:49,548 --> 02:00:50,591
Helga!

1157
02:00:54,928 --> 02:00:58,807
Come on! Open your mouth!

1158
02:00:58,974 --> 02:00:59,975
Papa!

1159
02:01:01,268 --> 02:01:02,394
Now.

1160
02:01:03,812 --> 02:01:05,063
Drink, drink.

1161
02:01:19,912 --> 02:01:21,830
Sleep tight, children.

1162
02:01:32,299 --> 02:01:35,302
The lies will one day vanish,

1163
02:01:35,636 --> 02:01:38,347
and light will brighten
the darkness.

1164
02:01:39,097 --> 02:01:41,475
Would you read it to me, please?

1165
02:01:42,434 --> 02:01:46,480
"The lies will one day vanish,
and light will brighten the darkness."

1166
02:01:48,106 --> 02:01:49,149
Let's do it again.

1167
02:01:49,858 --> 02:01:53,070
The lies will one day vanish,
and above them...

1168
02:01:54,196 --> 02:01:56,698
...truth will once again triumph.

1169
02:01:57,282 --> 02:02:00,577
It will be the moment
when we stand above everything,

1170
02:02:01,203 --> 02:02:02,996
pure and...

1171
02:02:06,875 --> 02:02:08,293
...unblemished.

1172
02:06:15,707 --> 02:06:19,252
- We don't stand a chance.
- I don't care. I want out.

1173
02:06:19,586 --> 02:06:21,004
How do we cross the Russian lines?

1174
02:06:21,171 --> 02:06:23,882
I won't stay a minute longer.

1175
02:06:24,049 --> 02:06:27,469
- We're gonna die!
- Stop it! It won't be so bad.

1176
02:06:28,261 --> 02:06:29,971
The Russians will get us if we stay.

1177
02:06:35,393 --> 02:06:36,937
Okay, let's go.

1178
02:08:05,442 --> 02:08:12,198
On April 30th 1945,
the Führer committed suicide.

1179
02:08:12,616 --> 02:08:18,496
Thus he abandoned all those
who had pledged allegiance to him.

1180
02:08:18,914 --> 02:08:23,960
<i>German soldiers, you obeyed
the Führer's orders and were prepared</i>

1181
02:08:24,836 --> 02:08:27,255
<i>to continue the battle for Berlin,</i>

1182
02:08:27,631 --> 02:08:30,550
<i>although you were running out
of ammunition</i>

1183
02:08:30,717 --> 02:08:35,013
<i>and further resistance was futile.</i>

1184
02:08:36,973 --> 02:08:40,560
<i>I order an immediate ceasefire.</i>

1185
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:46,316
<i>Every further hour of battle
will only prolong</i>

1186
02:08:46,483 --> 02:08:48,902
<i>the civilians' terrible suffering</i>

1187
02:08:49,069 --> 02:08:51,071
<i>and the suffering of our wounded.</i>

1188
02:08:51,988 --> 02:08:56,284
<i>In agreement with the Soviet Army
Supreme Command,</i>

1189
02:08:56,451 --> 02:09:01,748
<i>I order you
to cease fighting at once!</i>

1190
02:09:02,374 --> 02:09:05,961
Weidling,
former Commanding Officer

1191
02:09:06,294 --> 02:09:09,589
of the Berlin Defense Force.

1192
02:09:11,508 --> 02:09:13,259
A glass of water, please.

1193
02:10:19,367 --> 02:10:20,869
I no longer need you.

1194
02:10:24,956 --> 02:10:26,541
The die is cast.

1195
02:11:35,276 --> 02:11:38,780
- It's time, Doctor.
- You see how busy we are.

1196
02:11:38,947 --> 02:11:40,573
I insist that you accompany us.

1197
02:11:42,951 --> 02:11:44,160
So that's it.

1198
02:11:52,127 --> 02:11:56,548
Go on. You've done a great deal.
Thank you.

1199
02:12:04,597 --> 02:12:05,890
Schédle, come with me.

1200
02:12:06,057 --> 02:12:09,477
Sorry, I'm not going anywhere.

1201
02:12:12,021 --> 02:12:13,231
<i>Let's gm!</i>

1202
02:13:32,101 --> 02:13:37,273
Sturmmann Krijger gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class, for defending Wolf Bridge.

1203
02:13:38,858 --> 02:13:40,944
Sturmmann Wagner
took out 2 machine-gun posts

1204
02:13:41,110 --> 02:13:43,571
and defended Puttkammer Strasse.

1205
02:13:43,905 --> 02:13:46,199
He gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class.

1206
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:49,744
Sturmmann Rauch
gets the Iron Cross

1207
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:53,915
for helping messengers
get through enemy lines.

1208
02:14:25,405 --> 02:14:26,531
The others!

1209
02:14:32,245 --> 02:14:33,705
Oh, God!

1210
02:14:36,708 --> 02:14:38,084
Get outta here! Hurry!

1211
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:44,132
Help!

1212
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:56,936
Who goes there?

1213
02:15:04,861 --> 02:15:06,154
A German.

1214
02:15:11,826 --> 02:15:12,869
Herr Hewel?

1215
02:15:15,413 --> 02:15:18,833
Hewel, thank God you're alive.

1216
02:15:21,753 --> 02:15:23,254
Where are the others?

1217
02:15:26,132 --> 02:15:30,136
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere... perhaps.

1218
02:15:30,303 --> 02:15:32,722
I'm sure most of the people
in my group are dead.

1219
02:15:34,349 --> 02:15:36,642
I never should have left the bunker.

1220
02:15:37,769 --> 02:15:39,771
I should have shot myself.

1221
02:15:41,189 --> 02:15:42,565
But I couldn't.

1222
02:15:44,108 --> 02:15:47,236
Eat something.
There's time enough to die.

1223
02:16:37,412 --> 02:16:38,413
Attention!

1224
02:16:44,919 --> 02:16:46,421
Stay with the women.

1225
02:16:48,005 --> 02:16:49,298
Come here.

1226
02:17:02,019 --> 02:17:03,604
The Russians have us surrounded.

1227
02:17:04,313 --> 02:17:05,398
What will we do?

1228
02:17:06,691 --> 02:17:08,860
You can try to get through.

1229
02:17:09,819 --> 02:17:11,320
I'm not taking another step.

1230
02:17:12,864 --> 02:17:16,617
Think it over.
The Russians are only after us.

1231
02:17:17,493 --> 02:17:19,287
As women, you have a chance.

1232
02:17:20,621 --> 02:17:22,123
Give it a try.

1233
02:17:23,916 --> 02:17:25,418
Good luck.

1234
02:17:28,296 --> 02:17:31,591
When you go past the Russians,
don't look anybody in the eye.

1235
02:17:32,633 --> 02:17:33,885
Don't forget.

1236
02:17:34,677 --> 02:17:35,970
Good luck.

1237
02:17:45,146 --> 02:17:46,772
The Russians!

1238
02:17:58,826 --> 02:18:00,077
Let's go.

1239
02:18:00,244 --> 02:18:01,454
Go ahead.

1240
02:18:02,997 --> 02:18:04,707
I can't go on.
- Please.

1241
02:18:07,668 --> 02:18:08,669
I have to try.

1242
02:18:10,171 --> 02:18:12,006
Don't be angry with me.

1243
02:18:16,135 --> 02:18:17,428
I'll manage.

1244
02:18:30,942 --> 02:18:32,026
Doctor!

1245
02:18:34,862 --> 02:18:37,740
My comrades want to surrender
to the Russians. May I join you?

1246
02:18:37,907 --> 02:18:41,661
The Führer is dead.
You want to fight the war alone?

1247
02:18:42,161 --> 02:18:43,829
I feel committed to my oath.

1248
02:18:44,747 --> 02:18:48,459
Then talk to the BrigadeFührer.

1249
02:19:17,738 --> 02:19:18,823
The Russians are clearing the area.

1250
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:20,992
- Yes?
- No resistance.

1251
02:19:21,158 --> 02:19:24,203
No shots have been fired.
- They'll be here in an hour.

1252
02:19:26,038 --> 02:19:28,332
What should we do?

1253
02:19:28,499 --> 02:19:30,710
Our honour won't allow us
to surrender!

1254
02:19:30,876 --> 02:19:32,920
What does that mean?

1255
02:19:33,087 --> 02:19:36,924
When the Russians come,
we fire until we're out of bullets.

1256
02:19:37,091 --> 02:19:39,010
Then we blow our brains out.

1257
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:41,345
Rubbish!

1258
02:19:41,512 --> 02:19:46,434
Is this murderous, suicidal killing
for the sake of prestige the only way out?

1259
02:19:46,601 --> 02:19:49,937
We're SS officers.
We can't outlive the Führer's death!

1260
02:19:50,938 --> 02:19:52,356
Who else feels that way?

1261
02:21:41,048 --> 02:21:44,760
- Want to sit with me a moment?
- I'd love to.

1262
02:21:49,974 --> 02:21:51,517
Why do you want to go on living?

1263
02:21:52,351 --> 02:21:55,521
And why do you want to die?

1264
02:21:57,022 --> 02:21:58,065
See this?

1265
02:21:59,817 --> 02:22:02,069
The Führer himself
gave it to me.

1266
02:22:03,195 --> 02:22:04,739
A final decoration?

1267
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:09,160
Perhaps. Hitler gave it to me
at his farewell.

1268
02:22:10,661 --> 02:22:12,121
He made me swear a vow.

1269
02:22:12,288 --> 02:22:17,418
That I would kill myself
the moment the Russians captured me.

1270
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:21,464
Hitler made you promise
to kill yourself.

1271
02:22:22,757 --> 02:22:23,883
BUT Why?

1272
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:29,764
He probably didn't want me
to be forced to speak negatively of him.

1273
02:22:29,930 --> 02:22:34,059
But as a diplomat, you are protected
by international law.

1274
02:22:35,144 --> 02:22:37,897
Who will benefit
if you keep your promise?

1275
02:22:38,981 --> 02:22:39,982
They're here!

1276
02:22:53,996 --> 02:22:55,706
Don't shoot, comrades!

1277
02:22:59,251 --> 02:23:00,669
We have surrendered.

1278
02:23:02,129 --> 02:23:03,422
The war is over.

1279
02:23:04,965 --> 02:23:06,258
It's over.

1280
02:27:21,889 --> 02:27:26,935
Of course, the terrible things
I heard from the Nuremberg Trials

1281
02:27:27,269 --> 02:27:33,567
about the 6 million Jews
and the people of other races

1282
02:27:33,734 --> 02:27:40,240
who were killed were facts
that shocked me deeply.

1283
02:27:41,158 --> 02:27:45,871
But I wasn't able to see
the connection with my own past.

1284
02:27:46,205 --> 02:27:51,251
I was satisfied
that I wasn't personally to blame

1285
02:27:51,418 --> 02:27:54,588
and that I hadn't known
about those things.

1286
02:27:54,755 --> 02:27:57,174
I wasn't aware of the extent.

1287
02:27:57,508 --> 02:28:03,347
But one day I went past
the memorial plaque

1288
02:28:04,473 --> 02:28:08,435
which had been put up for
Sophie Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse,

1289
02:28:08,602 --> 02:28:12,064
and I saw that she was born
the same year as me,

1290
02:28:12,231 --> 02:28:17,861
and she was executed the same year
I started working for Hitler.

1291
02:28:18,987 --> 02:28:23,450
And at that moment
I actually sensed

1292
02:28:23,784 --> 02:28:27,621
that it was no excuse to be young,

1293
02:28:27,955 --> 02:28:32,876
and that it would have been possible
to find things out.
