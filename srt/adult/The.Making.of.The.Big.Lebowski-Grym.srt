1
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,505
Where's the money, Lebowski?

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,275
The Big Lebowski is about a
character named Jeff Lebowski,

3
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,575
played by Jeff Bridges,

4
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,675
this sort of aging pothead
who lives in Los Angeles

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,415
and who becomes the victim
of a case of mistaken identity

6
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,253
just because he happens
to have the same name

7
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,759
as a millionaire
who lives out in Pasadena.

8
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:55,097
And by virtue of that, he's thrust into
this intrigue surrounding a kidnapping

9
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,260
involving
the millionaire's wife.

10
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,235
<i>The Big Lebowski
started, really,</i>

11
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:04,207
with us thinking about
a friend of ours

12
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,575
in Los Angeles,

13
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:13,016
who the character that Jeff Bridges
plays is sort of loosely based on.

14
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,384
This is a guy who we've
known for about 15 years,

15
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,453
who actually
does call himself the Dude,

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,430
and it was imagining him

17
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:30,367
in the context of
a Chandler kind of a story

18
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,563
that got us started
on the script.

19
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,600
It just seemed interesting to
us to thrust that character

20
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:41,237
into the most confusing
situation possible,

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,407
the person, it would seem
on the face of it,

22
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,883
least equipped to deal with it.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,250
That's sort of
the conceit of the movie.

24
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,915
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,088
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

26
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:57,152
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

27
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,663
So that's what you call me.
You know?

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,497
That, or His Dudeness, or Duder,

29
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,937
or, you know, El Duderino, if you're
not into the whole brevity thing.

30
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,066
Are you employed, sir?

31
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,304
Employed?

32
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,740
The Dude, who is...

33
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,850
He's better known as the Dude, but
his real name is Jeff Lebowski,

34
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,947
and he gets confused
with another Lebowski,

35
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,358
a fellow who's...

36
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,990
You know,
a lot wealthier fellow.

37
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:35,932
And he gets
mixed up for this guy,

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,995
and all kind of hell
and confusion breaks loose.

39
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,300
"We have Bunny."

40
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,470
LEBOWSKI: ...written by men who were unable
to achieve on a level field of play.

41
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,606
"Gather $1 million..."
Cowards!

42
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,982
"...in unmarked, non-consecutive 20s."
Weaklings!

43
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,750
"Await instructions. No funny stuff." 
Bums!

44
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,052
Bummer.

45
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,183
This is definitely
the Dude we wanted.

46
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,593
I think he did have
a good time making the movie.

47
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,528
He got to eat
whatever he wanted.

48
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,622
Yeah.

49
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,894
I mean, it was clear to Jeff

50
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:14,133
that the character wasn't into the Los
Angeles health, fitness and beauty,

51
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,003
and that he could
let himself go,

52
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,840
which he probably kind of
enjoyed, even just for that.

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,901
Yeah, and he really...

54
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,177
Yeah, one thing he did take from the
real character, the real Dude, is...

55
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,742
You know, the real Dude is quite
overweight, and I think...

56
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,582
Jeff met him once, and I think
he looked at him and went,

57
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:37,687
“Okay, I can kind of let my
waistline go for this part."

58
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,022
<i>But all Jeff wanted to know...
Actually, pretty consistently,</i>

59
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,194
Jeff Bridges, at the beginning of
the start of shooting every scene,

60
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,999
he'd walk up
to one or the other of us

61
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,771
and ask if we figured whether or not
the Dude burned one on the way over.

62
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,540
Yeah, "So do you think the Dude
burned one on the way over?"

63
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,601
So we'd think about it.

64
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,147
Usually we'd say, "Yeah, he probably
burned one on the way over,"

65
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,515
and Jeff would go
over in the corner,

66
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,150
rub his knuckles in his eyes
to turn them red

67
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,314
and do the scene, and that
was kind of the extent

68
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,382
of what you had to do
to direct Jeff. Yeah.

69
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,923
Some actors like talking
about it more than others.

70
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,629
(SIRENS APPROACHING)
No, you're not wrong.

71
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,496
Am I wrong?
You're not wrong, Walter.

72
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,862
You're just an asshole.

73
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,368
Okay, then.

74
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,871
Play Quintana and O'Brien next week.
They should be pushovers.

75
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,904
Man, would you just...
Just take it easy, man.

76
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,909
In this one,
in this particular case,

77
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,849
the story was very loosely based

78
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:37,252
on the narrative structure
of a Chandler novel. You know?

79
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:40,918
And those novels
are very episodic in nature.

80
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,824
They usually follow
the main character

81
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,923
as he encounters
these different characters

82
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:52,198
on a journey to uncover a mystery
or find a missing person

83
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,432
or whatever it may be
in the novel.

84
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,936
So that was sort of the...

85
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,741
In this case, that was sort
of the model for the story.

86
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,147
In each movie, it's a little bit
different in terms of where the...

87
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:10,279
Actually, the one case where it got,
just in terms of plot, most involved

88
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,722
and most difficult
for us to manage

89
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,124
<i>was Miller's Crossing,</i>
which <i>was</i> a <i>gangster movie,</i>

90
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,356
sort of a homage,

91
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,422
or a rip-off, depending on
your point of view,

92
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,933
of Dashiell Hammett.

93
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,435
And that got very...

94
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:30,032
Just in the sense of the convolution
of the plot, got very involved,

95
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,067
and that was sort of,
as I say, difficult to manage.

96
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:37,013
This one, yeah, not as much.
It was partly...

97
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,640
In this one, we sort of figured,

98
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,810
if things become
a little bit too complicated

99
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,547
and are unclear,
it really doesn't matter.

100
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,350
I mean, the plot is not the...

101
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,457
And, again,
this is similar to Chandler.

102
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,891
The plot is sort of secondary

103
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,362
to the other things that are
going on in the piece, I think.

104
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,990
And if people get
a little bit confused,

105
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,763
it's, I don't think,
really necessarily

106
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,532
going to get in the way
of them enjoying the movie.

107
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,366
Yeah, you look at something
like The <i>Big</i> Sleep,

108
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,038
and nobody seemed to know,
including the people who wrote it,

109
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,877
what the hell was going on
in that plot either, so...

110
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,777
The hero, the Dude,
is not a private eye,

111
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,083
but he's
really a guy who's a throwback

112
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,954
to the characters of...

113
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,820
You know, early '70s,
late '60s kind of guy.

114
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,231
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

115
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,462
Dude.

116
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,061
Oh, I don't know, sir.

117
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,199
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,

118
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,277
whatever the cost?

119
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,473
Isn't that what makes a man?

120
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,314
Sure.
That and a pair of testicles.

121
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,383
Sam Elliott
would actually ask us for...

122
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,947
Like, "What am I doing
in this movie?"

123
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,892
Yeah, Sam would say, "I don't
know what I'm doing here, boys.

124
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,520
"Happy to be here,
don't get me wrong, but..."

125
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,828
We didn't have anything to tell Sam.
We didn't know either.

126
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,896
But, you know, didn't
hurt his performance any.

127
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,502
How're you doing there, Dude?

128
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,636
Not too good, man.

129
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,774
One of those days, huh?

130
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:12,936
Yeah.

131
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:18,544
Well, a wiser fellow
than myself once said,

132
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,779
"Sometimes you eat the bear,
and..."

133
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,321
Much obliged.

134
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,690
"Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you."

135
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,195
That some kind of Eastern thing?

136
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,489
Far from it.

137
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,300
I like your style, Dude.

138
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,374
We really wrote that part for
Sam 'cause we like his voice.

139
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,776
You know,
he's got that really...

140
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,213
I mean, he really
can hit that lower register.

141
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,217
Also, he's got that
really big mustache,

142
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,844
so when you're cutting the movie,
you can move his lines around,

143
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,479
cheat them
into his mouth wherever.

144
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,285
<i>ETHAN: You know,
you can never see his lips.</i>

145
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,883
<i>It's</i> a <i>good thing about
working with Sam Elliott.</i>

146
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,554
Walter's kind of an
interesting character for me.

147
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,031
I'm trying to do justice to him.

148
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,331
He was written so wonderfully.

149
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,600
He's head of
a security agency, his own.

150
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,841
I think he gets by all right.

151
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,914
Doesn't really... The most
nattily dressed fellow in town.

152
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,439
He's got his own agenda.
He was...

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,477
He's got an Army background,

154
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:35,016
and that's his career, is reminding
people of his service in Vietnam.

155
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,428
He means well,
but he is a little oafish.

156
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,996
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

157
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,197
Whose toe was it, Walter?

158
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,603
How should I know?

159
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,140
I do know that nothing about
it indicates that it was her...

160
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,575
The nail polish, Walter!

161
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,168
Fine, Dude.

162
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,704
As if it's impossible to get some nail
polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

163
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,079
Someone else...
Pinking shears.

164
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,641
Where the...
Are they gonna get...

165
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,313
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

166
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,481
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

167
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,622
You don't wanna know
about it. Believe me.

168
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,681
Yeah, but, Walter...

169
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,459
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00
this afternoon, with nail polish.

170
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,827
Yeah, we wrote the Walter part
for John, who...

171
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,356
I guess this is the third
movie we've done with him.

172
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,363
And...

173
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,707
Well, actually, as we wrote the part
that Turturro plays for Turturro

174
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,247
and the part that
Steve Buscemi plays for Steve.

175
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,183
So those parts were essentially
written for those actors.

176
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,750
Were you listening
to the Dude's story, Donny?

177
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,775
What?
Walter...

178
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,379
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling.

179
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,447
So you have no frame
of reference here, Donny.

180
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,959
You're like a child who wanders
into the middle of a movie

181
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,155
and wants to know...
Walter, what's the point, man?

182
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,896
There's no reason...
Here's my point, Dude.

183
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,397
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

184
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,729
Yeah, Walter, what's your point?

185
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,735
Walter, what is the...

186
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,499
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

187
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:59,203
We saw John Turturro
play an Hispanic character

188
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,940
in a play
at the Public Theater about...

189
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,681
Must be about
11 or 12 years ago.

190
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,509
And ever since then, we've wanted
to write something for him

191
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,146
where he plays
an Hispanic character.

192
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:16,459
And this just seemed like
the right opportunity for it.

193
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,927
<i>JOEL: I mean...</i>

194
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,430
<i>And then, to really give him
something to sink his teeth into,</i>

195
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,400
<i>we made him</i> a <i>child molester.</i>

196
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,825
But...

197
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,242
I think it's really a
pretty vivid characterization

198
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,744
given the amount of screen
time he has, don't you think?

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,338
Yeah. Yeah. John goes
to the core of things.

200
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,862
The characters were conceived
as being

201
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,268
partners in
a dysfunctional marriage.

202
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,109
The Jeff Bridges and John
Goodman character, they were...

203
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,209
And at the point where we
were writing the script,

204
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:16,084
we sort of conceived them
in the sense that...

205
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,358
You know, designed them so
that they would be able to...

206
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,792
Or constantly would be
pushing each other's buttons

207
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,423
in terms of
those kinds of reactions,

208
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,127
you know, the sort of getting
on each other's nerves

209
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,366
and yet, still, at a certain
level, really liking each other.

210
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,901
One of the things that Jeff,
I think...

211
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,470
It's interesting, because one of the
things that Jeff sort of came to

212
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,744
while we were rehearsing,
before we started shooting,

213
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,684
was he conceived
the character, appropriately,

214
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,313
as being very mellow
and laid-back,

215
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,450
and yet, in practically
every scene in the movie,

216
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,255
he ends up exploding

217
00:11:56,316 --> 00:12:00,958
because of what Walter is doing
or saying or making happen.

218
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,864
And that was something
he hadn't associated,

219
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,267
on the first reading in the
script, with the character,

220
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,739
but is very much a part of how
they, the two characters,

221
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,466
relate to each other.

222
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,968
It's a definite buddy movie.

223
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,973
That's what I love about it,
and...

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,049
The dialogue's
just funnier than hell.

225
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,919
I mean, it's one of those
where you crack the page

226
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,650
and you start laughing
every two pages,

227
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,124
and enough where you gotta
sit for five minutes

228
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,751
and then you can
pick it up again.

229
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:30,817
Walter, I love you,

230
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,428
but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact

231
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,056
you're a goddamn moron.

232
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,122
No time to argue.
Hey, man...

233
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,226
The bridge.
Hey, Walter... Hey, Walter!

234
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,827
Hey, Walter...

235
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,668
WALTER: Here goes the ringer!

236
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,204
What the fuck?
Okay, Dude, your wheel.

237
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,505
Hey, man... What the fuck!
At 15 m.p.h., I roll out.

238
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,511
I double back, grab one of
them and beat it out of him.

239
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,775
The Uzi.
Uzi?

240
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,947
You didn't think I was rolling
out of here naked, did you?

241
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,383
Walter, please! Fifteen, Dude!
Let's take that hill!

242
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,442
Walter!

243
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,842
(MAN IN ME PLAYING)

244
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,568
We've done four movies

245
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,905
with Roger Deakins
as the cinematographer.

246
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,475
<i>JOEL: Well, it's funny.
We met Roger...</i>

247
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,305
Specifically, the way we
started working with Roger is,

248
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,215
when we did Barton <i>Fink,</i>

249
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,720
we were shooting a movie
in Los Angeles,

250
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,946
non-union,

251
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,089
and for that reason, we...

252
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,253
But on the other hand,

253
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,663
we wanted to work with someone
whose work we knew and liked,

254
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,066
as opposed to someone
who was just starting out.

255
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,662
And that meant a foreign DP

256
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,073
who wasn't in the unions
in the United States.

257
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,610
So we went...

258
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,341
We'd seen Roger's work, I
think, on a number of things,

259
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,646
but in particular Mike
Figgis' movie Stormy Monday,

260
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,653
I think was the last one we'd
seen before we talked to him.

261
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,657
And we met Roger and liked him
and hired him to do that movie,

262
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,750
and we've been
working together since then.

263
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,659
You know, Roger's just...

264
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:51,100
He's one of the top three
or four DPs

265
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,068
working in the world
right now, I think.

266
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,403
He's like... There's nobody
better than Roger.

267
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,903
And just personally,
we get along really well.

268
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,210
So it's been
a good collaboration.

269
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,283
<i>ETHAN: Yeah, Julianne Moore ls really good.
Yeah, It wasn't meant to</i> be...

270
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,583
<i>It isn't specifically English,
the accent.</i>

271
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,214
<i>It's some vague,
non-specific geographically,</i>

272
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,559
“swell finishing school for girls
in Switzerland," maybe, accent

273
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,863
that she came up with.

274
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:29,371
Yeah, she just read the script
and sort of intuitively grasped

275
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:34,502
that there should be something
horribly regal about the character.

276
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,480
She's very funny.

277
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:42,409
Julianne Moore plays a wonderful
avant-garde artist who specializes in

278
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,758
some sort of feminist art. I
couldn't really put my finger on it.

279
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,423
Yeah,
something to do with women.

280
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,960
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

281
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,194
Excuse me?

282
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,033
Sex. The physical act of love.
Coitus. Do you like it?

283
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,207
I was talking about my rug.

284
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,139
You're not interested in sex?

285
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,004
You mean coitus?

286
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,170
I like it too.

287
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,510
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

288
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,016
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

289
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,551
However, there are some people,

290
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,554
it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women,

291
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,853
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

292
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,948
Oh, no.

293
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,550
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

294
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,561
Well, movies always
get weird reactions.

295
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,464
Like, some people, some
journalists we talk to, say,

296
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,797
"Well? So how did you come up
with the story?

297
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,963
"Just sit around
and smoke a lot of pot?"

298
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,205
It was really strange. We got
that from one journalist.

299
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,436
Then, when we were doing
an interview in Germany,

300
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,205
a German journalist asked us,

301
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,744
"So how do you
come up with the story?

302
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,647
"You sit around in a room
and drink a lot of beer?"

303
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,311
(SNORTS)

304
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,357
I'm throwing rocks tonight.

305
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,359
<i>JOEL: Steve doesn't say much
in the movie. He...</i>

306
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,761
<i>Well, we thought it would
be interesting after...</i>

307
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:04,165
You know, he plays sort of a motor mouth in Fargo.
He never really shuts up.

308
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:09,332
And so we thought it would be interesting
to go the other way in this movie

309
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,205
in terms of the character
that we wrote for him.

310
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,541
Somebody pointed out
to us recently

311
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,343
that he's been in
the past five movies of ours

312
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,213
and we've killed him
in each one.

313
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,446
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what the...
Yeah. I don't know why.

314
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,824
In progressively more
gruesome ways, too, actually.

315
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,454
Well, not that his death in this
one is particularly gruesome,

316
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,623
not to reveal too much.

317
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:39,568
But his remains seem to get smaller
and smaller in each of our movies.

318
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,462
I don't know what we'll do next.

319
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,169
No, don't do...

320
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,803
Not on the rug, man.

321
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,879
The carpet.
You know, it's interesting,

322
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,043
we just got a call
from <i>Floor Covering Weekly,</i>

323
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,213
a magazine to the trade
about floor coverings,

324
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,314
<i>that wanted to do a story
on The Big Lebowski</i>

325
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,225
because catalyst for the story
was the floor covering.

326
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,058
So we did a really long...

327
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,598
We were so excited about being
on Floor Covering Weekly

328
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,897
that we did a really long interview with the woman.
She was really taken aback.

329
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,468
It was the one time
we've talked to a journalist

330
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,494
where they were anxious
to get off the phone

331
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,508
and were just humoring us as we
mattered on about the carpet

332
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,874
and all the other
floor coverings in the movie.

333
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,311
And she promised to send us
a copy of the magazine,

334
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,349
but it hasn't materialized yet.

335
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,386
Yeah, it's hard to believe that there's
actually a weekly about floor covering.

336
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,321
Yeah, how much is there to say?
'Cause that's...

337
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,517
And you would think,
by virtue of that,

338
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,992
she would be interested
in a lot of material

339
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,962
about the movie.
Filling some pages. Yeah.

340
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,431
We even offered to pose for
her if she'd do a cover.

341
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,935
Pose for a cover picture, the two
of us in front of the Persian carpet

342
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,666
which Jeff Bridges' character
appropriates.

343
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,732
And she was sort of polite,
but declined.

344
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,969
Then we started
getting suspicious

345
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,513
that maybe the whole thing
had been a hoax

346
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,709
and she wasn't actually
a legitimate representative

347
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,251
<i>from Floor Covering Weekly,</i>

348
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,379
but some journalist who'd been
turned down for an interview

349
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,854
in another context.

350
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,453
But, yeah, it is true that the movie does...
The catalyst for the plot...

351
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:16,057
The whole beginning
of the movie has to do

352
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:20,593
with a rug being soiled in a
sort of very particular way.

353
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,936
And the main character's
journey through the movie

354
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,968
is an attempt to get redress
for his soiled rug.

355
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,551
That, also, was loosely taken
from real life.

356
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,252
One of the characters
that the movie was based on

357
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,631
used to have a rug that he'd, I think,
salvaged out of the trash from somewhere,

358
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,793
that he would go on and on about
how it tied the room together

359
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,336
in his little apartment.

360
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,873
So, yeah, the rug became
a very important element.

361
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,078
Yeah, then it just
seemed to take off.

362
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,741
Actually, literally.

363
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,945
I mean, we got into the whole flying
carpet, Thief of Bagdad thing

364
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,814
<i>with one of his
pothead hallucinations.</i>

365
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,291
We gave the script
to Joel Silver, the producer,

366
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,453
who gave us
a really interesting note

367
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,396
which we actually ignored
but maybe shouldn't have.

368
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,300
He said that the movie should have
ended with him getting his rug back

369
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,361
or some mention of the rug, which
would have been a nice resolution,

370
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,033
but we never did do it.

371
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,304
<i>(JUST DROPPED IN PLAYING)</i>

372
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,276
We thought we could do many
of those shots practically,

373
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,041
the shots where
we don't see Jeff full-figure,

374
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,175
floating between the girls'
legs in the bowling alley.

375
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,653
<i>But actually,
the human body is such</i>

376
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,384
that Jeff's shoulders
are just a little too broad

377
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,926
and the girls, though they
were cast to be tall,

378
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,087
were just not tall enough,

379
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,995
so that Jeff couldn't actually
fit between their legs.

380
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,363
They had to be shot
in separate passes.

381
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,564
There was a pass of the camera
tracking past the girls' legs

382
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:40,407
and then a shot of Jeff being
propelled over the bowling alley.

383
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,434
And they had to be composited
in a computer

384
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,981
with Jeff shrunk very slightly

385
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,211
so that he could, indeed,
plausibly pass between their legs

386
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:52,051
but not shrunk to the extent
that you'd notice.

387
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,426
But, yeah,
all those shots of Jeff

388
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,793
with the dancing girls
in the Busby Berkeley sequence

389
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,526
are composited in a computer.

390
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,165
So they were shot separately.

391
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,136
The shots where the camera
actually goes through the legs

392
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:16,670
were shot practically, on a
stage, just with a camera on a...

393
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,273
Well, we did it two ways.

394
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,944
We had a little skateboard,
essentially,

395
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,180
that the camera sat on,
that was sent down...

396
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,655
With a motor on it, and the camera was...
You could...

397
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,022
Sent down between their legs,

398
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,551
and it was controlled by an
operator with a joystick.

399
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,965
It's similar to a device that
we used in the bowling alley

400
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,127
where we would chase the bowling
balls down the bowling lane.

401
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,570
<i>This little motorized
skateboard with</i> a <i>camera on it</i>

402
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,904
could get up to
about 20 miles an hour

403
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,535
and chase these bowling balls
down the lane.

404
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,310
Well, you know, another convention
of the private eye movies...

405
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,849
I mean,
Raymond Chandler's stories,

406
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,416
but, again,
private eye movies generally,

407
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,047
is at some point
the private eye gets slugged,

408
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,114
or gets slipped
the Mickey Finn or whatever,

409
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,753
and goes into some sort of
delirium or hallucination.

410
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,057
That's sort of...

411
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,493
That's certainly
a hallmark in the movies

412
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,524
and in many of the novels that
movies are based on as well.

413
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,571
So in that respect,

414
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,801
we had license to do it
by virtue of the genre,

415
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,434
but also, it seemed like
we had a special license

416
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,241
to do that sort of splashy thing

417
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,806
by virtue of the character
as being a heavy drug user.

418
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,011
So, you know,
it just lets you do things

419
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,888
that are sort of a departure
from the rest of the movie,

420
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,689
and do, in a sense,
come out of nowhere,

421
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,562
are stylistically not like
the rest of the movie.

422
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,827
