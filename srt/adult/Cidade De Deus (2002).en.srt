Go on, for fuck’s sake!

—You think so, Rocket?
—Gotta take the risk.

7

8

Get that chicken, bro!

00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,834

Do you think I can become

85
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,839
I don’t know.

86
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,924
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

87
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,662
I don’t want to sell fish.
It stinks.

88
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,531

—No.

89
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,225
So what do you want to be?

90
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:30,224
I don’t know.

91
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,048
—Not a hood or a policeman.
—Why not?

92
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,482
I’m scared of getting shot.

93
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,435
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

94
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:47,173
Pointing that gun at me?

95
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:50,650
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li’l Dice is with me.

96
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,648
Right, I’m a gangster too.

97
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,386
—That gas truck didn’t bring much.
—So what?

98
00:09:56,647 --> 00:10:00,298
—We rob gas trucks every day.
—One today, another tomorrow.

99
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,775
No, we need to rob
some rich guy’s house.

100
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:05,382
That’s the only
way to get outta here.

101
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:08,903
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

102
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,554
That’s it.

103
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,813
The little fart’s getting
too big for his britches!

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,157
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

105
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:29,415
You two junkies aren’t worth
half as much as that kid.

106
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:34,283
What you got in mind, Li’l Dice?

107
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,237
<i>To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.</i>

108
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:44,496
<i>And Li’l Dice had them.</i>

109
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,190
—Is that the motel?
—Yeah.

110
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,275
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

111
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,882
—I need this.
—Don’t touch my gun, kid.

112
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,229
Don’t ever do that again.

113
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:00,098
—Don’t point at me.
—Fuck you.

114
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:03,922
—Don’t point your finger at me!
—Stop acting like a baby!

115
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,834
Here’s yours.

116
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,485
—Awesome!
—Let’s go!

117
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:11,223
—Not so fast!
—What?

118
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,918
You stay here and keep watch.

119
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:19,394
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

120
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,610
—Why me? Let that dork do that.
—Look …

121
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:27,955
I gave you this great plan, for free …
While that guy’s absolutely useless!

122
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:29,911
—You just had the idea.
—Exactly!

123
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:32,605
You’re just a kid, remember?

124
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,952
You cover us, okay?

125
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:41,775
You’ll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

126
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,426
You stay there.

127
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:51,336
This is a hold-up, bitch.

128
00:11:54,422 --> 00:12:01,115
You should be studying or working.
You don’t even look like hoodlums.

129
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:05,243
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

130
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:08,416
Shut up!
What a pain in the arse!

131
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:11,023
Okay, Clipper?

132
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,544
Shall we go in?

133
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,279
I didn’t order anything.

134
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,538
It’s on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

135
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:29,016
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

136
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,841
—Don’t point that …
—Your wallet …

137
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:44,704
Hey, man …

138
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:47,138
What kind of whorehouse is this?

139
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,875
—You from the church?
—Yes, brother.

140
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,917
Give it to me!

141
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,437
Slut!

142
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,436
You’re old, fat and flabby!

143
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,739
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:12,345
What’s going on?

145
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,213
—The cops! Let’s beat it!
—Let’s go!

146
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:24,817
Take that car.
I’ll go get Li’l Dice.

147
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,729
Jesus, what a car!

148
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:39,463
—Something fucked up. Li’l Dice’s gone.
—The cops are shooting, let’s go!

149
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,885
Slow down! Hold on …

150
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,840
—You said you knew how to drive.
—I do, so cool it!

151
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,839
Turn! Watch out!

152
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,267
You fucking arsehole!

153
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,961
Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose.

154
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:37,829
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

155
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,609
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

156
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,999
Goose fucked up his ankle.

157
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,173
It fucking hurts.

158
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:52,345
Take him into the woods.
I’ll shoot to distract the cops.

159
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,909
—In God we trust.
—In God we trust.

160
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:02,080
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

161
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:06,165
<i>Shorty is another notorious guy

162
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,381
<i>But it’s not yet time

163
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:14,335
—It fucking hurts, Goose.
—Shut up.

164
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,724
—Wait up …
—You sound like a damn sissy, man.

165
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,938
<i>—Give me your hand! Climb up!
—No one saw anything?</i>

166
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,023
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

167
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,196
I suppose you didn’t see
anything either?

168
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:39,237
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

169
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:43,366
So what’s up, Shorty?

170
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,843
They’re hiding in the woods.

171
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,407
—Hello, Melon-head.
—How are you doing?

172
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:53,101
I have this feeling that
they’re out in the woods.

173
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:56,882
—The motherfuckers.
—They’re out in the woods.

174
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,880
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

175
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,616
I can’t see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

176
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,223
Fucking jungle.

177
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,568
—They stole a fortune at that motel.
—I know.

178
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:24,565
What if we took the money?

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,216
Are you crazy?
I’m not getting mixed up in that.

180
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,953
I want to exterminate these guys.

181
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:36,430
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

182
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:43,427
It won’t be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

183
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:15,022
—Did you hear those shots?
—If I catch one of them, I’ll kill him.

184
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,320
Maracana!

185
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,841
Open the door.

186
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:36,795
—What’s the matter?
—The cops are after me.

187
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,617
Shaggy!

188
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,658
—Shaggy!
—The cops are on my arse!

189
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:54,092
—Hide me!
—Quick, come in.

190
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:06,260
Shit … I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

191
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,519
I had a vision, Goose.

192
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,083
You been smoking something?

193
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:17,169
—You’ve had a job, right?
—Yeah.

194
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,472
What’s it like?
What do people say?

195
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,862
I worked with my father.

196
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:25,600
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

197
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:30,902
You know what, Goose?
I’m getting out, I don’t want to die.

198
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:36,421
—This gangsters’ life isn’t for me.
—Wait! The cops are still down there.

199
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,246
I don’t give a shit.

200
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,113
I’m going back to the church.

201
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,851
<i>He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High …</i>

202
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:50,372
<i>shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord …</i>

203
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,804
<i>He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.</i>

204
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:58,325
<i>Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day …</i>

205
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:02,497
<i>nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction …</i>

206
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,582
—Stop, motherfucker!
—Don’t move!

207
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:10,319
Stop, or I’ll shoot!

208
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:17,012
<i>… shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.</i>

209
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:21,967
<i>The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.</i>

210
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,052
<i>The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.</i>

211
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,659
I don’t think this guy
was involved in the heist.

212
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,615
See here?

213
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:36,221
—He’s a worker, not a hoodlum.
—I’ll make him one now.

214
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:43,783
<i>Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.</i>

215
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:49,433
<i>Shaggy was in Bernice’s hands.</i>

216
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:54,648
<i>And Goose was
in my father’s hands.</i>

217
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:58,342
Why do you do these things?
You think I’m a fool?

218
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,210
From now on,
you’ll work with me.

219
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:05,643
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

220
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,816
You listen to me.

221
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:12,379
If I catch you with money that
isn’t yours, I’ll kill you.

222
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:18,464
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

223
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:24,374
<i>Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.</i>

224
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:28,894
Don’t worry.
Dad’s mad at me …

225
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:33,414
but he’ll get over it.

226
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:40,802
Give me that, Rocket. It’s not
for you. You have to study.

227
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:44,279
—Getting shot doesn’t scare you?
—I’m a hood because I got no brain.

228
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:48,320
But you’re smart.
You should study.

229
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:52,188
I go to school because
I don’t like physical work.

230
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,316
Promise me something …. That you’ll
never touch this gun. Promise?

231
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:00,054
Let’s shake.

232
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,183
We’d better hurry.

233
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:08,920
I’m gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don’t laugh.

234
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:10,832
You grinned when I got slapped.

235
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,962
—Who, me?
—I saw you.

236
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:44,296
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

237
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,208
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

238
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:51,597
—I’m thinking of what to say to you.
—You’re thinking, as well?

239
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:54,205
Don’t. It’ll be your downfall.

240
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:58,551
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

241
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:01,202
Are you pulling my leg?

242
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:04,635
You never heard of
love at first sight?

243
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,241
—Hoods don’t love, they desire.
—You cut down everything I say.

244
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:14,109
Hoods don’t talk,
they smooth-talk.

245
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:17,760
Well, I’ll stop wasting
my breath on you.

246
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,323
Hoods don’t stop,
they take a break.

247
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:24,974
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

248
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:28,668
It’s not love,
it’s a con game.

249
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:47,269
It’s just that I love you.

250
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:51,962
You just might end up
convincing me …

251
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,950
<i>After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.</i>

252
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:30,511
<i>Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.</i>

253
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:36,378
<i>But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.</i>

254
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:43,157
<i>No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.</i>

255
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,503
<i>Three Months Later</i>

256
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:48,807
Shaggy …

257
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:52,414
Why don’t you change your life?

258
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,673
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

259
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,672
—Good-for-nothing!
—What do you mean?

260
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,757
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

261
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:07,886
That’s right, Shaggy …
what do you think I do all day?

262
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:16,925
Take it easy, baby … you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids …

263
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,749
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

264
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,834
Sure! For me, that’s
nothing but smooth-talk.

265
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,915
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

266
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,132
Are you kidding?

267
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:45,956
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

268
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,215
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

269
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,953
Did you see anything?
You don’t know shit, so shut up.

270
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,212
You weren’t there.
I didn’t kill anyone.

271
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,123
I bet it’s those fucking policemen,
and I’m the one taking the rap.

272
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:04,904
They even nabbed Li’l Dice.
So don’t bring it up again!

273
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:09,294
—I don’t care who did it.
—It wasn’t me.

274
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:13,727
Let me just say … I don’t want my
kid’s father to be a hoodlum.

275
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,204
You’re all alone, Shaggy.

276
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,464
—All alone?
—That’s right!

277
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:19,420
—Clipper’s gone religious.
—Hallelujah!

278
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:21,332
—Goose is working.
—Arse-kisser!

279
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:23,679
—And you?
—I haven’t changed. So what?

280
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:28,199
They’ve deserted me,
that’s all.

281
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,632
Then I’m deserting you too.

282
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:33,153
I’m splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

283
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:37,369
Otherwise, I’ll go alone.

284
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:54,057
Fish for sale!

285
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:57,186
<i>My brother had promised
to stop messing around.</i>

286
00:25:57,403 --> 00:26:03,922
<i>But a hood doesn’t stop,
a hood takes a break.</i>

287
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:07,399
<i>Goose began messing around
with Shorty’s wife.</i>

288
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,266
I have trout. But for special
customers like you …

289
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:15,439
I also have a kisser fish.

290
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,003
Hey, that’s a mullet!

291
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,566
Doesn’t your husband …

292
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:24,913
go down on you?

293
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,651
No.

294
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:31,171
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

295
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:36,039
For about half-an-hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

296
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:41,471
—Good God, no. Doesn’t it hurt?
—The first few times.

297
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:45,382
Then you’ll see, it’s fantastic.
But you need a banana.

298
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:47,121
What for?

299
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:50,337
You’re missing the good things
in life, girl!

300
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:53,466
You take a banana, warm it up …

301
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,377
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

302
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:01,767
It’s a real rush!
Ask your husband.

303
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:06,721
I couldn’t. You don’t know him.
He’s liable to beat me.

304
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:10,632
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

305
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:20,498
Mother-fucking nigger!

306
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,148
Slut!

307
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,668
Whoring bitch!

308
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:35,708
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

309
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:40,141
—Take them off, dammit!
—I’m not going naked in the street.

310
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,183
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

311
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,269
Give me your shirt.

312
00:27:49,224 --> 00:27:51,136
Your shorts! Hurry up!

313
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:58,003
I knew it. It’s always me
who forks up for that bum.

314
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,955
The bastard ran off.
That’s his brother.

315
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,475
—That brat there?
—I’ll castrate that fucker.

316
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:18,733
Fish! Fish for sale!

317
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,427
Hey, kid, come over here.

318
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:26,425
—Where’s your brother?
—He’s not working today.

319
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,381
—Oh yeah? Get in.
—I didn’t do anything.

320
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,597
—Get in!
—What about my fish?

321
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:34,987
—Hurry it up, kid!
—I don’t want to lose my fish!

322
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:39,029
—Forget your fish.
—Sit your arse down.

323
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:43,070
—My father will kill me.
—That doesn’t matter.

324
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,673
Let’s go.
There’s nothing here.

325
00:28:56,847 --> 00:29:00,802
<i>That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.</i>

326
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,671
Let’s go, Felipe.

327
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,103
<i>And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.</i>

328
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,840
<i>The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.</i>

329
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,924
Li’l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

330
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:26,747
—You’re fucking loaded!
—Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

331
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,136
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

332
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:36,265
Benny … Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

333
00:29:36,612 --> 00:29:41,176
<i>—I’m leaving the ghetto.
—But Shorty had his hands full …</i>

334
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:57,342
Let’s go see, Stringy.

335
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,380
<i>A neighbour called the police
before sunrise.</i>

336
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,335
<i>The tabloids went to town:</i>

337
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:16,682
<i>“Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God”</i>

338
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,811
<i>Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.</i>

339
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:23,853
<i>The hoodlums took off.</i>

340
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:28,329
—You wanna die?
—It’s you who’s gonna die …

341
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:32,718
if you don’t do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

342
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,847
Let’s go, dammit!

343
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,759
—There are cops ahead.
—Fuck them, let’s go.

344
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,627
—Where to?
—Anywhere, just go.

345
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,190
—What’s the matter?
—Have mercy!

346
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:51,276
—This car’s a piece of junk.
—My arse! Start the damn thing!

347
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,100
It needs a push.

348
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,273
Push, Shaggy!

349
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:58,968
Push!

350
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:16,612
You?

351
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,089
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there …

352
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:23,566
Nab that guy over there!

353
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:49,946
Run, Shaggy!

354
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,596
Stop the car!

355
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:41,402
—This way! He’s over here.
—We got that son of a bitch!

356
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:59,263
—The bastard!
—He’s a murderer.

357
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:03,392
<i>On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds …</i>

358
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,347
<i>and a camera.</i>

359
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:09,737
<i>I’d always wanted to have one.</i>

360
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:14,387
Let’s go to school.

361
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,469
—Well?
—Let’s go to the beach.

362
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:26,904
But we have an exam.

363
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:30,728
So what?

364
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:33,596
Everyone else is at the beach.

365
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:36,769
Come on, let’s go!

366
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:40,419
She’s in a bikini,
but doesn’t want to go.

367
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:45,504
What’s that saying you have?

368
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:48,894
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

369
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,761
<i>The Seventies</i>

370
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,847
<i>—Over here!
—I bought my first camera …</i>

371
00:33:56,065 --> 00:34:00,324
<i>when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom …</i>

372
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,279
<i>with the world’s cheapest model.</i>

373
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:07,190
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

374
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,407
Any luck getting laid yet?

375
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:11,710
Zilch.

376
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:18,316
<i>—Angélica. I was crazy about her.
—So, Rocket, still clicking away?</i>

377
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,705
<i>She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.</i>

378
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:24,878
<i>I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.</i>

379
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,703
With her, buddy?
She’s got a guy.

380
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:32,136
—So? I’m not jealous.
—Her father’s a sergeant.

381
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,178
No one’s perfect.
Closer together!

382
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:38,655
<i>I was the official
photographer of our gang.</i>

383
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:45,695
<i>The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.</i>

384
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:55,256
Thiago, move back a little.

385
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:58,299
—Is this okay?
—Perfect.

386
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,207
I need a joint.

387
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:13,162
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It’s far out.

388
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:17,290
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

389
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,679
If you like,
I can get it for you.

390
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:27,460
You can? Then go on,
move your arse!

391
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:31,415
But the choice stuff is coke.
That’s a real necrotic.

392
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,979
Narcotic!

393
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:40,498
—Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
—Screw you.

394
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:43,322
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

395
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,017
—You’re never in the water.
—My dad’s a lifeguard.

396
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:50,146
—I’ll bet you a beer I swim better.
—You’re on.

397
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:56,751
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky’s.

398
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,918
<i>I’d have done anything
to please her …</i>

399
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,569
<i>Buy her pot, coke …</i>

400
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:26,043
<i>I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price …</i>

401
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:33,605
<i>because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.</i>

402
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,777
—Who is it?
—Rocket.

403
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,252
—How are things down there?
—Fine.

404
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,599
—And the kids?
—Fine too.

405
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:48,685
—You want to buy or smoke a joint?
—Buy.

406
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:53,596
Come in, buddy.

407
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:59,724
Who is it?

408
00:37:04,244 --> 00:37:06,634
<i>This was Blacky’s turf.</i>

409
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:10,458
<i>But it hadn’t always been his.</i>

410
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,543
—Hey, Blacky.
—Fuck, Li’l Dice.

411
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:20,020
—You show up like this at my place?
—Who said it was your place?

412
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:27,016
<i>The Story of The Apartment
Doña Zelia began selling drugs here …</i>

413
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:31,232
<i>when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.</i>

414
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:36,838
<i>She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favours.</i>

415
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:42,662
<i>Her favourite was “Big Boy”.
One day, he grew very big!</i>

416
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:47,964
<i>Zelia’s operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.</i>

417
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:53,353
<i>Big Boy used the neighbourhood
kids as dealers.</i>

418
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:58,264
—What about my pot?
—Stick it up your arse.

419
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:01,262
<i>The best dealer …</i>

420
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,695
<i>… was Carrot.</i>

421
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:08,477
—Can I have a sip?
—Sure.

422
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:11,345
<i>He earned Big Boy’s trust …</i>

423
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,518
<i>was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.</i>

424
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:18,429
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

425
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:22,818
<i>One day a buddy of Carrot’s
showed up.</i>

426
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:28,990
<i>—His name was Aristotle.
—My wife needs an operation.</i>

427
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:35,595
<i>His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.</i>

428
00:38:35,726 --> 00:38:38,507
<i>He couldn’t refuse to help
a brother in need.</i>

429
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:43,201
Here’s the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

430
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:46,199
—You’ve bailed me out, brother.
—Friday.

431
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:50,632
He’s my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

432
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:54,717
Give him another week.

433
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:01,541
<i>—Either you kill him, or I’ll kill you.
—Carrot had no choice.</i>

434
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:07,755
—I said Friday.
—Don’t do it, man.

435
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,536
<i>Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn’t necessary.</i>

436
00:39:12,014 --> 00:39:15,969
<i>Big Boy hadn’t paid off the cops.
He died in jail.</i>

437
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:22,749
<i>Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy …</i>

438
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:26,617
<i>but didn’t want the apartment …</i>

439
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:30,658
<i>the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer …</i>

440
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:33,614
<i>—Here. 15O bags.
—Blacky.</i>

441
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:35,874
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

442
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:39,524
<i>That’s how he took over
the local trade.</i>

443
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:41,871
<i>But not for long …</i>

444
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,304
Who is it?

445
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:47,347
Go see.

446
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:00,428
—Hey, Blacky.
—Fuck, Li’l Dice.

447
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:04,470

—Who said it was your place?

448
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:07,425

449
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,552
—Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
—Li’l Dice, my arse.

454
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:34,500
They’re having fun,

455
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,538
I want to get out of here.

456
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,536
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

457
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,923
<i>That night, Li’l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill …</i>

<i>though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.</i>

459
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:15,395
<i>To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.</i>

460
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:19,220
<i>He had to work hard for peanuts.</i>

—You have more money than me.
—It was my idea.

<i>… like my brother, Goose.
—Li’l Dice?</i>

Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

467
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:47,512
You’re fucking loaded!

468
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:51,380
Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

469
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:56,291

00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:08,190
Especially in selling coke.

499
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:10,667
—But you need money.
—Not really …

500
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:14,578
We’ll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

501
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,621
—When do we start?
—Now.

502
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:31,006
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

503
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,918
He brought you here.

504
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:39,307
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

505
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:44,522
I know what you want.
You want power.

506
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:48,824
I have something which will
give it to you.

507
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:54,909
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

508
00:44:55,169 --> 00:44:58,733
But you mustn’t fornicate
with the amulet …

509
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:01,297
otherwise …

510
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,861
you’ll die.

511
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:07,773
The boy is no longer called
Li’l Dice …

512
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:09,946
but Li’l Zé.

513
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:13,727
Li’l Zé will grow up.

514
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:17,768
You stick with me,
I’ll stick with you.

515
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:32,458
<i>Li’l Dice became Li’l Zé
and he began to kill.</i>

516
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:40,324
<i>He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani’s racket.</i>

517
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:45,887
<i>By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.</i>

518
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,537
<i>The only business he didn’t
touch was Carrot’s …</i>

519
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:53,666
<i>since he was a friend of Benny’s.
All that was left was the apartment …</i>

520
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,970
<i>But that would be easy.</i>

521
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,792
Who is it?

522
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:11,397
—Hey, Blacky.
—Fuck, Li’l Dice.

523
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:17,742
—You show up like this at my place?
—Who said it was your place?

524
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,524
—Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
—Li’l Dice, my arse.

525
00:46:19,785 --> 00:46:23,218
—My name is Li’l Zé now.
—His name’s Li’l Zé, see?

526
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:26,521
—You’re a goner, bastard.
—Don’t kill him. He understands.

527
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:28,911
Right, Blacky?

528
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:33,605
It’s all yours, I don’t want anything.
I don’t want no trouble, okay?

529
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:36,995
<i>I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother’s death.</i>

530
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,427
You’ll live, but you’ll
work for us. Understand?

531
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,687
<i>That’s easy to say …</i>

532
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:50,380
—Where are you going?
—He’s clean, Li’l Zé.

533
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,292
What’s your name, kid?

534
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,291
—Rocket.
—He’s Goose’s brother.

535
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:59,116
—Goose?
—The late Goose.

536
00:47:00,332 --> 00:47:02,549
Quick, kid. Run along.

537
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:07,329
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li’l Zé.

538
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:11,415
And that we’ll be selling coke.
Got that?

539
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,457
Cocaine.

540
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:19,411
—Where’s the turf?
—Over there, on the left.

541
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:22,627
<i>Selling drugs is like any
other business.</i>

542
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:24,930
<i>The supplier
delivers the merchandise …</i>

543
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,842
<i>which is then
packaged on the premises.</i>

544
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,927
<i>It’s done in an assembly line.</i>

545
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:34,187
<i>Boring as hell …</i>

546
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:38,664
<i>Pot is wrapped up in “lids”.</i>

547
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:41,662
<i>Cocaine is put into packets …</i>

548
00:47:42,314 --> 00:47:46,573
<i>and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.</i>

549
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:49,833
<i>You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.</i>

550
00:47:50,006 --> 00:47:53,874
<i>The kids start out
as delivery boys.</i>

551
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:58,177
<i>They’re paid to run errands
and take messages.</i>

552
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:02,045
<i>Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive …</i>

553
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:05,043
<i>the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.</i>

554
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,867
<i>Later, you become a dealer
or a “vapour”.</i>

555
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:13,127
<i>When the heat’s on, the
“vapour” quickly evaporates.</i>

556
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:17,429
<i>Moving up the ladder
you have the “soldier”.</i>

557
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:21,341
<i>And if the guy is good at maths,
he can become a manager …</i>

558
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:25,078
<i>the boss’ right-hand man.</i>

559
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:30,337
<i>The police receive their cut
and don’t make trouble.</i>

560
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:35,248
<i>Since Li’l Zé killed off
all of his enemies …</i>

561
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:40,332
<i>there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there …</i>

562
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,244
<i>The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.</i>

563
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:50,328
<i>The City teemed with addicts
and Li’l Zé grew rich.</i>

564
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:53,588
—Is it okay?
—It’s a deal.

565
00:48:57,238 --> 00:49:01,323
—I can’t decide which to wear.
—This one’s cool.

566
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:06,408
<i>If dealing were legal, Li’l Zé
would have been man of the year.</i>

567
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:12,797
<i>But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.</i>

568
00:49:13,014 --> 00:49:17,186
<i>—And he was everywhere.
—What a drag this guy is.</i>

569
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:22,488
<i>Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.</i>

570
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:30,050
Half a lid. Thanks.

571
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,309
<i>But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angélica.</i>

572
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:39,872
<i>She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.</i>

573
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:45,869
<i>—I was about to win her over …
—These pictures are really great.</i>

574
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:49,650
—You think so?
—I look good here.

575
00:49:49,824 --> 00:49:52,605
—You look beautiful everywhere.
—I’m serious.

576
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:53,866
Me too.

577
00:49:56,691 --> 00:50:01,949
<i>A setting sun,
a deserted beach … a long kiss …</i>

578
00:50:02,123 --> 00:50:05,165
<i>I was sure this was it …</i>

579
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,033
<i>But the Runts arrived.</i>

580
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:11,988
Can I have a toke?

581
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:18,811
Here.

582
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:23,244
I’m going. See you later.

583
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,329
Hold on, Angélica.

584
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:31,067
—Your joint, man.
—Keep it.

585
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:33,588
What a cool guy.

586
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:40,976
<i>That was my first run
in with the Runts.</i>

587
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,841
—Steak and fries, Benny.
—Great! Here …

588
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:59,272
—A tip for you.
—Really? Thanks.

589
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:01,793
—Wanna eat something?
—No.

590
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:09,181
<i>—Wanna trade this watch?
—After Angélica left him …</i>

591
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,310
<i>Thiago began snorting
more and more.</i>

592
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:14,657
—Is it your grandfather’s?
—No, my dad’s.

593
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:19,133
<i>When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.</i>

594
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,436
—Two bags of ten.
—One of ten.

595
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,739
<i>—Okay, one bag.
—For Thiago, it was different.</i>

596
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:29,520
—Watch out!
—Sorry, godfather.

597
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:32,605
Godfather, my arse.
Did I baptise your kids?

598
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,821
—I’m sorry.
—Now beat it.

599
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:42,427
Blacky, lend me your bike.

600
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:08,242
Hey, wanna race?

601
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,893
—Where to?
—Up to the highway.

602
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,456
—Okay.
—Ready? Go!

603
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,662
—Pretty tough, wasn’t it?
—Yeah, you’re good.

604
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:44,226
Where’d you buy those sneakers?

605
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,008
—Not far from here.
—The shirt, as well?

606
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:49,572
—No, uptown.
—Cool.

607
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:52,006
It’s a designer shirt.

608
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:54,483
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

609
00:52:54,787 --> 00:52:57,395
Shorts and a shirt?

610
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,914
Buy whatever you can.

611
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:06,738
—What size are you?
—Measure me.

612
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:09,824
—With what, man?
—Shit, with your hand.

613
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,996
Shoe size? Turn around.

614
00:53:22,818 --> 00:53:27,729
—Hey, Benny!
—You got the digs?

615
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:34,118
—Just one pair of pants?
—No, there’s more.

616
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,376
—You like it?
—Yeah.

617
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,983
There’s some change.

618
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:47,547
—Keep it.
—Cool.

619
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:58,716
This is Benny.

620
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:03,322
—This is Rocket.
—Hi. I know him.

621
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,441
I’ve become a playboy.

622
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,569
Hey, gangsters, listen to this …

623
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:38,611
Watch out …

624
00:54:38,785 --> 00:54:42,392
Groovies shake their arses
before laying a big one.

625
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,694
Oh, yeah?

626
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,171
Fuck off, you bastards!

627
00:54:53,518 --> 00:54:57,473
Making fun of me?

628
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:00,819
Arsehole!

629
00:55:15,682 --> 00:55:19,898
Benny, didn’t I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He’s endangering the ghetto.

630
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,679
—Cool it. Go talk to him.
—I’m gonna kill that fucker.

631
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,764
—Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
—I’m gonna kill him.

632
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:32,023
Don’t worry, Angélica.
The guys in here are cool.

633
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:34,978
Sure, I’m not worried.

634
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:39,237
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

635
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:43,496
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

636
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:47,277
<i>Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.</i>

637
00:55:47,495 --> 00:55:50,667
<i>He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.</i>

638
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:54,231
<i>Li’l Zé was the opposite.
He had one obsession:</i>

639
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:56,404
<i>To be the boss of the ghetto.</i>

640
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:59,880
<i>He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot’s racket.</i>

641
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:01,749
—Hey, Carrot.
—What’s up?

642
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:06,182
You shouldn’t let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

643
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,615
You look after your section,
I’ll look after mine.

644
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:13,614
Got that? I’m gonna get a drink.

645
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:26,478
—Hey, Rocket! How’s it going?
—Great.

646
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:29,694
—Hey, Benny!
—How’s it going?

647
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:33,388
—Hey, Thiago. How are you?
—Good.

648
00:56:34,387 --> 00:56:35,952
—May I?
—Sure …

649
00:56:36,169 --> 00:56:38,429
Wanna dance?

650
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:45,426
—Is it okay at your place?
—No problem.

651
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:49,294
My parents are out.
You’ll be all alone with her.

652
00:56:49,555 --> 00:56:53,900
—You can lose your virginity tonight.
—Not so loud, man!

653
00:56:54,074 --> 00:56:55,769
Everyone will hear.

654
00:56:57,116 --> 00:56:59,376
—You’re beautiful.
—Thank you.

655
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:04,113
—Shit!
—Nothing’s happening.

656
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:15,674
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

657
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:19,498
Think I’m a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

658
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:23,887
I want to talk to you
because you’re fucking useless.

659
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:25,104
Get your hand away!

660
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:28,320
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

661
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:29,885
Give the baby his bottle.

662
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:32,492
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

663
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:36,099
Carrot’s useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

664
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:39,272
The police come around and
that’s bad for business.

665
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:43,140
I’ll do it only because
I like you.

666
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:45,139
But you need to change
that baby’s diapers.

667
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:49,137
I’ll show you who’s the baby …

668
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:54,830
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

669
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,525
No wonder you’re “Little” Zé!

670
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:04,739
<i>The Runts were kids who didn’t
respect the laws of the ghetto.</i>

671
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,259
<i>They would mug residents,
hold-up bakeries …</i>

672
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,650
<i>especially in Carrot’s section.</i>

673
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:17,256
What are you doing?

674
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:23,514
<i>—You rob me all the time!
—But they didn’t know …</i>

675
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:26,034
<i>that the City had a boss now.</i>

676
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,902
<i>Thank You for Choosing Us</i>

677
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:33,857
<i>The City had become
much safer for residents.</i>

678
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:38,203
<i>There were hardly
any hold-ups now.</i>

679
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:39,724
<i>You just had to go see Li’l Zé.</i>

680
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:43,070
—Let’s go.
—Don’t hurt the Runts.

681
00:58:43,157 --> 00:58:46,069
I won’t touch them.

682
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,762
—Hi, Steak.
—How’s it going, Li’l Zé?

683
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,587
—Wanna take a walk, Steak?
—With you? Hold on …

684
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,020
Mum, I’m going out with
my friends.

685
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:15,230
That’s the best chicken
I ever ate.

686
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:19,620
—The old guy was scared shitless.
—Feeling sorry for him?

687
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,966
You’re crazy, man!

688
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:34,222
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

689
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:38,916
—Peanuts. Drugs are where it’s at.
—Yeah, selling drugs.

690
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:45,435
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

691
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:50,997
It’s a rip-off.
It takes a long time to move up.

692
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:55,517
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

693
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:58,907
I don’t wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I’m gonna do what Li’l Zé did.

694
00:59:59,124 --> 01:00:01,775
I’m gonna wipe them all out.

695
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:04,904
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

696
01:00:08,903 --> 01:00:10,554
Come back, you brat!

697
01:00:14,857 --> 01:00:21,549
—They’re quick, those kids.
—They run fast.

698
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:25,721
They’re all gone except you.
Any others?

699
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,891
You’re gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

700
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:40,280
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

701
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,844
Come on, choose!

702
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,800
Hand or foot?

703
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:51,058
Choose, for fuck’s sake!

704
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,966
—Hand.
—The little hand, eh?

705
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:12,875
Cool.

706
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:18,568
Hey, Steak’n’fries,
let’s see what you’re made of.

707
01:01:18,872 --> 01:01:22,045
Choose and then kill
one of them.

708
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:26,043
—Leave it. I’ll do it.
—Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

709
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,822
Go on, Steak.

710
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:37,473
Go on, choose one and shoot.

711
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:40,732
Come on, I haven’t got all day.

712
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,861
Kill one of them.

713
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:50,076
Let’s go, Steak.
I’m in a hurry.

714
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:53,770
I wanna see what you’re made of.

715
01:01:58,942 --> 01:02:02,288
Well done!

716
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,679
You did it.

717
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:09,676
—You’re one of us. Give me five.
—Very good, Steak.

718
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:19,150
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

719
01:02:19,976 --> 01:02:24,192
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li’l Zé’s ghetto.

720
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:27,190
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

721
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,797
Cool, Li’l Zé.

722
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:47,920
<i>While Li’l Zé was winning
the respect of the residents …</i>

723
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:51,354
<i>Benny was winning
Angélica’s heart.</i>

724
01:02:51,919 --> 01:02:56,612
<i>As for me, I was still
a virgin, single, and broke.</i>

725
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,089
<i>I had no choice.</i>

726
01:03:00,089 --> 01:03:03,088
<i>Sucker’s Life</i<

727
01:03:03,262 --> 01:03:07,043
<i>I had to take a job
in a supermarket.</i>

728
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,823
<i>I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off …</i>

729
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:16,082
<i>so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.</i>

730
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:20,341
<i>But things didn’t
work out that way.</i>

731
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,121
—It’s the guy on the beach.
—Hey, bro!

732
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:29,033
—Still smoking good stuff?
—Yeah.

733
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,858
That guy’s too cool.

734
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:33,683
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

735
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,940
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don’t appreciate it.

736
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:45,634
—What about my severance pay?
—What severance pay?

737
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:49,763
<i>That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.</i>

738
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:55,152
You’re fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

739
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:58,890
<i>I didn’t get a single cent.</i>

740
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,796
<i>It was like a message from God:</i>

741
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:21,010
<i>“Honesty doesn’t pay, sucker.”</i>

742
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,444
<i>Flirting With Crime</i>

743
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:37,351
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

744
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:41,567
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

745
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:43,392
It was Goose’s.
It’s broken anyway.

746
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,651
It’s not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

747
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:51,519
It’s never anyone’s fault.
It’s always someone else’s.

748
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:55,604
But it’s the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

749
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:57,951
Have a nice evening, ma’am.

750
01:05:00,515 --> 01:05:02,818
I know that guy.

751
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,122
He lives in the City.
He’ll recognize us.

752
01:05:05,382 --> 01:05:07,903
So? He couldn’t care less
if we take his boss’ money.

753
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,380
Okay. Let’s go.

754
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:16,856
Well, boys? Aren’t you from
the City of God?

755
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,551
Yeah.

756
01:05:18,724 --> 01:05:21,897
I’ll let one of you through
without paying.

757
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:30,372
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

758
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:33,283
It’s too full of cops and
hoodlums.

759
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:37,586
—Did you study?
—I was in school and in the army.

760
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,845
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

761
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,540
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

762
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,059
But I do karate.
If I’m hired somewhere …

763
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,363
I’ll leave the ghetto.

764
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:55,274
—Do you fight, then?
—I’m for peace and love.

765
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:57,099
But if I have to …

766
01:05:57,316 --> 01:06:00,141
<i>He didn’t know he would have to.</i>

767
01:06:00,402 --> 01:06:03,922
<i>But not yet, it’s not time
to tell Knockout Ned’s story.</i>

768
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,660
—We should be going.
—Let’s go.

769
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:07,790
—Good bye.
—Thanks.

770
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:09,572
See you.

771
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:17,568
I couldn’t do it.
He was such a cool guy.

772
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:20,958
Yeah, totally.
That’s Gerson’s brother.

773
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:24,218
Let’s go home.

774
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:30,259
There’s nothing here
except that bakery over there.

775
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:35,430
—What will you say?
—I don’t know. “This is a hold-up.”

776
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:39,124
Here’s my number.

777
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,471
—You like soul or groovy parties?
—Soul.

778
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:43,601
<i>That one didn’t work either.</i>

779
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:47,251
<i>The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.</i>

780
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,511
Will you call me?

781
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:53,249
I couldn’t pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

782
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:55,248
Yeah, I agree.

783
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:05,374
Excuse me. I’m lost.
How do I get to Barra?

784
01:07:05,504 --> 01:07:06,547
—To Barra?
—Yes.

785
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:09,589
<i>I thought: “Tough luck
for this guy from São Paulo.”</i>

786
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:12,718
—In fact, we were going there.
—You’re kidding.

787
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:17,412
—You’re a lifesaver.
—That’s right.

788
01:07:18,064 --> 01:07:21,584
<i>Because no guy from São Paulo
could ever be cool.</i>

789
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,232
—The body’s over here.
—We found it, Chief.

790
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,926
The forensic expert!

791
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:52,397
—Not a pretty sight, eh?
—You said it.

792
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:54,961
—What a great singer.
—You like him?

793
01:07:55,178 --> 01:08:00,437
—I love music. What about you?
—Tell me, do you also like pot?

794
01:08:03,783 --> 01:08:06,304
I can’t say I’ve never tried it.

795
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:09,607
The devil recognizes his own.

796
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:14,344
—Do you have papers?
—I think so.

797
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:17,038
I have some.

798
01:08:19,515 --> 01:08:22,384
<i>I’d always been an ace
at rolling a joint.</i>

799
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:24,904
<i>If I’d had the same skill
with girls …</i>

800
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:29,946
<i>I’d never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.</i>

801
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:36,769
—For a São Paulo guy you’re very cool.
—Thanks, bro.

802
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:39,941
What did they use?

803
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:44,287
A club or a rock.
And the child?

804
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:47,416
—Untouched.
—Thank goodness.

805
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:52,414
—How long ago?
—About four hours.

806
01:08:52,936 --> 01:08:55,587
—Can we take it away?
—Go ahead.

807
01:08:57,021 --> 01:09:00,889
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

808
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:24,313
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

809
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:27,877
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

810
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:31,180
—The place is crawling with cops now!
—Come on, Li’l Zé.

811
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:35,743
—Come on? Fuck you!
—I had to avenge my honour.

812
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:39,481
Her family’s turned me in.
You won’t have any problems.

813
01:09:39,698 --> 01:09:43,262
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You’re dead meat, arsehole.

814
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:46,260
Let up, Li’l Zé.
You’ve punished him enough.

815
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:48,564
You know the law.

816
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:51,519
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

817
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:54,213
That was his business, Li’l Zé.

818
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:57,082
Listen, you son of a bitch,
get outta the ghetto.

819
01:09:57,212 --> 01:09:59,342
You showed no respect, understand?

820
01:10:02,862 --> 01:10:04,209
You know what, Benny?

821
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:07,947
You’re too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

822
01:10:08,164 --> 01:10:10,989
He wasn’t worth shit.

823
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,292
—A dirty traitor.
—Shut up, Tuba.

824
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:16,856
I’m going for a walk
with my girl.

825
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:22,158
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down …

826
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:25,461
we’ll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

827
01:10:30,415 --> 01:10:33,327
You need a girlfriend, Li’l Zé.

828
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,056
Know what I’m thinking, Benny?

829
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,098
That I’m so sexy?

830
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:02,879
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

831
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:06,617
—Make love again.
—I’m serious.

832
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:11,832
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

833
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,439
Go where?

834
01:11:15,265 --> 01:11:17,221
To a farm.

835
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:22,697
We’re really hippies at heart,
aren’t we?

836
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:26,304
A farm?

837
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,214
Peace and love?

838
01:11:52,162 --> 01:11:56,856
<i>Benny’s Farewell</i>

839
01:12:05,504 --> 01:12:08,850
<i>Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.</i>

840
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:12,631
<i>He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.</i>

841
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:14,022
<i>The gangs …</i>

842
01:12:15,804 --> 01:12:17,847
<i>The soul crowd …</i>

843
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:27,755
<i>—The religious crowd …
—One day, I’ll go to church.</i>

844
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:29,928
<i>The samba crowd …</i>

845
01:12:33,622 --> 01:12:35,752
<i>The groovy crowd …</i>

846
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:42,531
<i>And Li’l Zé, who had never
danced in his life.</i>

847
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:06,478
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

848
01:13:06,695 --> 01:13:09,085
—I didn’t hear …
—Want to dance?

849
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:12,432
No, thank you, I’m with someone.

850
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,642
Hey, Rocket!

851
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:45,852
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

852
01:13:46,895 --> 01:13:49,893
—You can’t just split with that chick.
—Why not?

853
01:13:50,154 --> 01:13:54,326
I’m gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

854
01:13:54,544 --> 01:13:58,455
You wanna throw away everything
we’ve accomplished for that bitch?

855
01:13:59,063 --> 01:14:02,062
She’s not a bitch, she’s my girl.

856
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,800
We’ll take over Carrot’s business,
it’ll be yours.

857
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:08,538
—Leave Carrot alone, he’s a good guy.
—He’s a motherfucker!

858
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:11,971
See? Everyone’s a motherfucker
to you. That’s why I’m leaving.

859
01:14:12,232 --> 01:14:15,839
I’m your friend,
but I’m getting out.

860
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:18,359
You got to understand,
I have to go.

861
01:14:19,446 --> 01:14:23,922
I love you, man,
but I’ve had enough.

862
01:15:23,027 --> 01:15:25,461
Motherfucker, let’s see
if you have any balls.

863
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:29,242
—What is this?
—You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

864
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:32,892
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your arse.

865
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:37,586
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

866
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:41,410
I wanna see your arse.
Come on, faggot!

867
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:44,409
Let’s go, nigger!

868
01:15:54,361 --> 01:15:57,316
Show your arse to everyone!

869
01:15:57,838 --> 01:15:59,576
Please …

870
01:16:04,574 --> 01:16:07,095
—Strip, dammit!
—Hurry it up!

871
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:22,262
What’s up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

872
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:27,129
—I don’t deal anymore.
—C’mon, do it for me. You’re my friend.

873
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:29,911
—Is it stolen?
—It’s okay, it’s my dad’s.

874
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,649
Your dad’s?

875
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:38,994
—Give it to Li’l Zé.
—Rocket would love this camera.

876
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,861
—Yeah, here.
—Great.

877
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,675
Here I am!

878
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,022
—You wanna be a photographer?
—Yeah.

879
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:19,281
—Here’s a present.
—Shit, dude! This is great!

880
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,279
Now move your arse.
Shake it!

881
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,312
You’ll take some great pictures.

882
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:50,180
Give me that.

883
01:17:55,395 --> 01:18:01,610
—Give me back the camera!
—No!

884
01:18:04,652 --> 01:18:11,215
What’s your problem?
Are you crazy?

885
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:41,940
They’ve killed Benny!

886
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:48,503
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where’s the motherfucker who did it?

887
01:18:49,285 --> 01:18:54,413
—Zé, Benny is dead.
—No! Call a doctor!

888
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,583
Get out of here, bitch!
It’s your fault!

889
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:08,972
Motherfucker!

890
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:35,352
Where’s Carrot?

891
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:37,264
Blacky’s here.

892
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:42,262
He’s in trouble.

893
01:19:44,392 --> 01:19:46,043
I’m fucked.

894
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,433
—Why?
—I’m fucked.

895
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:51,519
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

896
01:19:51,693 --> 01:19:53,822
Li’l Zé is coming
to take your place.

897
01:19:54,126 --> 01:19:56,430
We can get him,
he’s in the dance hall.

898
01:19:56,647 --> 01:19:58,255
You killed Benny?

899
01:19:58,429 --> 01:20:01,906
I didn’t mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’l Zé.

900
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:04,339
Come on, let’s go.

901
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:07,121
Blacky …

902
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:09,859
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

903
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:12,336
Let’s go get Li’l Zé.

904
01:20:20,376 --> 01:20:24,983
<i>Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.</i>

905
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:28,285
We’re fucked, man.

906
01:20:37,977 --> 01:20:43,192
<i>But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?</i>

907
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,668
Look who’s here.
My sugar babe.

908
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:50,537
—Let me by.
—Gimme a kiss, girl.

909
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:54,752
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

910
01:20:56,795 --> 01:20:59,750
Come on, Li’l Zé.

911
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:10,789
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

912
01:21:18,568 --> 01:21:25,087
<i>The problem was simple. Li’l Zé was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.</i>

913
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:31,388
<i>Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li’l Zé had to pay or use force.</i>

914
01:21:32,084 --> 01:21:35,604
<i>It was a duel between
the handsome good guy …</i>

915
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:37,951
<i>and the ugly bad guy.</i>

916
01:21:38,212 --> 01:21:40,819
—Let me go!
—Just enjoy it.

917
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:53,553
There’s no use fighting.
You’re mine now.

918
01:21:57,768 --> 01:22:01,028
Hey, faggot, your broad’s
really hot!

919
01:22:33,275 --> 01:22:35,578
I can’t even look her in
the face now.

920
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:49,094
Why didn’t that fucker kill me?

921
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:57,221
Hold on …
Why didn’t I kill that fucker?

922
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,654
Let’s go back.

923
01:22:59,828 --> 01:23:02,653
—What about Carrot?
—We’ll get back to him.

924
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,087
You gonna kill him?

925
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:11,823
Knockout Ned, your chick’s a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

926
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:17,473
—Come out, you loser!
—Take it easy …

927
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:21,906
I’m going out. Let me go.

928
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:37,290
Gerson! Come back, son!

929
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,675
This doesn’t concern you, kid.
We’re here for your brother.

930
01:23:51,849 --> 01:23:55,369
Let’s talk, we can work it out.
My brother’s a peaceful guy.

931
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,803
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

932
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,237
He hasn’t done anything.

933
01:24:00,845 --> 01:24:04,148
You know who I am?

934
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:07,408
—Li’l Zé, man.
—He’s Li’l Zé.

935
01:24:08,016 --> 01:24:10,884
Call that motherfucker!

936
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:18,359
Go on, man.

937
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:21,184
Calm down, I’ll call him.

938
01:24:54,735 --> 01:24:58,168
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

939
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,732
That loser got what he deserved.

940
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,862
Let’s go!

941
01:25:26,547 --> 01:25:30,545
Gerson …

942
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:34,370
That bastard killed my brother.

943
01:25:42,236 --> 01:25:45,017
I can’t let that go.

944
01:26:00,272 --> 01:26:02,401
—Want a gun?
—My son …

945
01:26:02,618 --> 01:26:06,008
Calm down, mum.

946
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:09,702
Please, mum …

947
01:26:18,568 --> 01:26:22,175
Do it right, arsehole.

948
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:26,173
—There’s no other way.
—How’d I let that loser hit me?

949
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:28,737
Shit, that’s some hole.

950
01:26:58,507 --> 01:27:01,506
—It’s as if we were brothers.
—Shut up.

951
01:27:01,767 --> 01:27:06,286
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

952
01:27:06,504 --> 01:27:10,285
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

953
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:16,673
That Knockout Ned’s not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

954
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:21,019
Shut up, Tuba!
You’re a fucking pain!

955
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:32,753
<i>It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.</i>

956
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:35,100
God bless you, son.

957
01:27:35,274 --> 01:27:38,490
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

958
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,488
Well done.

959
01:27:41,793 --> 01:27:44,965
You did a good job.

960
01:27:45,139 --> 01:27:48,746
You’d better go hide.

961
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:54,657
<i>I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.</i>

962
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,525
<i>But God had other plans.</i>

963
01:27:57,916 --> 01:28:01,393
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

964
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,913
They’re hiding.
Li’l Zé is in a bad mood.

965
01:28:05,174 --> 01:28:08,868
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

966
01:28:08,998 --> 01:28:12,258
Do me a favour. Go get some
nose candy for me.

967
01:28:12,475 --> 01:28:13,909
I’ll try.

968
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,647
Tell them it’s for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

969
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:43,461
Steak’n’fries,
go to Carrot’s and tell him …

970
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:49,024
Li’l Zé says that if you kill
Knockout, he’ll leave you alone.

971
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:52,544
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

972
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:55,456
Grab the kid!

973
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:03,322
You heard the boy? If you don’t
stick with us, you’re dead.

974
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,756
I think you should join us.
We’ll be partners.

975
01:29:07,451 --> 01:29:10,450
Drugs aren’t my thing.

976
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,753
This is just something
between me and him.

977
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:17,490
Those guys aren’t worth shit.

978
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:21,271
They’ll do anything for power.

979
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:23,835
Like that kid.

980
01:29:24,139 --> 01:29:28,268
They’re all robots,
like this punk here.

981
01:29:28,485 --> 01:29:30,702
What’s in your head, kid?

982
01:29:30,876 --> 01:29:33,266
Can’t you see you’re
wrecking your life …

983
01:29:33,527 --> 01:29:37,786
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

984
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:45,869
—Are you crazy? You’re just a kid.
—A kid? I smoke, snort …

985
01:29:46,043 --> 01:29:49,433
I’ve killed and robbed.
I’m a man.

986
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,127
Shit, you have no idea!

987
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,517
He’s attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

988
01:29:55,821 --> 01:30:00,689
—Shall we kill him?
—Steak, we’re going to grind you.

989
01:30:02,253 --> 01:30:06,512
—Okay, I accept.
—Great!

990
01:30:06,686 --> 01:30:10,771
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

991
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:17,203
But on one condition:
No killing of innocent people.

992
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:21,462
I can’t accept that, understand?

993
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:26,330
Okay, no innocent people.

994
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:32,631
Steak fucked up!

995
01:30:44,322 --> 01:30:47,016
—Have you a gun for me?
—No …

996
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:50,667
but we can hold-up
a gun store.

997
01:30:50,841 --> 01:30:52,927
That’s no problem.

998
01:30:53,057 --> 01:30:56,621
I don’t want to hold-up anything.
I’m not a hoodlum.

999
01:30:56,838 --> 01:31:00,011
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1000
01:31:00,619 --> 01:31:02,923
I’m not a hoodlum.

1001
01:31:05,356 --> 01:31:07,269
He raped your chick …

1002
01:31:07,486 --> 01:31:11,354
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house …

1003
01:31:11,528 --> 01:31:14,874
and you killed one of his guys.

1004
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:22,870
If you’re not a hood,
then get out.

1005
01:31:27,912 --> 01:31:32,388
<i>The Story of Knockout Ned</i>

1006
01:31:33,518 --> 01:31:36,039
This is a hold-up!

1007
01:31:44,252 --> 01:31:47,816
<i>—The first time …
—Where are the revolvers?</i>

1008
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:51,510
<i>… Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.</i>

1009
01:31:51,727 --> 01:31:56,073
We said no killing!

1010
01:31:56,334 --> 01:31:58,116
That’s the rule.

1011
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:04,635
We want the boss’ money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

1012
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:07,807
You want us to go?
We do too.

1013
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:10,372
So hurry up!

1014
01:32:11,588 --> 01:32:13,935
<i>—Look at the ground!
—The second time …</i>

1015
01:32:14,109 --> 01:32:16,152
<i>Carrot saved
Knockout Ned’s life.</i>

1016
01:32:18,976 --> 01:32:22,106
<i>Ned learned that there’s
an exception to every rule.</i>

1017
01:32:22,714 --> 01:32:24,930
Exception to the rule.

1018
01:32:25,235 --> 01:32:28,407
—Are you the manager?
—Yes.

1019
01:32:28,581 --> 01:32:32,492
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1020
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:34,796
On the ground!

1021
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:39,185
Give me the money!

1022
01:32:42,227 --> 01:32:44,400
I’m not kidding.

1023
01:32:44,618 --> 01:32:46,834
The first person who moves
is dead!

1024
01:32:47,182 --> 01:32:50,789
<i>The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.</i>

1025
01:33:06,651 --> 01:33:11,041
<i>Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li’l Zé.</i>

1026
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:14,083
<i>Carrot could protect his
business.</i>

1027
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,082
<i>Knockout Ned …</i>

1028
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:19,211
<i>the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.</i>

1029
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:23,687
First, the Italians.
This is a 9mm.

1030
01:33:24,383 --> 01:33:26,556
—Let me see.
—Not bad, eh?

1031
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:31,467
—The sight isn’t well-aligned.
—I’ll give you a good price.

1032
01:33:32,249 --> 01:33:34,248
The 12mm, the “hand job”.

1033
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,117
See why?

1034
01:33:36,334 --> 01:33:39,333
An Uzi, 9mm. It’s Israeli.

1035
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:42,462
—The star of David.
—Jewish.

1036
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:44,026
I want a 30-06.

1037
01:33:44,548 --> 01:33:46,851
Now we can start having fun.

1038
01:33:47,069 --> 01:33:51,415
The war’s on.
Let’s start with a prayer.

1039
01:33:51,762 --> 01:33:55,891
<i>Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name …</i>

1040
01:33:56,108 --> 01:34:00,237
<i>Ourwill be done …</i>

1041
01:34:00,758 --> 01:34:03,279
<i>On earth as it is in heaven …</i>

1042
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:18,577
<i>Hoodlums have guns,
but can’t shoot.</i>

1043
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:22,966
<i>One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li’l Zé’s gang.</i>

1044
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:27,312
<i>Li’l Zé couldn’t take it.
He counter-attacked.</i>

1045
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:34,222
<i>The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.</i>

1046
01:34:38,177 --> 01:34:43,870
<i>I decided to get out.
That’s how I became a reporter.</i>

1047
01:34:44,652 --> 01:34:47,043
Great photo!

1048
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,824
I bet it’s by Rogerio Reis.

1049
01:34:50,389 --> 01:34:53,127
What did I tell you?

1050
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:55,561
<i>Like any pro …</i>

1051
01:34:55,778 --> 01:34:59,211
<i>I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.</i>

1052
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:02,862
<i>Without knowing what awaited me.</i>

1053
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:07,468
<i>Instead of going home
I’d go over to the paper.</i>

1054
01:35:07,686 --> 01:35:10,989
<i>A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.</i>

1055
01:35:11,249 --> 01:35:14,205
Check this out.

1056
01:35:14,378 --> 01:35:18,377
<i>He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.</i>

1057
01:35:18,594 --> 01:35:20,202
—Hi, Rogerio.
—How are you, Pierre?

1058
01:35:20,376 --> 01:35:22,940
This is Rocket.
He’s a photographer.

1059
01:35:23,157 --> 01:35:24,418
Hello, Rocket.

1060
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:26,851
—He’s a fan of yours.
—Really?

1061
01:35:27,025 --> 01:35:28,720
You have good taste, Rocket!

1062
01:35:28,894 --> 01:35:31,980
—Well, I’m done. I’m off.
—See you.

1063
01:35:32,197 --> 01:35:34,935
What a cool guy!

1064
01:35:35,717 --> 01:35:38,803
<i>What should have been
a swift revenge …</i>

1065
01:35:39,063 --> 01:35:41,584
<i>turned into an all-out war.</i>

1066
01:35:46,669 --> 01:35:48,885
<i>The City of God was divided.</i>

1067
01:35:49,103 --> 01:35:52,883
<i>You couldn’t go from one
section to the other.</i>

1068
01:35:53,101 --> 01:35:55,361
<i>Not even to visit a relative.</i>

1069
01:35:55,534 --> 01:35:59,272
<i>The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.</i>

1070
01:35:59,402 --> 01:36:02,879
<i>People got used to living
in Vietnam.</i>

1071
01:36:07,008 --> 01:36:12,093
<i>And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.</i>

1072
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,222
This kid …

1073
01:36:13,396 --> 01:36:16,221
—What do you want?
—A boy from Carrot’s gang punched me.

1074
01:36:16,656 --> 01:36:18,133
<i>The war was
an excuse for everything.</i>

1075
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:20,437
One of Li’l Zé’s soldiers
kicked me.

1076
01:36:22,436 --> 01:36:24,522
Take this .22.

1077
01:36:26,304 --> 01:36:28,781
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1078
01:36:28,998 --> 01:36:30,345
Li’l Zé evicted my family.

1079
01:36:31,388 --> 01:36:32,996
Kill …. Be respected.

1080
01:36:45,469 --> 01:36:50,945
—I’m Thiago, a friend of Benny’s.
—Can you read? Can you add?

1081
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:56,595
—I’m pretty good in business.
—Okay, get to work.

1082
01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:00,419
—What do you want?
—To get my father’s murderer.

1083
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:03,592
—What’s your name?
—My name’s Otto.

1084
01:37:09,024 --> 01:37:10,936
What’s the matter?

1085
01:37:11,067 --> 01:37:15,109
—He’s a worker.
—But he wants a gun.

1086
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:18,585
He won’t last a week.

1087
01:37:29,537 --> 01:37:34,448
<i>A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.</i>

1088
01:37:34,622 --> 01:37:35,926
Take that!

1089
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:44,661
<i>For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy’s business in order …</i>

1090
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:48,398
<i>to buy more guns and take over
more business.</i>

1091
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:13,431
<i>I smoke, snort,
I’ve killed and robbed.</i>

1092
01:38:13,648 --> 01:38:15,952
<i>I’m a man.</i>

1093
01:38:37,638 --> 01:38:42,723
<i>The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.</i>

1094
01:38:56,586 --> 01:39:00,976
<i>A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.</i>

1095
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:02,888
<i>Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned …</i>

1096
01:39:03,149 --> 01:39:06,669
<i>was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li’l Zé’s gang.</i>

1097
01:39:06,843 --> 01:39:09,103
<i>Our reporter interviewed him.</i>

1098
01:39:09,233 --> 01:39:13,144
<i>—Is the war still going on?
—It’s still going on.</i>

1099
01:39:13,492 --> 01:39:18,055
<i>—Have many people died?
—Many have died.</i>

1100
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:20,402
<i>Mostly innocent people.</i>

1101
01:39:20,532 --> 01:39:23,922
<i>Just knowing me is enough …</i>

1102
01:39:24,183 --> 01:39:28,877
<i>to get you killed by Li’l Zé.</i>

1103
01:39:29,007 --> 01:39:32,397
<i>—The police don’t go in there?
—They go after me, not him.</i>

1104
01:39:32,571 --> 01:39:38,829
<i>I’ve been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.</i>

1105
01:39:39,089 --> 01:39:41,132
<i>And they don’t arrest him.</i>

1106
01:39:41,393 --> 01:39:43,696
<i>Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.</i>

1107
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:49,433
<i>Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.</i>

1108
01:39:57,994 --> 01:39:59,646
Motherfucker!

1109
01:39:59,863 --> 01:40:03,514
I’m the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1110
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:07,208
—Have you found mine?
—Just Knockout Ned’s.

1111
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:08,903
Keep looking.

1112
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:12,032
At least my name’s
got to be in there.

1113
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,900
—There’s nothing.
—Can you read?

1114
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:16,595
Just the pictures.

1115
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:19,724
Nothing.

1116
01:40:19,898 --> 01:40:22,983
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:40:23,114 --> 01:40:28,285
—It’s just the want ads.
—I don’t care, read everything!

1118
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:32,588
—But there aren’t any articles.
—Want a bullet in your head?

1119
01:40:34,631 --> 01:40:38,151
Gotta show them who’s boss here.

1120
01:40:43,192 --> 01:40:47,016
—Give me the camera!
—No way!

1121
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:51,797
Take my picture, man.

1122
01:40:52,405 --> 01:40:55,056
I can’t work it.

1123
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:56,969
Go ahead.

1124
01:40:57,403 --> 01:41:01,923
—I’ll hold the Beretta.
—Let me try …

1125
01:41:02,575 --> 01:41:05,313
Back off …

1126
01:41:05,487 --> 01:41:09,789
—There’s no click.
—What a bunch of bozos!

1127
01:41:10,224 --> 01:41:13,092
I’m fucked with you guys.

1128
01:41:15,048 --> 01:41:17,655
I have an idea.

1129
01:41:17,829 --> 01:41:22,392
I’ll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1130
01:41:23,262 --> 01:41:27,173
—Here he is.
—Take the camera.

1131
01:41:27,955 --> 01:41:30,432
Well, kid?

1132
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:36,821
Aren’t you a photographer?
Make the camera work. We can’t do it.

1133
01:41:38,603 --> 01:41:40,428
Take our picture.

1134
01:41:45,382 --> 01:41:49,120
—You fucking broke it.
—It wasn’t me.

1135
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:51,423
I found it.

1136
01:41:53,249 --> 01:41:55,508
It has to be wound.

1137
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:02,853
—What’s your name?
—Rocket.

1138
01:42:03,201 --> 01:42:07,112
—Another picture, Rocket.
—How about two rows?

1139
01:42:07,286 --> 01:42:12,327
—What?
—Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1140
01:42:12,979 --> 01:42:17,021
—You’re outside, for Christ’s sake!
—Talk to him nicely, kid.

1141
01:42:17,195 --> 01:42:19,150
Sorry. Move in, please.

1142
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:24,192
Another one.

1143
01:42:28,494 --> 01:42:30,754
—I think the roll’s finished.
—Then show us the pictures.

1144
01:42:31,058 --> 01:42:33,840
—They have to be developed.
—Developed?

1145
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,751
How much is it?

1146
01:42:37,447 --> 01:42:41,836
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1147
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:47,225
—I have to remove the film.
—Keep the camera.

1148
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:52,223
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn’t he? So, it’s yours …

1149
01:42:52,397 --> 01:42:54,265
Thanks.

1150
01:42:56,134 --> 01:43:00,393
Don’t forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1151
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,822
—Pierre!
—What?

1152
01:43:14,126 --> 01:43:17,560
Can you develop this for me?

1153
01:43:18,212 --> 01:43:21,732
I can’t, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1154
01:43:21,949 --> 01:43:24,600
It’s only for the paper’s reporters.
I could risk my job.

1155
01:43:24,817 --> 01:43:26,338
—Pierre?
—Yes, Rogerio?

1156
01:43:26,556 --> 01:43:31,119
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1157
01:43:31,597 --> 01:43:33,944
I’m going to lunch.

1158
01:43:34,248 --> 01:43:38,246
You’re lucky. What size?

1159
01:43:38,507 --> 01:43:41,810
—What?
—For the enlargement, what size?

1160
01:43:42,288 --> 01:43:46,112
Well …. Whatever you think is best.

1161
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:08,103
—Here.
—Thanks.

1162
01:44:11,971 --> 01:44:14,665
I’m in deep shit now.

1163
01:44:16,578 --> 01:44:19,055
I’m as good as dead.

1164
01:44:30,311 --> 01:44:32,440
<i>Someone had signed
my death sentence.</i>

1165
01:44:32,614 --> 01:44:36,178
<i>I wanted to bash the jerk’s face in.</i>

1166
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,348
Are you Marina?
Because of you I’m dead.

1167
01:44:45,608 --> 01:44:47,694
You stole my photos.

1168
01:44:47,825 --> 01:44:51,736
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1169
01:44:52,996 --> 01:44:55,604
Not so loud?
I’ll be killed because of you.

1170
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:58,385
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1171
01:44:58,646 --> 01:45:01,341
There’s nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab …

1172
01:45:01,558 --> 01:45:04,470
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1173
01:45:04,644 --> 01:45:07,903
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1174
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:10,511
—You stole them.
—I did not. Here they are.

1175
01:45:10,728 --> 01:45:15,030
—Give them to me.
—Just a second.

1176
01:45:15,248 --> 01:45:18,420
Here are your photos.

1177
01:45:18,594 --> 01:45:22,375
—Are there any others?
—Calm down. What’s your name?

1178
01:45:22,853 --> 01:45:25,895
—Rocket.
—Rocket?

1179
01:45:26,504 --> 01:45:28,937
Nice to meet you.
I’m Marina.

1180
01:45:29,242 --> 01:45:34,631
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1181
01:45:35,022 --> 01:45:40,150
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1182
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:43,366
—Do you want to be a photographer?
—Yes.

1183
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,408
—Great start! On the front page.
—How’d you get these photos?

1184
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,146
—I live there.
—Rocket …

1185
01:45:49,754 --> 01:45:53,579
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1186
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:59,663
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’l Zé …

1187
01:45:59,967 --> 01:46:04,965
the paper would buy them.
We’d pay you.

1188
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:07,182
Could you?

1189
01:46:07,355 --> 01:46:09,311
I don’t know.

1190
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:10,832
What’s the problem?

1191
01:46:11,006 --> 01:46:13,961
The problem? I can’t go there
anymore at night.

1192
01:46:14,092 --> 01:46:18,481
—And during the day?
—It’s too risky.

1193
01:46:20,046 --> 01:46:25,521
Look, man! They’ve finally
understood that I’m the boss.

1194
01:46:27,303 --> 01:46:28,998
What’s your
photographer-friend’s name?

1195
01:46:29,302 --> 01:46:30,432
Rocket.

1196
01:46:30,693 --> 01:46:33,779
He’s good. I’ll take more
to show the others.

1197
01:46:36,951 --> 01:46:40,298
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1198
01:46:42,601 --> 01:46:45,556
It’s a great opportunity.

1199
01:46:47,425 --> 01:46:48,816
Okay.

1200
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:54,726
—You made the right choice. Very good!
—I’ll give you some film, lenses …

1201
01:46:54,900 --> 01:47:00,637
and even another camera.
I’ll show you the equipment room.

1202
01:47:00,854 --> 01:47:04,157
There’s another problem.

1203
01:47:04,287 --> 01:47:07,329
—What is it?
—Where can I sleep tonight?

1204
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:10,632
I can’t go back now.

1205
01:47:13,501 --> 01:47:18,064
This is a 135mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1206
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:19,281
Far away.

1207
01:47:19,802 --> 01:47:22,323
—Can you measure the light?
—Yes.

1208
01:47:24,409 --> 01:47:27,234
Aren’t you too close?

1209
01:47:29,407 --> 01:47:33,275
<i>I don’t know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.</i>

1210
01:47:33,492 --> 01:47:35,665
<i>Maybe I was going to die …</i>

1211
01:47:35,882 --> 01:47:39,315
<i>but now I had a camera …</i>

1212
01:47:39,533 --> 01:47:42,184
<i>and a chance to become
a photographer.</i>

1213
01:47:42,792 --> 01:47:45,182
Watch out for the dog shit.

1214
01:47:45,574 --> 01:47:48,790
<i>Not to mention that
the night was still young …</i>

1215
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:52,397
—Want something to eat?
—No thank you, ma’am.

1216
01:47:52,614 --> 01:47:58,264
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1217
01:47:59,524 --> 01:48:01,306
Try this …

1218
01:48:20,124 --> 01:48:22,166
It’s time to go to sleep.

1219
01:48:24,209 --> 01:48:27,599
I’ll show you your bed.

1220
01:48:27,816 --> 01:48:30,771
—You have hot water, don’t you?
—Yes.

1221
01:48:30,945 --> 01:48:33,466
You’ve never taken a hot shower?

1222
01:48:33,683 --> 01:48:35,943
—No.
—What do you do?

1223
01:48:36,117 --> 01:48:39,463
We heat up the kettle.

1224
01:48:39,594 --> 01:48:43,418
—Why are you standing there?
—What room do I sleep in?

1225
01:48:43,635 --> 01:48:49,763
Unfortunately, there’s only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1226
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:53,674
<i>I won’t go into the details
of my first sexual experience.</i>

1227
01:48:53,848 --> 01:48:57,021
Just relax …

1228
01:48:57,673 --> 01:48:59,498
<i>Because, elsewhere …</i>

1229
01:48:59,759 --> 01:49:04,452
<i>another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.</i>

1230
01:49:05,887 --> 01:49:08,233
<i>Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape …</i>

1231
01:49:08,364 --> 01:49:10,971
<i>without firing a shot.</i>

1232
01:49:12,405 --> 01:49:18,359
<i>The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.</i>

1233
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:20,011
<i>And in the meantime …</i>

1234
01:49:20,315 --> 01:49:23,705
<i>to eliminate Carrot, Li’l Zé
was investing in munitions.</i>

1235
01:49:23,922 --> 01:49:26,660
<i>He invested heavily,
even if he couldn’t pay …</i>

1236
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:31,354
—Remember the double-barrel?
—I already have it.

1237
01:49:31,614 --> 01:49:36,265
This is a repeater rifle. You don’t have
this one, the Browning.

1238
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:39,568
—It’ll shoot down a plane.
—I’m not shooting down planes.

1239
01:49:39,828 --> 01:49:43,088
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1240
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:46,825
You can’t get them in Brazil.

1241
01:49:46,999 --> 01:49:48,998
My arse, Uncle Sam.

1242
01:49:51,953 --> 01:49:54,126
I have a solution.

1243
01:49:54,344 --> 01:49:56,082
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1244
01:49:56,299 --> 01:50:00,776
It’s like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1245
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:04,383
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1246
01:50:04,557 --> 01:50:07,512
—It depends.
—It depends, my arse!

1247
01:50:07,642 --> 01:50:10,163
Trying to fuck me over?

1248
01:50:10,598 --> 01:50:12,336
I’ll fuck you over first.

1249
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,465
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1250
01:50:16,595 --> 01:50:19,202
—What do I tell the boss?
—That’s your problem.

1251
01:50:19,507 --> 01:50:23,679
—You’ll think of something.
—You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1252
01:50:24,113 --> 01:50:27,373
Beat it, fatso.

1253
01:50:27,503 --> 01:50:29,155
<i>Li’l Zé had made a big mistake.</i>

1254
01:50:29,415 --> 01:50:33,718
<i>He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.</i>

1255
01:50:33,935 --> 01:50:36,108
<i>And they don’t joke around.</i>

1256
01:50:37,629 --> 01:50:40,193
Have you seen this?

1257
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,931
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1258
01:50:43,192 --> 01:50:46,060
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1259
01:50:46,365 --> 01:50:48,581
They’ll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1260
01:50:48,798 --> 01:50:53,318
Think I’m going
to give you away?

1261
01:50:56,534 --> 01:50:59,185
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

1262
01:50:59,402 --> 01:51:01,532
But don’t fuck-up again.

1263
01:51:08,398 --> 01:51:10,571
Charlie!

1264
01:51:11,267 --> 01:51:13,092
Come here!

1265
01:51:13,353 --> 01:51:14,830
Listen …

1266
01:51:15,004 --> 01:51:17,786
you tell him …

1267
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:22,653
Let’s go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1268
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:36,386
Come here, kids!

1269
01:51:38,472 --> 01:51:42,036
—Do you like chicken?
—It depends.

1270
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:45,600
We’ll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1271
01:51:45,774 --> 01:51:49,120
I have a present for you.

1272
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,944
Here …

1273
01:51:54,813 --> 01:51:56,812
A big one for you.

1274
01:51:56,986 --> 01:51:58,942
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1275
01:51:59,202 --> 01:52:03,896
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1276
01:52:04,157 --> 01:52:06,808
Then can we hold-up
anyone we want?

1277
01:52:07,025 --> 01:52:09,676
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1278
01:52:09,893 --> 01:52:11,719
—More or less.
—More or less?

1279
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:17,499
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1280
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:21,019
I know. You do it like this.

1281
01:52:27,103 --> 01:52:29,581
<i>The Beginning of The End</i>

1282
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:39,229
Get that chicken!

1283
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,700
C’mon, let’s go.

1284
01:52:53,874 --> 01:52:55,873
If Li’l Zé catches you,
he’ll kill you.

1285
01:52:57,873 --> 01:53:00,654
Yeah, well, he’s gotta
find me first.

1286
01:53:08,564 --> 01:53:11,867
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1287
01:53:14,518 --> 01:53:15,995
Shit! The cops!

1288
01:53:16,212 --> 01:53:18,255
Hell, don’t fucking run off!

1289
01:53:18,429 --> 01:53:20,298
Give me that.

1290
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:33,944
Hey, Melon-head! You fucking fag!

1291
01:53:34,118 --> 01:53:37,334
Get the hell out of here!

1292
01:53:37,508 --> 01:53:38,855
Coward!

1293
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:41,071
Arsehole!

1294
01:53:41,984 --> 01:53:44,896
Come on, let them kill each other.

1295
01:53:45,113 --> 01:53:47,851
They can fuck themselves.

1296
01:53:56,065 --> 01:53:58,585
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1297
01:54:00,063 --> 01:54:02,323
What are you waiting for?

1298
01:54:23,835 --> 01:54:25,617
What’s happening?

1299
01:54:25,965 --> 01:54:27,312
Shit!

1300
01:54:40,437 --> 01:54:42,392
Let’s go!

1301
01:55:14,335 --> 01:55:16,986
Run! Run!

1302
01:55:17,247 --> 01:55:20,028
Watch out!

1303
01:55:20,245 --> 01:55:23,331
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1304
01:55:42,844 --> 01:55:45,408
Knockout Ned!

1305
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:01,923
Take it easy. Don’t move.

1306
01:56:02,227 --> 01:56:03,922
It hurts, man.

1307
01:56:04,096 --> 01:56:06,747
Easy does it, kid.

1308
01:56:07,616 --> 01:56:10,311
Why did you join this fucking war?

1309
01:56:10,528 --> 01:56:13,266
Knockout Ned!
Li’l Zé has been hit. Come on!

1310
01:56:14,613 --> 01:56:17,568
Wait here, I’ll help you.
Just hold on.

1311
01:56:26,782 --> 01:56:31,084
<i>—What’s your name?
—My name’s Otto.</i>

1312
01:56:38,168 --> 01:56:41,123
I want to get my father’s murderer.

1313
01:57:05,678 --> 01:57:08,199
Knockout Ned! Li’l Zé has been hit.
Come on!

1314
01:57:09,502 --> 01:57:13,892
I’ll help you.
Just hold on there.

1315
01:57:53,092 --> 01:57:56,395
The fucking cops!

1316
01:57:56,612 --> 01:57:58,003
On the ground!

1317
01:57:58,220 --> 01:58:00,089
—Hands over your head.
—Don’t move!

1318
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:14,604
—You’re the one I want.
—You’re finished, pal.

1319
01:58:14,822 --> 01:58:16,995
Handcuff him.

1320
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,421
Rocket, where are you going?

1321
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:38,203
I got something to clear up.

1322
01:59:09,624 --> 01:59:11,189
Okay, lovebirds?

1323
01:59:11,362 --> 01:59:15,143
Come on, Li’l Zé,
let’s go settle our scores.

1324
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:19,967
Not you. You’re a present
for the media.

1325
01:59:55,952 --> 01:59:57,429
Does it come to 10,000?

1326
01:59:57,603 --> 02:00:00,689
Almost. That’s all I have.

1327
02:00:00,906 --> 02:00:04,209
—That’s all there was, Chief.
—We searched everywhere.

1328
02:00:04,426 --> 02:00:06,990
Let him go.

1329
02:00:11,467 --> 02:00:14,292
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1330
02:00:14,509 --> 02:00:20,376
Fill it up. You’ll owe us
the rest.

1331
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,373
Fucking war!

1332
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:31,154
Knockout Ned is dead
and I’m dead broke!

1333
02:00:31,371 --> 02:00:33,631
You’re fucked, eh?

1334
02:00:33,848 --> 02:00:35,239
Kids …

1335
02:00:35,587 --> 02:00:39,324
we’ll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1336
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:42,410
—Your business, Li’l Zé?
—What’s your problem, kid?

1337
02:00:42,627 --> 02:00:45,322
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1338
02:00:45,408 --> 02:00:47,060
A Soviet attack!

1339
02:00:54,318 --> 02:00:57,316
The business is ours!

1340
02:01:51,576 --> 02:01:55,921
<i>This picture of the hood
will get me the job.</i>

1341
02:01:58,312 --> 02:02:00,181
<i>This one will make me famous.</i>

1342
02:02:00,311 --> 02:02:02,962
<i>It’ll even make the cover
of a magazine.</i>

1343
02:02:05,309 --> 02:02:08,916
<i>I won’t have to worry
about Li’l Zé anymore.</i>

1344
02:02:10,785 --> 02:02:13,523
But the cops?

1345
02:02:21,041 --> 02:02:25,430
<i>Gangster, Self-styled “Boss”
of The City of God, Shot Dead</i>

1346
02:02:27,821 --> 02:02:32,427
This photo could’ve gotten
us killed?

1347
02:02:32,688 --> 02:02:34,209
I think so.

1348
02:02:34,426 --> 02:02:37,034
At least it got you a job.

1349
02:02:37,251 --> 02:02:41,076
—Not a job, an internship.
—It pays a little, doesn’t it?

1350
02:02:41,337 --> 02:02:43,814
A little.

1351
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:46,986
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1352
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:49,550
—More or less.
—You didn’t like it?

1353
02:02:49,724 --> 02:02:52,158
I don’t think journalists know how
to screw.

1354
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:53,331
Yeah, I guess so.

1355
02:02:53,505 --> 02:02:56,026
Cocoa robbed three houses in Barra.

1356
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:57,721
Better kill him.

1357
02:02:57,981 --> 02:02:59,720
Who shot Roger?

1358
02:02:59,807 --> 02:03:02,240
—It was Beef.
—Kill that fucker.

1359
02:03:02,414 --> 02:03:04,761
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1360
02:03:04,891 --> 02:03:08,455
—What about Cherry?
—Let’s go. Us two, and three others …

1361
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:10,411
It’s a deal.

1362
02:03:10,715 --> 02:03:13,323
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1363
02:03:13,453 --> 02:03:16,669
No, but if they come,
we’ll kill them.

1364
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:21,363
—Who knows how to write?
—Me, sort of.

1365
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:24,579
Let’s make a black list.
We’ll kill them all.

1366
02:03:24,752 --> 02:03:28,316
—Put fucking Nightowl on there.
—And Croquet.

1367
02:03:28,533 --> 02:03:30,011
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1368
02:03:30,315 --> 02:03:32,227
And China-Man,
he thinks he’s hot stuff.

1369
02:03:32,401 --> 02:03:35,400
—And Claudio.
—Where’s Giant?

1370
02:03:35,704 --> 02:03:38,399
Come on, Giant!

1371
02:03:52,784 --> 02:03:56,521
<i>I forgot to say,
my name isn’t Rocket anymore.</i>

1372
02:03:56,695 --> 02:03:58,998

1376
02:04:27,247 --> 02:04:30,159
<i>On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.</i>

1377
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:33,418
<i>Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.</i>

1378
02:04:33,592 --> 02:04:37,330
<i>Just knowing me is enough …</i>

1379
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:41,371
<i>just being my friend …</i>

1380
02:04:41,545 --> 02:04:45,543
<i>If he thinks someone knows me,
he’ll kill them.</i>

1381
02:04:45,761 --> 02:04:47,586
<i>The police don’t go in there?</i>

1382
02:04:47,803 --> 02:04:53,149
<i>They go after me, not him.</i>

1383
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:58,364
<i>I’ve been in jail three times,
while he goes on …</i>

1384
02:04:58,538 --> 02:05:01,102
<i>killing undisturbed.</i>

1385
02:05:01,319 --> 02:05:04,057
<i>And they don’t arrest him.</i>

1386
02:05:04,405 --> 02:05:06,969
<i>Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.</i>

1387
02:05:07,143 --> 02:05:12,010
<i>Police Chief Guedes has promised to
arrest both gangs in the City of God.</i>
