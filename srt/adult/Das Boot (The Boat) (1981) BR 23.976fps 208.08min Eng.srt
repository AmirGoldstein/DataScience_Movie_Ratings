1
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,148
Our bosun's mate.

2
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,111
He's soaked to the gills.

3
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,618
The road's closed.

4
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,453
Who are those pigs?

5
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,709
The road's clear.
Coming through!

6
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,970
That's their fireboat drill.

7
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,472
They're all boys off our boat.

8
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!

9
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,206
Captain.

10
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,674
Merkel's guys.
They ship out tomorrow too.

11
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,355
Okay, sailors!
Let's go set that cathouse on fire!

12
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,775
Just don't miss your mark!

13
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,236
Stuff some season's greetings
in there!

14
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,280
Scared fuckers.

15
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,033
They need sex
like the infantry needs alcohol.

16
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,870
What's going on here?

17
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,872
Good luck!

18
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,882
Captain!

19
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,384
My 2nd officer.

20
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,766
This is Lieutenant Werner,
naval war correspondent.

21
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,435
He'll ship out with us.

22
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,066
He'll report anything of interest.

23
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,736
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

24
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,571
Good evening.

25
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,079
This way, lieutenant.

26
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,581
U-boat crews need relaxation.

27
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,750
Good evening.

28
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:34,918
Two beers.

29
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,129
Yes, captain.

30
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,104
Where's Thomsen?

31
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,857
Doesn't he want
to celebrate his medal?

32
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,155
Any news from your wife?

33
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,496
No personal calls allowed
till after 10 p.m.

34
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,127
Two beers.

35
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,055
Reporting back from U-96.

36
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,559
Munitions and provisions aboard,
ready to put to sea.

37
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,144
Thanks, 1st.

38
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,062
Something else, captain.

39
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,483
On my way here...

40
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,694
...some of the crew harassed me.

41
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,824
They actually-

42
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,494
An incredible incident--

43
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,830
They--

44
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,916
They pissed on you.

45
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,336
Yes.

46
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
Me too.

47
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,178
Just a minute!

48
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,223
Attention, please!

49
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,018
Let's give
our newly decorated officer...

50
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,394
...Captain Thomsen...

51
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,063
...three cheers!

52
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,077
That's Thomsen for you.

53
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,412
One of the old guard.

54
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,747
Always drunk now.

55
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,639
My respects, Thomsen!

56
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,898
Quiet in this whorehouse!

57
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,076
A toast to our wonderful...

58
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,412
...abstaining...

59
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,331
...womanless Fuhrer.

60
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,086
Who rose gloriously...

61
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,422
...from apprentice painter...

62
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,591
...to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

63
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,637
What? Isn't it true?

64
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,100
He's the great naval expert...

65
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,812
...who took it upon himself...

66
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,606
...in his wisdom--

67
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,784
How's it go again?

68
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,499
Who's been showing
that English bedwetter...

69
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,503
...that cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill...

70
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,299
...where to go stick...

71
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,719
...his cigars!

72
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,220
Sorry.

73
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,390
See you tomorrow.
I've got a call to make.

74
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,616
It's not like the old gang.

75
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,039
These are so green and eager.

76
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,626
Wet behind the ears.

77
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,087
Braggarts.

78
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,385
Cheeks together,
balls in their hands...

79
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,639
...and belief
in the Fuhrer in their eyes.

80
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,727
They'll calm down soon enough.

81
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,131
You're a pig's ass!

82
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,116
Fight! Win! Or Die!

83
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,967
Come on, Phillip, get up!

84
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,470
Help me here!

85
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,896
I wanted to...

86
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,564
...really...

87
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,651
...screw my brains out--

88
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,237
I am not in the condition
to fuck.

89
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,821
It's all right.

90
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,588
That's Thomsen's boat.

91
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,840
Equipment checks okay?

92
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,177
The starboard propeller had
a bent blade.

93
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,932
That's what caused whining
on silent runs.

94
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,769
We have a brand-new propeller
now, captain.

95
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,762
Our boat.

96
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,056
Crew at attention!

97
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,229
Captain's revue, eyes left.

98
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,741
Crew reporting for duty.

99
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,076
All decks ready to sail.

100
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,579
Thank you, 1st officer.

101
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,754
At ease!

102
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,273
Well, men...

103
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,527
Everything okay?

104
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,280
Yes, captain!

105
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,785
We have a guest.

106
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,872
Lieutenant Werner.

107
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,957
Naval correspondent.

108
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,296
He wants to look around...

109
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,848
...to watch
respectable German heroes.

110
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,726
Act accordingly.

111
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,814
Man your stations.

112
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,033
Hail and victory and sink them all!

113
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,981
Pick up those vegetables.
This is no grocery store!

114
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,900
Command post.

115
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,819
Torpedo workshop and storage.

116
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,780
Shape up and your mugs
will make the newspaper!

117
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,075
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Follow me.

118
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,744
This is our shit house.

119
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,746
One hole for fifty men.

120
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,081
The other's full of provisions.

121
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,085
More space for food
than for shit. Some logic.

122
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,338
Chief petty officer's.

123
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,256
My home, so to speak.

124
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,342
Here's the officers' mess.

125
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,512
Don't stow stuff that way!

126
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,474
It's nice in here.

127
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,767
Where are you?

128
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,936
Sorry, coming. May I?

129
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,189
Careful!

130
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,443
Here's the radio room.
Over here, the control room.

131
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,653
Just what we need.

132
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,363
The control room.

133
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,115
The boat's command centre.

134
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,538
This leads to quarters.

135
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,544
Gotta move this stuff.

136
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,797
Morning, lieutenant.

137
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,634
Petty officers sleep here.

138
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,344
Twelve men.

139
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,973
Two men share most bunks,
depending on their duties.

140
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,894
If one's on guard, the next one sleeps
in the other's stink. Right?

141
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,481
This is your bunk.

142
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,067
Just for you, our guest.

143
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,194
That's for you too.

144
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,989
Your oxygen mask.
Very important!

145
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,367
Not much good except
in calm seas.

146
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,328
It comes in handy
when the diesel reeks.

147
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,164
Or when Frenssen farts.

148
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,709
Come along.

149
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,836
Coming through!

150
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,589
This is the galley.

151
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,049
And this is Johann, the ghost.

152
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,349
Hey, Johann,
everything greased up?

153
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,520
Man on bridge?

154
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,546
Take photos of the crew returning...

155
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,548
...not putting out to sea.

156
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,383
Why?

157
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,555
They'll have beards by then.

158
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:14,403
It would shame the Brits
to see mere boys give them hell.

159
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,573
Baby faces...

160
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,744
...who should still
suck Mama's breast.

161
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,585
I feel ancient around these kids.

162
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,675
Like I'm on some Children's Crusade.

163
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,104
Permission to pass?

164
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,386
You're from Mexico?

165
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,139
Yes, south of Mexico City.

166
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,474
Nice?

167
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,685
Yes, sir.

168
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,813
Great climate,
due to the high altitude.

169
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,493
You came a long way.

170
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,997
As a German,
it was a matter of course.

171
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,335
What did you do there?

172
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,214
I worked on my step-parents'
plantation.

173
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,594
The boss' son?

174
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,846
You could put it that way.

175
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,224
Stand by,
first watch and engine watch.

176
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,518
Excuse me.

177
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,023
Permission to pass?

178
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,535
Reporting to bridge watch.

179
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,545
Rigid jawbones, our 1st officer.

180
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,926
He'll march anywhere.

181
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,387
A model of ideology.

182
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,558
He's so tense,
he could crack nuts with his ass.

183
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,233
Watch out. Eggs.

184
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,947
- Man on bridge?
- Yes.

185
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,075
Alarm!

186
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,590
All hands forward!

187
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,509
Come on, let's go!

188
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,094
Wake up, you guys!

189
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,931
Move that body.
Hop, hop! Let's go!

190
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,523
I'll kick your asses till they bleed!

191
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,860
That's an alarm, damn it!

192
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,695
This ain't a cruise ship!

193
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,300
Blow main dive tank.

194
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,014
Stern to 10.

195
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,986
April Fools.

196
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,863
Exercise is good for you.

197
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,073
Can't let no moss grow.

198
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,200
Practise drill.

199
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,079
Steady as she goes.

200
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,082
Bow up 15. Stem up 10.

201
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,085
Both up.

202
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,176
- Boat trimmed.
- Close main vents.

203
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,181
Vents closed.

204
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,266
Deeper, chief.

205
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,936
Let's see if these valves are tight.

206
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,023
Bow down 15, Stem up 10.

207
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,618
The shipyard rates it to 90 metres.

208
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,581
But we can go deeper.

209
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,804
Of course, there's a limit.

210
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,557
We can only take
so much pressure...

211
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:40,312
...before the boat's crushed.

212
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,159
Secure upper hatches.

213
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,921
- It's water pressure.
- Yes, of course.

214
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,306
Deeper.

215
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,936
140 metres.

216
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,528
It's gotta take it.

217
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,030
150.

218
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,456
160 metres.

219
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,671
That's all today.

220
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,382
Surface.

221
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,551
Bow up 10. Stem up 5.

222
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,888
Your girl?

223
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,603
French?

224
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,533
You know that florist next
to the Café À l'Ami Pierrot?

225
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
Where?

226
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,037
À l'Ami Pierrot.

227
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,206
Yeah, sure...

228
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,874
...the two salesgirls...

229
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,585
...Jeannette and...
What's her name?

230
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,046
Françoise.

231
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,717
We're engaged.

232
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,597
Secretly, of course.

233
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,064
May I?

234
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,239
Really very pretty.

235
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,829
What's wrong?

236
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,252
She's pregnant.

237
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,465
But...

238
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,428
...you know what that means.

239
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,598
Once the Partisans find out...

240
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,932
...her kid's half-German--

241
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,269
What can I do?

242
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,272
She definitely wants it.

243
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,281
You've got a problem.

244
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:12,209
Those guys in Berlin got nothing
but insults for Churchill.

245
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,921
How's it go again?

246
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,261
"Drunkard"...

247
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,347
..."Guzzler"...

248
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,017
..."Paralytic."

249
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,731
He's sending a lot of heat our way
for a paralyzed drunk.

250
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,276
Nonetheless...

251
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,569
...we'll force him to his knees.

252
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,446
That is my firm belief.

253
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,868
Listen, smart guy...

254
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,040
...he's far from being on his knees.

255
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,379
Wonder how many ships
get through.

256
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:02,384
Especially now, while we're staring
at the walls and waiting.

257
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,555
Where are our planes and scouts,
Herr Göring?

258
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,099
The enemy's got plenty.

259
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,063
Hot air, that's all that comes out
of that fat slob.

260
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,238
Braggarts, nothing but braggarts.

261
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,740
All of them.

262
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,957
Go on...

263
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,668
...take it down.

264
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,836
Notes...

265
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,088
...for your "Heroes' Epic"...

266
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,260
...and the propaganda machine.

267
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,681
Where's the music?

268
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:54,853
Our Hitler Youth leader here
could play us a record.

269
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,318
That "Tipperary" song,
if you please!

270
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,960
Hey, now we're the Royal Navy.

271
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,807
This record won't hurt...

272
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,725
...your ideological edifice.

273
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,412
Shut that bulkhead, you cockroach!

274
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,665
What an asshole.

275
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,876
We should've used him for ballast.

276
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,172
One day I'll rip his ass
up to his ears...

277
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,009
...till he can watch himself
through his own asshole.

278
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,514
Morning.

279
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,186
This stinks.

280
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,691
It's sweaty socks and hair grease...

281
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,443
...Pilgrim's special mix.

282
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,455
Tastes like shit, eh?

283
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,707
Those scrambled eggs...

284
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,295
...taste like baby poo-poo.

285
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,216
Wanna raise chickens on the boat?

286
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,304
And ducks in the bilge.
Tiny ones.

287
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,433
We could feed them
green boogers.

288
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,894
- You pig's ass.
- But why?

289
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,229
They'd love some.

290
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,565
Every morning...

291
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,817
...fat, fresh boogers.

292
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,603
"Personal hygiene," four letters?

293
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,439
Bath.

294
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,111
Thanks.

295
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,539
"Innermost affection," four letters?

296
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,793
Love.

297
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,170
Exactly.

298
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,392
Not too intellectual around here.

299
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,820
Your radiogram, captain.

300
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,165
Hold on.

301
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,404
This could work.

302
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,792
A new course?

303
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,382
Wait and see.

304
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,139
May I see the radiogram?

305
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:52,067
"Convoy reported,
coordinates AK 22..."

306
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,944
"...general course about 60 degrees..."

307
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,739
"...at 8 nautical miles"
"From U-37."

308
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,618
U-37 is Marten's boat.
He's after a convoy.

309
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,920
Too far away. Can't make it.

310
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,758
Damn this waiting!

311
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,260
Will we ever see some action?

312
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,104
Move it, you turtle!

313
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,189
Let's hear your bones crack!

314
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,442
Pull them out of the cosy Lady.

315
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,611
Pretty big johnnies, huh?

316
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,364
Move it, lazybones!
The press!

317
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,283
Let me get that. Hold it. Very nice.

318
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,661
Greased up nice with Vaseline...

319
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,955
...and rammed back into the Lady.

320
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,957
Don't let me get in your way.

321
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,292
One more! Good.

322
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,630
And another.

323
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,516
A bit to the left.
Maybe a profile shot.

324
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,394
Another pose, a little to the--

325
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,408
Who did that?

326
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,496
Who did that?

327
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,546
Tell me...

328
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,467
...you got hairs in your nose?

329
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,844
Why?

330
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,764
Because I've got some in my ass.

331
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,309
We can tie them together.

332
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,445
Françoise, my love...

333
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:46,574
...this is my 14th letter,
but you've yet to see one.

334
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,839
20th day at sea.

335
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,426
Feeling foggy and overfed.
It's all so crazy.

336
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,929
Alarm!

337
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,181
All ahead full!

338
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,310
Flood tanks!

339
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,023
I saw a shadow off starboard
through the rain.

340
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,276
Take her down to 30 metres.

341
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,445
Stern up slowly, bow down 10.

342
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,326
Anything off starboard?

343
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,786
Propeller sounds.

344
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,716
110 degrees.

345
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,557
Way aft of us.

346
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,819
Contact getting fainter.

347
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,829
Fading fast.

348
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,176
We'll stay under.

349
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,012
Steer 120 degrees.

350
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,270
That's a fast, lone ship.

351
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,190
We've got no chance in the dark.

352
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,801
"Attention to personal hygiene
and dress are not just appearances."

353
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,096
"It reflects an upright,
clean interior..."

354
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,099
"...thus influencing the surroundings."

355
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,227
"The true officer is unpretentious..."

356
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,313
"...in character and wardrobe..."

357
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,900
"...which was not always the case..."

358
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,070
"...when superiors were more lenient..."

359
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:33,241
"...because a German lieutenant
always knew how to die."

360
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,327
Comfy place, huh?

361
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,081
No mail, no phones.

362
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,168
A well-ventilated boat.

363
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,088
Attractive wood panelling.

364
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,261
Free home cooking.

365
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,972
We're sitting in clover.

366
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,600
Like horse droppings.

367
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,522
It sits in clover too.

368
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,692
It doesn't worry about anything...

369
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,028
...and it gets to let off steam.

370
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,511
U-boat special cocktail.

371
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,972
Envious?

372
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,319
Turn it off!

373
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,675
These latest radiograms...

374
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,014
"Dived avoiding aircraft."

375
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,392
"Dived avoiding destroyer
depth charges."

376
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,738
Those Brits
don't make mistakes anymore.

377
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,707
Watch fuel flow!

378
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,417
Okay.

379
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,300
Let's get to the diesel room!

380
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,237
Watch out!

381
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,406
- Tough times, huh?
- What's up?

382
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,324
U-32, Berthold'S boat...

383
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,911
...discovered a convoy.
We'll be there in 10 hours.

384
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,004
Listen up.

385
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,091
We're in pursuit
of a convoy tracked by U-32.

386
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,428
Expect contact at 1800 hours.

387
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,098
I hope we blast off some eels.

388
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,808
It'll clear some space!

389
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,605
More than 30 freighters!

390
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,150
Berthold better not attack now.

391
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,111
Ought to stay close
until the other boats arrive.

392
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,492
There is nothing more beautiful
than a submarine...

393
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,453
...and a sailboat.

394
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,789
There are no better lines
than those of a sailboat.

395
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,292
I sailed on a 3-masted schooner once.

396
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,211
Gorgeous ship.

397
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,505
It had holds the size
of a cathedral!

398
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,182
That burns some fuel, huh?

399
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,018
Asshole.

400
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,402
Shitty fog, damn it!

401
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,038
Watch out or else we'll sail
right by them.

402
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,167
Should have made Contact by now.

403
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,836
Why's there no signal
from Berthold?

404
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,008
Why no word from headquarters?

405
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,433
Visibility nil, captain.
It's useless!

406
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,110
Prepare to take her down!

407
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,407
Get below!

408
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,116
Take her down to 30 metres.

409
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,076
Bow up 10.

410
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,245
Stern down 5.

411
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,248
Bow zero.

412
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,250
Stern zero.

413
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,756
What's happening?
Why are we diving?

414
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,760
Hydrophone check.

415
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:30,931
You hear more down here
than you can see up there.

416
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,473
No contact, nothing?

417
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,570
Nothing at all?

418
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,046
Contact, bearing 60 degrees.
Quite faint.

419
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,063
Depth charges.

420
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,111
They're blasting someone.

421
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,913
What's their exact bearing now?

422
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,588
Forty-five degrees, moving right.

423
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,925
Moving away.

424
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,433
Surface!

425
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,435
Steer 330 degrees.

426
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,440
Entry for your log book.

427
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,443
Commenced operation
despite weather.

428
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,979
Damn this weather!

429
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,314
What's it look like?

430
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,983
Just a moment.

431
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,822
Enemy's position here,
if they haven't zig-zagged.

432
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:19,577
Vessel! Starboard ahead!

433
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,502
Forty degrees, over that way!

434
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,547
See it.

435
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,846
That's no freighter.

436
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,934
That's a damn destroyer.

437
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,395
Approaching.

438
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,939
Get below.

439
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,655
Flood tanks!

440
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,960
Periscope depth.

441
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,692
Stand by battle stations.

442
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,826
Move!

443
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,039
Go! Go! Faster!

444
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,883
Watch out, chief.

445
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,979
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

446
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,072
He wants to attack the destroyer.
That's madness in this weather.

447
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,368
Watch our depth!

448
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,871
Bow up 2.

449
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,039
Stern down 2.

450
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,836
Gently.

451
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,506
Bow average...

452
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,425
...13.5 metres.

453
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,515
Open torpedo hatches.

454
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,240
Enemy speed: 12.

455
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,076
Bow angle: 30.

456
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,704
Range: 6,000.

457
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,873
Depth: 2.

458
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:58,879
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread shots from tubes 1 and 3.

459
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,881
Angle: 3 degrees.

460
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,721
Tubes 1 to 4 ready to fire.

461
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,956
Damn.

462
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,477
Close hatches! Dive fast!

463
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,153
Depth charges!

464
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,296
Quick, get fuses!

465
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,716
Check outboard valves.

466
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,319
Control room secured.

467
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,155
All clear forward.

468
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,328
No serious damages.

469
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,003
They actually spotted our periscope.

470
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,343
Hard to believe in this heavy sea.

471
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,373
Getting any louder?

472
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,877
The same. Ahead of us.

473
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:15,993
It's pulling further ahead.
295 degrees.

474
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,161
Left full rudder.

475
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,292
Rudder is left full.

476
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,461
Steer due north.

477
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,630
Deeper.

478
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,508
Bow down 15. Stem up 10.

479
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,677
Pump 200 litres forward.

480
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,941
All ahead one-third.

481
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,825
Now it all turns psychological,
gentlemen.

482
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,410
Check torpedo tubes!

483
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,763
Stay calm, men.

484
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,932
That ain't nothing yet.

485
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,904
Kill the lights.

486
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,413
Silent run.

487
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,500
Both engines 50 r.p.m.

488
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,812
Contact closing.

489
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,731
Ahead, 52 degrees.

490
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,151
Approaching fast.

491
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,569
Midships.

492
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,572
All full ahead. Right full rudder.

493
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,140
Heading straight for us!

494
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:39,070
Those aren't amateurs
up there. Deeper!

495
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,238
Bow down 20.

496
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,365
Stern up 5.

497
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,277
Destroyer approaching.
Getting louder.

498
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,571
Deeper, quickly.

499
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,509
Don't worry.

500
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,886
It's just creaking.

501
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,854
Deeper.

502
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,564
Stern up 15.

503
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,934
Tighten that flange!

504
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,480
Higher! To 150 metres!

505
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,399
Hurry! Bow up 20!

506
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,529
Come on, tighter!

507
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,533
Push already! Do it, do it!

508
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,183
Hull valves secured.

509
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,934
Both level.

510
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,108
Boat trimmed at 150 metres.

511
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,748
Getting closer.

512
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:37,916
New approach.

513
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,305
Come on, come on.

514
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,158
They're above us.

515
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,288
Directly above us.

516
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,359
Contact fading to starboard.

517
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,456
Twenty-two.

518
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,466
Twenty-three.

519
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,885
Far away.

520
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,145
Fading aft.

521
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,489
Barely audible.

522
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,805
No more contact.

523
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,237
That's the end of that.

524
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,202
Silent run.

525
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,664
Both engines, 50 r.p.m.

526
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,324
From my private collection.

527
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,924
Engine room damages?

528
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,926
A lot of smashed stuff.

529
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,263
- Can you fix it?
- It's in the works.

530
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,975
Make sure it's done right.

531
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,145
I've got a hunch we're going
to see action.

532
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,429
It's been almost an hour.

533
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,058
We got rid of them, captain.

534
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,226
We'll see.

535
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,731
Maybe they're just lying
in wait for us...

536
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,568
...until we feel safe enough
to surface.

537
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,823
These guys aren't stupid.

538
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,410
Continue silent run.
We'll surface at dark.

539
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,246
Then we'll see.

540
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,085
She's coming up fast.

541
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,797
Hydrophone check at 30 metres.

542
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,343
She's at 30 metres.

543
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,029
Periscope depth.

544
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,495
Periscope clear.

545
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,165
Stern down 5.

546
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,333
Coming UP-

547
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,502
Stern up 3.

548
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,213
Zero.

549
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,230
Surface.

550
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,690
Blow tanks.

551
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,256
What a cutie pie.

552
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,884
If Mama could see you now.

553
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,248
Quiet in this whorehouse!

554
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,924
Bad news, guys.

555
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,635
What's going on?

556
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,098
Soccer. Schalke.

557
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,645
We lost, 5-0.

558
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,318
No chance to make the semi-finals.

559
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,281
I can't believe this shit!

560
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,625
Drop them.

561
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,233
You pig.

562
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,652
Crabs.

563
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,614
A whole army of crabs.

564
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,451
They'll eat little guys
like you to the bone.

565
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:41,042
Give that hussy some puffy!

566
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,758
Permission to pass?

567
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,826
Ought to shave this pig, huh?

568
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,335
What's that in your eyebrows?

569
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,005
Pardon?

570
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,217
You'd better see the medic.

571
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,344
You've got the crabs.

572
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,396
Are you joking?

573
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,066
Once they crawl up there,
it's really far gone.

574
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,587
Number One.

575
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,297
Lieutenant?

576
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,841
Where's the medic?

577
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,552
In the bow.

578
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,601
This can't be true!

579
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,833
Watch your sector.

580
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,295
What?

581
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,380
Pull yourself together!

582
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,468
Have you gone crazy?

583
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,768
Have you heard?

584
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,311
Dufte is engaged.

585
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,647
Poor woman!

586
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,107
Asshole!

587
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,359
I thought he only jerks off.

588
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,697
Yeah, breed him
with a chimp at the zoo.

589
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,576
Here are photos of his lady.

590
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,911
Give them back!

591
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,085
I can't believe it.

592
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,878
You screw this bag?

593
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,920
This boat can take it.

594
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,384
You should be
in a storm on a schooner.

595
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,887
You don't feel a thing down here.

596
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,317
Compass.

597
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,540
The boat's heaving to starboard.

598
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,750
I can barely keep her on course.

599
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,837
Don't worry about it.

600
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,677
We're hardly moving.

601
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,763
We're just burning fuel.

602
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,857
Prepare to dive.

603
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,484
Diving stations!

604
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,737
Flooding tanks.

605
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,739
All main vents clear.

606
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,968
No tales of victory, huh?

607
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,933
Just some position reports.

608
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,645
SOS calls from far-off boats.

609
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:42,152
If anyone breaks a rudder
in this weather...

610
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,867
...they better start praying.

611
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,750
The sea can't drown us, though.

612
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,463
There's no ship
as seaworthy as ours.

613
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,980
Play that record.

614
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,817
You know which one.

615
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,142
Watch out!

616
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,414
Man overboard!

617
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,481
Hold on!

618
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:45,961
Move! Hold onto him!

619
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,714
Put him on the chart box!

620
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,224
Get the medic case!

621
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,976
Damn it!

622
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,395
The medic case, damn it!

623
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,105
Prepare to dive!

624
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:18,035
"A military leader leads
through self-discipline."

625
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:21,955
"Without his example,
education is impossible."

626
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:25,584
Three broken ribs,
one open wound.

627
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,378
Could be worse.

628
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,800
Shitty month.

629
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,680
Real shitty.

630
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,600
Mildew is good for you.

631
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,940
It's the next best thing...

632
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,151
...to fresh lettuce.

633
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:58,492
Let's be grateful
for anything that grows here.

634
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,920
They'll have snow back home now.

635
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,263
Funny.

636
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,352
I haven't seen snow in years.

637
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:29,982
May I?

638
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,441
By all means.

639
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,165
Your wife?

640
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,653
Over there, ahead!

641
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:06,119
Captain, U-boat, port ahead!

642
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:10,749
German boat, German U-boat!

643
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,673
Bearing 350 degrees.
Almost straight ahead!

644
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,224
God, you're right!

645
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,770
All engines stop.
Get that signal lamp up!

646
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,431
That's Thomsen!

647
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,143
All back half.

648
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:32,789
Happy hunting, you old sea dog!

649
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,092
Phillip, my friend.

650
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,596
So they kicked you out here again.

651
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,814
God damn mess!

652
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,321
Only 12 boats in the Atlantic.

653
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:08,033
From Greenland to the Azores,
a lousy dozen!

654
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,954
And here we are,
almost ramming into each other.

655
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,167
Sixty metres. Boat is trimmed.

656
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,382
Something's wrong here.

657
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,763
Our position's correct?

658
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,140
More or less, captain.

659
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,018
What's that supposed to mean?

660
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:38,563
Not one sun shot in two weeks.

661
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,233
And we've drifted in this storm.

662
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,361
Hard to calculate.

663
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,871
That's just great.

664
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,792
All of us "more or less"
in position...

665
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,710
...and it'll happen.

666
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:05,215
Two boats in one place
and gaping holes in the route.

667
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:09,386
The British can slide
a whole fleet through.

668
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:21,648
Here in the middle of the sea,
it's always another story.

669
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,527
I hope you're taking notes.

670
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,446
Maybe you can clue headquarters in.

671
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,949
Surely, you have better
connections than me.

672
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,872
You think so, huh?

673
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,484
What's going on?

674
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,153
Convoy.

675
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,629
- Man on bridge?
- Affirmative.

676
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:20,100
Convoy putting to sea.
Five columns.

677
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,310
Real big show.

678
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,566
You see any escort?

679
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:29,818
Destroyers?

680
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,363
Nope, nothing.

681
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,657
No security. Nothing.

682
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:42,706
Strange.

683
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,336
Are they chasing one of ours
on the other side?

684
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,431
Damn moonlight.

685
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,896
- How many of ours are here?
- Five.

686
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:12,986
Shall we risk it?

687
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,408
I think so, captain.

688
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,247
Port to 180 degrees.

689
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:25,665
New course...

690
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,626
...port to 180 degrees.

691
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:37,218
How's it feel to you, Kriechbaum?

692
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,600
It will work, captain. For sure.

693
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,698
Tubes 1 to 4,
prepare for surface firing.

694
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,575
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

695
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,202
I'll take the helm.

696
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,412
Target optics to bridge.

697
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:28,895
All ahead full,
port to 107 degrees.

698
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:30,188
Commencing attack!

699
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,277
Watch the oil pressure!

700
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,784
Bow right, position 50.

701
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,410
Check.

702
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:46,955
Range: 2200.

703
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,667
Those two that overlap...

704
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,629
...double blast the fat one,
single shots for the other.

705
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:56,589
Tracking target.

706
01:33:56,756 --> 01:34:00,093
All ahead one-third.

707
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,095
Open torpedo hatches.

708
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:07,225
Tubes 1 and 2 coordinates:
Target bearing 63.

709
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,060
Sights adjusted.

710
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,062
Keep tracking target.

711
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,314
Target acquisition.

712
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,441
Tubes 1 and 2...

713
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,610
...fire at will.

714
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,740
Tube 1, fire!

715
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:26,411
Tube 2.

716
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,791
Tube 3, stand by.

717
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,630
Fire!

718
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:42,635
Tube 4 ready.

719
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,472
Fire!

720
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,766
Destroyer dead ahead!

721
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:51,978
They're firing!

722
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,939
Alarm!

723
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,850
Bow up 10, Stem up 5.

724
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,191
Quiet, damn it!

725
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,736
Down to 80 metres.

726
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,863
Slowly.

727
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:48,034
Bow down 15, Stem up 10.

728
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:53,957
What's with the torpedoes?

729
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,459
Wait and see.

730
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,425
The party is about to start.

731
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,054
Hundred ten.

732
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,772
Hundred twenty.

733
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,943
Shitty torpedoes.
Tracking is off again.

734
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,946
The old man crazy, or what?

735
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,864
Just charges right in.

736
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,200
Like some speedboat attack.

737
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:33,913
They'll rip our asses open now.

738
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:43,715
Got that one.

739
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,886
Yeah, boys, we got one!

740
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,306
Quiet now!

741
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,664
Time's up for third torpedo.

742
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:24,964
Number three.

743
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:42,940
Two going down.

744
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,917
Their bulkheads are breaking.
They're drowning.

745
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,645
Here it comes...

746
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,944
...their revenge.

747
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,415
Destroyer bearing 44 degrees.

748
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,833
Any movement?

749
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,751
Moving left...

750
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,920
...fading.

751
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:03,354
Right full rudder.
All ahead one-half.

752
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,864
Astern of us.

753
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,286
Way astern of us.

754
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,501
They're spitting at the wrong spot.

755
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:36,721
We aren't rid of them yet.

756
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:41,184
I guess they're a bit upset.

757
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,645
Destroyer contact.

758
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:48,065
Contact bearing 270 and closing.

759
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,736
All ahead one-third.

760
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,250
Here they come.

761
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:35,279
All ahead full!

762
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,906
Dump 150 litres!

763
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:45,715
Asdic.
[Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee]
Ancestor of active sonar.

764
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:49,103
Ultrasonic detection system.

765
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:58,362
Pigs. Rotten pigs.

766
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,876
Damages?

767
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:13,919
Air shaft fractured.

768
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:24,764
Quiet. Keep quiet.

769
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:17,650
Silent run.

770
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:20,986
Fifty r.p.m. Shut off ventilators.

771
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,948
Port 15.

772
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:45,845
All ahead full!

773
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,648
Shut it off!

774
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:17,168
Shut down auxiliary control panel!

775
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:55,372
Connect ventilation cartridges.

776
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,959
Start ventilators, connect cartridges.

777
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,615
They ain't kidding.

778
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,911
They really want to shake us up.

779
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:43,087
So that was all?

780
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,507
Calling it a day?

781
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,940
Boy, we really gave it to them...

782
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:09,113
...when those bulkheads broke
to pieces.

783
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:23,544
What's the bearing?

784
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:27,464
Steady at 65 degrees.

785
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,637
Deeper. Silent run.

786
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:02,041
New bearing?

787
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:06,378
Fifty degrees.

788
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,173
Growing louder.

789
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,862
Come on.

790
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:47,378
Still deeper.
Three degrees starboard.

791
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:49,713
Let's throw them...

792
01:47:52,925 --> 01:47:55,094
...for another little loop.

793
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:04,728
Bow steady. Stern up 10.

794
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,947
Contact bearing 270 degrees.

795
01:49:00,325 --> 01:49:02,161
Fading.

796
01:49:18,177 --> 01:49:19,970
Right full rudder.

797
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,307
Rudder is full right.

798
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,978
To 90 degrees.

799
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:50,000
Shit.

800
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,005
Second propeller sounds, 76 degrees.
Closing fast.

801
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:00,844
Reinforcements.

802
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,599
Those bastards.

803
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:38,423
Deeper.

804
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,639
Deeper still.

805
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,437
Bow down 10.

806
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:54,231
Stern up 7.

807
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,751
190 metres.

808
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,848
200 metres.

809
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:42,362
210 metres.

810
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,956
220 metres.

811
01:52:00,505 --> 01:52:02,549
230 metres.

812
01:52:14,311 --> 01:52:16,480
The bolts! They're bursting!

813
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:18,690
Keep the boat from dropping!
Up 10 metres!

814
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:21,235
All ahead one-half!

815
01:52:28,325 --> 01:52:31,245
Quiet, men, quiet.

816
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,579
Go to 150 metres! All ahead full!

817
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,881
Port 20!

818
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:26,550
Steer 50 degrees!

819
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,804
Pretty good shooting, mister.

820
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:13,263
Quiet, damn it!

821
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,974
I want proper damage reports!

822
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:28,278
Permission to check diesel?

823
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,615
Take over the helm!

824
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,127
Gaskets! Half-inch, hurry!

825
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:47,923
Where are you?

826
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,092
I need those gaskets!

827
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:52,844
Torpedo hatch taking water!

828
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:02,020
Tools! Hurry!

829
01:55:08,652 --> 01:55:11,571
The more they throw,
the sooner they run out.

830
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:30,799
Leakage above
exhaust vent repaired.

831
01:55:30,966 --> 01:55:34,261
150 metres, all ahead full.

832
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,197
What's the matter?

833
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:03,874
Return to your battle station.

834
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:05,167
At once!

835
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:20,265
Pull yourself together!

836
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:22,601
Back!

837
01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:29,316
Go back, Johann.

838
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,339
Take him aft, quickly!

839
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:56,593
He's gone, captain.

840
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:40,637
Why Johann, of all people?

841
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:46,226
Despicable.

842
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:50,355
Shameless.

843
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:12,669
Forget the headset.
We can hear it anyway.

844
01:58:37,986 --> 01:58:39,446
Come on, let's go.

845
01:59:05,388 --> 01:59:08,308
Boat dropping!

846
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:12,604
190 metres!

847
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:42,509
220 metres!

848
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:45,804
We're drowning!

849
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:59,836
Take this down for your log book.

850
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:06,176
After 6 hours of silent run...

851
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:09,179
...it seems certain...

852
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:13,099
...the enemy destroyers lost us.

853
02:01:15,769 --> 02:01:19,522
At 210 degrees...

854
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:22,317
...very heavy fire blazing.

855
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:25,653
Assume it to be the tanker we hit.

856
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:37,624
Surface in 10 minutes.

857
02:02:17,831 --> 02:02:19,749
See, lieutenant...

858
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:25,046
...they didn't kill us after all.

859
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,574
Her backbone is broken.

860
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:42,332
Damn tough ship, won't drown.

861
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,169
Let's get to it.

862
02:03:46,336 --> 02:03:48,087
Target optics to bridge.

863
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:50,632
Flood tube 1.

864
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,475
Enemy movement nil.

865
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:05,521
Range: 650 metres.

866
02:04:05,688 --> 02:04:09,108
Depth 4, torpedo speed 30.

867
02:04:09,817 --> 02:04:14,030
Target point,
directly before aft mast.

868
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:17,116
Tube 1 ready.

869
02:04:20,203 --> 02:04:21,454
Fire!

870
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,250
Men still on board!

871
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:21,597
Why weren't they rescued?

872
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:24,267
Damn it!

873
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:26,102
After all these hours!

874
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,631
They're swimming for us.

875
02:05:58,092 --> 02:05:59,552
All back one-half!

876
02:07:16,796 --> 02:07:18,381
Can I clear this?

877
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:53,833
Radiograms.

878
02:07:55,251 --> 02:07:56,752
Read them.

879
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:01,716
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoys dispersed."

880
02:08:02,049 --> 02:08:03,718
"Lost contact."

881
02:08:03,885 --> 02:08:06,554
"In pursuit at 30 degrees."

882
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:07,763
"From U-112."

883
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:10,892
That's Wenzel.

884
02:08:11,058 --> 02:08:12,435
Not bad.

885
02:08:13,269 --> 02:08:15,730
Kupsch pursuing same convoy.

886
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:20,067
Stackmann hit a 6000 tonner.

887
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:24,780
Quite a battlefield.

888
02:08:26,782 --> 02:08:28,117
Can we get there?

889
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:32,580
Difficult.

890
02:08:32,747 --> 02:08:34,457
At least 5 hours away.

891
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:36,626
Our fuel--

892
02:08:36,792 --> 02:08:39,378
- We couldn't do 5--
- All right, already!

893
02:09:04,904 --> 02:09:06,280
When do we turn back?

894
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:16,791
When I give the order...

895
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:19,460
...navigator.

896
02:09:51,867 --> 02:09:54,996
Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast.

897
02:09:55,162 --> 02:09:58,332
Crew, assumed rescued,
was still on board.

898
02:09:58,499 --> 02:10:01,252
Survivors swam toward U-96.

899
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:44,670
I want to apologise.

900
02:10:45,755 --> 02:10:47,882
You can't just apologise.

901
02:10:49,759 --> 02:10:53,763
You left your battle station
at a critical time.

902
02:10:54,764 --> 02:10:56,932
Also, you disobeyed my order.

903
02:11:09,403 --> 02:11:11,947
Will I be court-martialled?

904
02:11:20,247 --> 02:11:21,957
How many war patrols for you?

905
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,585
It's my ninth.

906
02:11:30,925 --> 02:11:33,552
You, of all people, Johann.

907
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:39,058
It's never happened before.

908
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:53,948
My nerves cracked somehow.

909
02:11:58,452 --> 02:12:02,581
It won't happen again.
You can count on me.

910
02:12:05,584 --> 02:12:07,503
I swear.

911
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:12,341
All right, Johann.

912
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:17,096
No court martial?

913
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:25,688
Go on to bed.

914
02:12:39,452 --> 02:12:41,996
U-96 withdrew from survivors.

915
02:12:42,163 --> 02:12:45,207
Decision: return to base 0700.

916
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:04,977
Second officer!

917
02:13:11,525 --> 02:13:13,152
You'll fix it.

918
02:13:13,986 --> 02:13:15,905
It's the bulkhead conduit.

919
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:17,907
It'll work.

920
02:13:20,743 --> 02:13:22,369
Morning.

921
02:13:23,913 --> 02:13:26,540
Get moving, signal to decode.

922
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:37,760
More top secrets.

923
02:13:39,094 --> 02:13:41,430
Another special goose chase.

924
02:13:42,056 --> 02:13:43,891
Not us.

925
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:46,268
We're ready for the wharf.

926
02:13:46,435 --> 02:13:50,022
And the fuel...
We won't even make La Rochelle.

927
02:13:50,606 --> 02:13:53,442
- The last 100 miles-
- We'll set sail.

928
02:13:54,068 --> 02:13:55,945
We'll be all right, chief.

929
02:13:58,531 --> 02:14:00,199
How's it coming?

930
02:14:03,953 --> 02:14:05,579
What you got?

931
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:09,542
"For captain's eyes only."

932
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,318
That's a first.

933
02:14:36,944 --> 02:14:38,988
Triple coded.

934
02:14:46,829 --> 02:14:49,582
Yeah.
Christmas in La Rochelle.

935
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,292
Gonna get laid again.

936
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,252
All of those sexy nurses...

937
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:57,339
...hot telephone operators,
all those warm bodies.

938
02:14:57,506 --> 02:14:59,008
Screwing like mad.

939
02:14:59,174 --> 02:15:03,679
A nice, slow afternoon fuck.

940
02:15:04,179 --> 02:15:06,515
- Attention.
- Our master's voice.

941
02:15:07,182 --> 02:15:08,267
La Rochelle's out.

942
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:12,938
We've been ordered to a new port.

943
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:14,231
La Spezia...

944
02:15:16,025 --> 02:15:18,360
...in the Mediterranean.

945
02:15:19,028 --> 02:15:22,197
Fuel and provisions out of Vigo first.

946
02:15:22,698 --> 02:15:24,491
That's in Spain.

947
02:15:24,825 --> 02:15:26,201
That is all.

948
02:15:30,706 --> 02:15:32,833
Those bastards stuck it to us.

949
02:15:34,043 --> 02:15:35,127
Shit.

950
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:38,297
No getting laid.

951
02:15:38,714 --> 02:15:42,051
No sexy nurses.
No hot telephone operators.

952
02:15:42,217 --> 02:15:44,345
Horse shit!

953
02:15:46,221 --> 02:15:48,557
Christmas with the Macaronis.

954
02:15:48,724 --> 02:15:51,393
Got to get there first, stupid!

955
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,062
What do you mean?

956
02:15:54,063 --> 02:15:55,981
Gibraltar!

957
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:59,485
Stick a finger up your ass
to get the idea.

958
02:16:04,073 --> 02:16:06,325
It's as tight as a virgin.

959
02:16:07,326 --> 02:16:10,913
We'll need Vaseline to get through.

960
02:16:27,346 --> 02:16:28,764
The Mediterranean.

961
02:16:29,515 --> 02:16:31,433
They're nuts.

962
02:16:32,101 --> 02:16:34,895
It's swarming
with English combat ships.

963
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,939
Stand by for calculations!

964
02:16:37,856 --> 02:16:39,191
Zero...

965
02:16:39,775 --> 02:16:42,945
...25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

966
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:46,073
Gibraltar.

967
02:16:46,949 --> 02:16:49,743
Excellent prospects for drowning.

968
02:17:04,758 --> 02:17:08,637
You and the chief will go ashore
in Vigo.

969
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:10,973
How's that?

970
02:17:11,473 --> 02:17:13,892
I'll radio it in a minute.

971
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:21,150
I'll have to find a replacement
for the chief.

972
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:28,073
They'll smuggle you
through Spain somehow...

973
02:17:29,616 --> 02:17:32,286
...even if you have
to dress like gypsies.

974
02:17:33,454 --> 02:17:36,165
- But I was on for the whole--
- No heroics.

975
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:41,587
It's already settled.

976
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:45,007
One guy alone would be tough.

977
02:17:49,178 --> 02:17:52,139
We've got agents to get you through.

978
02:18:05,277 --> 02:18:07,613
Chief's wife is very ill.

979
02:18:10,991 --> 02:18:13,035
He's got to go ashore.

980
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,209
Aye, aye, sir.

981
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:37,392
Pretty bad, huh?

982
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:52,574
I'm going ashore at Vigo...

983
02:18:54,326 --> 02:18:56,495
...with the chief.

984
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:00,374
Captain's orders.

985
02:19:07,756 --> 02:19:10,592
Want me to take your letters?

986
02:19:27,734 --> 02:19:29,945
But it's a big pile.

987
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:36,618
Well, it's a big love, right?

988
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:20,162
Equalize pressure.

989
02:20:27,461 --> 02:20:28,754
All quiet.

990
02:20:29,796 --> 02:20:30,964
White light.

991
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:32,925
Watch where you stomp.

992
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:35,344
Quiet, man!

993
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:46,313
We've got to find the right tub here.

994
02:20:48,982 --> 02:20:50,859
The "Weser"...

995
02:20:52,778 --> 02:20:55,781
...a German merchant vessel,
is interned here.

996
02:20:56,823 --> 02:21:01,161
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and provisions.

997
02:21:01,536 --> 02:21:03,872
Just for us.

998
02:21:04,539 --> 02:21:07,542
Yeah, 1st class service.

999
02:21:20,347 --> 02:21:22,557
Starboard engine stop.

1000
02:21:24,685 --> 02:21:26,395
We've arrived.

1001
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:28,355
Port engine stop.

1002
02:21:37,406 --> 02:21:38,907
Officers to bridge.

1003
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:42,327
Watch out on deck.

1004
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:56,008
Gentlemen.

1005
02:22:02,848 --> 02:22:05,684
We welcome our heroic
German U-boat crew.

1006
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:20,449
A wholehearted welcome...

1007
02:22:20,782 --> 02:22:22,409
...captain.

1008
02:22:22,617 --> 02:22:26,455
No, please, not me.

1009
02:22:27,706 --> 02:22:29,541
This is the captain.

1010
02:22:29,875 --> 02:22:31,918
My apologies.

1011
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:38,133
Welcome aboard the "Weser,"
captain.

1012
02:22:38,967 --> 02:22:43,638
A real hero, in person.
I am most delighted.

1013
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:46,308
Well, gentlemen...

1014
02:22:46,475 --> 02:22:48,769
...here they are...

1015
02:22:48,935 --> 02:22:51,396
...heroes of the deep.

1016
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:53,774
The famous grey wolves...

1017
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:57,319
...with us,
inside our modest cabin...

1018
02:22:57,652 --> 02:22:59,780
...so to speak.

1019
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,574
Captain, allow me.

1020
02:23:02,741 --> 02:23:04,242
A warm welcome.

1021
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:06,495
Nice tugboat you've got here.

1022
02:23:10,957 --> 02:23:12,793
We're well prepared...

1023
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:16,296
...in all modesty, of course,
but not bad at all.

1024
02:23:16,463 --> 02:23:19,841
Like a taste of home,
so to speak.

1025
02:23:20,842 --> 02:23:23,970
Fresh bread,
cakes from our own bakery...

1026
02:23:24,137 --> 02:23:28,517
...bacon, fresh sausages,
stuffed just today, naturally.

1027
02:23:30,143 --> 02:23:32,771
You've got to tell us your news.

1028
02:23:32,938 --> 02:23:35,857
You can't imagine our curiosity.

1029
02:23:37,192 --> 02:23:40,654
It's not an easy life here,
appearances to the contrary.

1030
02:23:40,821 --> 02:23:44,699
There's plenty of fuel and food
to eat...

1031
02:23:44,866 --> 02:23:47,869
...but torpedoes are difficult
to come by.

1032
02:23:49,287 --> 02:23:51,498
But we always have our ways.

1033
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:57,129
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but there's no love lost between us.

1034
02:23:57,295 --> 02:23:59,506
Christmas bread.

1035
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,343
So, tell me...

1036
02:24:03,552 --> 02:24:05,554
...how many ships have you sunk?

1037
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:08,140
Let me guess--

1038
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:09,850
The champagne.

1039
02:24:10,016 --> 02:24:12,018
How forgetful of me.

1040
02:24:12,185 --> 02:24:13,520
Please.

1041
02:24:14,229 --> 02:24:15,814
Gentlemen.

1042
02:24:18,358 --> 02:24:20,569
We drink to your health.

1043
02:24:20,735 --> 02:24:22,737
We are so proud of you.

1044
02:24:24,072 --> 02:24:26,241
We toast the German U-boats...

1045
02:24:26,408 --> 02:24:28,660
...and our beloved Füh...

1046
02:24:30,078 --> 02:24:32,664
I forget we're not at home here...

1047
02:24:32,831 --> 02:24:34,708
...if you know what I mean.

1048
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:37,169
Cheers.

1049
02:24:38,003 --> 02:24:39,921
To your health.

1050
02:24:42,048 --> 02:24:44,885
Come on, dig in.

1051
02:24:45,844 --> 02:24:47,888
Let's dive into this stuff.

1052
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:55,604
Come, captain, tell us all.

1053
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:58,190
We're so very curious.

1054
02:24:59,441 --> 02:25:01,568
Those are fresh figs.

1055
02:25:09,868 --> 02:25:11,620
Never had one before.

1056
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:21,463
Quiet, gentlemen.

1057
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,969
They almost had us this time.

1058
02:25:33,141 --> 02:25:34,601
Phenomenal.

1059
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:39,481
You see,
that's the language of a hero.

1060
02:25:39,648 --> 02:25:42,484
To-the-point. Simply phenomenal.

1061
02:25:43,109 --> 02:25:45,654
But you can't get away that easily.

1062
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:48,990
Hand me that. Herring salad.

1063
02:25:49,407 --> 02:25:51,326
Our cook's speciality.

1064
02:25:51,493 --> 02:25:53,662
You must try it.

1065
02:25:54,663 --> 02:25:57,165
Come on now, taste it.

1066
02:26:02,254 --> 02:26:04,839
How's it feel beneath the surface...

1067
02:26:05,006 --> 02:26:06,925
...submerged...

1068
02:26:07,592 --> 02:26:10,011
...while the enemy lurks above?

1069
02:26:10,637 --> 02:26:12,097
Dark.

1070
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,768
And real quiet.

1071
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:19,354
As long as nobody farts.

1072
02:26:21,856 --> 02:26:22,983
Pardon me?

1073
02:26:23,358 --> 02:26:26,987
- As long as--
- He means, on silent runs...

1074
02:26:27,153 --> 02:26:30,490
...the crew must show
extreme discipline.

1075
02:26:30,657 --> 02:26:33,535
And that's why nobody can fart.

1076
02:26:36,663 --> 02:26:39,874
Herr Seewald,
we've been expecting you.

1077
02:26:43,712 --> 02:26:45,964
The delegate of the naval attache.

1078
02:26:48,216 --> 02:26:50,802
I have messages from headquarters.

1079
02:26:53,221 --> 02:26:55,974
But first,
your orders for Gibraltar.

1080
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,355
And this radiogram.

1081
02:27:13,408 --> 02:27:16,036
Chief, Lieutenant Werner.

1082
02:27:20,248 --> 02:27:22,250
We're taking a stroll.

1083
02:27:31,551 --> 02:27:33,178
What's going on?

1084
02:27:33,553 --> 02:27:35,096
Bad news.

1085
02:27:41,728 --> 02:27:44,439
Request was denied
by headquarters.

1086
02:27:50,403 --> 02:27:53,990
You've got to stay on board.
You too, lieutenant.

1087
02:28:01,623 --> 02:28:03,291
I'm sorry.

1088
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,422
It's probably just as well.

1089
02:28:12,467 --> 02:28:15,303
Who knows who they'd
replace me with?

1090
02:28:19,265 --> 02:28:23,478
Might be one of those
wet-behind-the-ears kids.

1091
02:28:28,817 --> 02:28:30,777
Very well could be.

1092
02:28:32,404 --> 02:28:36,324
They should've put some pussy
in storage for screwing.

1093
02:28:36,491 --> 02:28:40,578
Yeah, you'd be fighting
Spanish crabs by now.

1094
02:28:40,912 --> 02:28:42,997
Better than blue balls!

1095
02:28:43,164 --> 02:28:46,334
Move it and clear the chart table.

1096
02:28:46,501 --> 02:28:48,628
I can't navigate on bananas.

1097
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:52,006
Are you nuts? Move that fruit.

1098
02:28:52,173 --> 02:28:54,509
The depth controls are blocked.

1099
02:28:56,177 --> 02:28:57,512
That's a Christmas tree?

1100
02:28:57,679 --> 02:29:00,181
It ain't camouflage for the bridge.

1101
02:29:05,103 --> 02:29:06,855
We're staying on board.

1102
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:08,982
Orders from headquarters.

1103
02:29:20,368 --> 02:29:22,287
Sorry, Ullman.

1104
02:29:39,637 --> 02:29:42,682
Seven miles between coasts.

1105
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:45,351
A tight squeeze, I'd say.

1106
02:29:47,687 --> 02:29:49,898
These are the British docks.

1107
02:29:50,732 --> 02:29:54,903
Their only port for repairs
in the western Mediterranean.

1108
02:29:56,696 --> 02:29:59,365
It will be well protected.

1109
02:30:03,077 --> 02:30:05,246
All kinds of defences.

1110
02:30:08,374 --> 02:30:11,586
Anything floating will be
on the water.

1111
02:30:15,131 --> 02:30:17,425
We'll have to manoeuver through it.

1112
02:30:18,676 --> 02:30:20,845
That's the situation.

1113
02:30:33,525 --> 02:30:35,777
We'll move under cover
of darkness...

1114
02:30:37,195 --> 02:30:39,072
...skimming the surface.

1115
02:30:43,535 --> 02:30:46,287
We'll cut right
through the English ships.

1116
02:30:51,251 --> 02:30:54,754
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar
as we can get.

1117
02:31:04,514 --> 02:31:06,516
Then we'll dive...

1118
02:31:08,226 --> 02:31:10,228
...and let ourselves drop.

1119
02:31:20,822 --> 02:31:22,323
Dive...

1120
02:31:24,576 --> 02:31:27,870
...then float with the current
through the strait.

1121
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:36,379
No racket.

1122
02:31:38,673 --> 02:31:40,049
It saves fuel.

1123
02:31:49,017 --> 02:31:50,518
So, Kriechbaum?

1124
02:31:57,317 --> 02:31:59,694
Not bad, captain.

1125
02:32:26,888 --> 02:32:28,389
Let's go.

1126
02:32:33,019 --> 02:32:35,688
All ahead one-half.

1127
02:32:39,609 --> 02:32:43,029
Navigator and I stay,
everyone else clear the bridge.

1128
02:33:15,978 --> 02:33:18,606
Half the English fleet is here.

1129
02:33:20,483 --> 02:33:23,903
Two degrees to port.
Switch to electric motor.

1130
02:33:59,731 --> 02:34:01,566
Destroyer across port.

1131
02:34:01,733 --> 02:34:04,152
Range: 800, running parallel.

1132
02:34:04,861 --> 02:34:06,279
What's he doing?

1133
02:34:06,988 --> 02:34:08,030
Closing in?

1134
02:34:14,871 --> 02:34:16,497
No, moving ahead.

1135
02:34:17,665 --> 02:34:19,167
Very good.

1136
02:34:25,006 --> 02:34:26,841
Left full rudder.

1137
02:34:28,176 --> 02:34:30,970
All ahead full.

1138
02:34:33,639 --> 02:34:35,224
All right, then.

1139
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:29,862
Right full rudder! All ahead full.

1140
02:35:32,657 --> 02:35:33,825
Damn!

1141
02:36:00,601 --> 02:36:02,311
Gibraltar.

1142
02:36:15,074 --> 02:36:17,743
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

1143
02:36:34,302 --> 02:36:35,803
Alarm!

1144
02:36:36,012 --> 02:36:37,221
Flood tanks!

1145
02:36:42,768 --> 02:36:44,312
Watch out, don't dive!

1146
02:36:44,478 --> 02:36:47,732
- Captain's still on bridge!
- Kriechbaum's wounded!

1147
02:36:49,609 --> 02:36:52,194
Both diesels ahead full!

1148
02:36:52,403 --> 02:36:54,864
Blow all tanks!

1149
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:56,991
Prepare to abandon ship!

1150
02:36:59,243 --> 02:37:02,496
Medic to officers' mess immediately!

1151
02:37:06,709 --> 02:37:09,420
Where's the medic?

1152
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:12,548
Maximum power!
Right full rudder!

1153
02:37:15,301 --> 02:37:16,886
All men into rescue gear!

1154
02:37:17,053 --> 02:37:18,638
Prepare to abandon!

1155
02:37:18,804 --> 02:37:20,389
Hold this!

1156
02:37:27,396 --> 02:37:31,317
Faster, faster!

1157
02:37:41,285 --> 02:37:43,496
Get a compress!

1158
02:37:55,341 --> 02:37:58,636
Gotta shut down port diesel.
It's pulled loose.

1159
02:37:58,803 --> 02:38:00,429
Keep full speed!

1160
02:38:00,638 --> 02:38:04,183
Give it everything she's got!

1161
02:38:04,934 --> 02:38:06,519
What's he going to do?

1162
02:38:06,686 --> 02:38:07,728
Southern course...

1163
02:38:07,895 --> 02:38:10,272
...moving toward the African coast.

1164
02:38:18,990 --> 02:38:21,492
Damn.

1165
02:38:25,454 --> 02:38:27,415
Flood tanks!

1166
02:38:27,581 --> 02:38:29,750
All men to bow!

1167
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:41,554
Down to 90 metres.

1168
02:38:46,392 --> 02:38:49,437
- Bow plane jammed!
- Use manual rudder!

1169
02:38:51,731 --> 02:38:54,859
Bow plane stuck
in full down position!

1170
02:39:03,534 --> 02:39:04,910
Both engines stop.

1171
02:39:05,286 --> 02:39:07,371
All men aft!

1172
02:39:14,086 --> 02:39:15,671
Hurry! Faster!

1173
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:17,173
Trim all to stem!

1174
02:39:18,632 --> 02:39:20,134
Ballast pump down!

1175
02:39:20,301 --> 02:39:21,302
Trim with air!

1176
02:39:24,972 --> 02:39:26,140
Still sinking.

1177
02:39:26,307 --> 02:39:28,059
Load unchanged.

1178
02:39:28,225 --> 02:39:30,436
Gotta lose weight!

1179
02:39:30,603 --> 02:39:32,813
Pump 1000 litres!

1180
02:39:35,608 --> 02:39:37,443
Shut him up, medic!

1181
02:39:39,361 --> 02:39:40,863
Main pump down!

1182
02:39:42,156 --> 02:39:43,783
Blow tanks?

1183
02:39:44,116 --> 02:39:45,534
All back full!

1184
02:39:52,291 --> 02:39:53,834
Boat not responding.

1185
02:39:54,043 --> 02:39:57,004
Blow tanks. Blow tanks!

1186
02:39:57,171 --> 02:39:58,214
Blow front.

1187
02:40:02,718 --> 02:40:04,720
Stop now.

1188
02:40:07,223 --> 02:40:09,725
Why don't you stop!

1189
02:40:11,477 --> 02:40:13,938
Give it whatever she's got, chief!

1190
02:40:14,105 --> 02:40:15,106
Blow them all!

1191
02:40:17,108 --> 02:40:18,484
Come on up.

1192
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:48,013
Boat is beyond control.

1193
02:40:53,227 --> 02:40:54,228
200.

1194
02:40:58,482 --> 02:40:59,567
210.

1195
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:06,240
220 metres.

1196
02:41:08,784 --> 02:41:10,703
Beyond 230.

1197
02:41:11,829 --> 02:41:13,497
240 metres.

1198
02:41:16,250 --> 02:41:18,377
250 metres.

1199
02:41:23,591 --> 02:41:25,217
My God.

1200
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:29,180
Do not turn...

1201
02:41:29,638 --> 02:41:31,891
...Thy face away from me.

1202
02:42:22,942 --> 02:42:24,610
A shovelful of sand.

1203
02:42:27,988 --> 02:42:31,909
God threw a shovelful
of sand beneath our keel.

1204
02:42:43,963 --> 02:42:45,464
280 metres.

1205
02:42:47,049 --> 02:42:49,218
This boat's amazing.

1206
02:43:39,685 --> 02:43:41,645
Torpedo hatch taking water!

1207
02:43:44,898 --> 02:43:47,151
Taking water behind control panel!

1208
02:43:49,194 --> 02:43:52,281
Taking water in motor bilge!

1209
02:43:53,282 --> 02:43:55,451
Tube 5 taking water!

1210
02:43:59,538 --> 02:44:00,789
What you need?

1211
02:44:00,956 --> 02:44:03,917
- Leakage plugs.
- In the bow.

1212
02:44:06,128 --> 02:44:07,254
Exhaust valve?

1213
02:44:07,921 --> 02:44:10,132
Leakage plugs! Move!

1214
02:44:13,844 --> 02:44:15,763
Give me that lamp!

1215
02:44:16,472 --> 02:44:18,140
I need a wrench, damn it!

1216
02:44:18,307 --> 02:44:20,017
Where are my reports?

1217
02:44:20,851 --> 02:44:23,062
Taking water at tower frame!

1218
02:44:23,228 --> 02:44:25,230
Where are the tools?

1219
02:44:30,819 --> 02:44:33,530
- Where is it?
- Bilge pump!

1220
02:44:34,365 --> 02:44:36,116
Motor control panels down!

1221
02:44:36,283 --> 02:44:37,701
Diesel's all busted!

1222
02:44:37,868 --> 02:44:39,620
I demand proper reports!

1223
02:44:46,168 --> 02:44:47,503
Where's it worst?

1224
02:44:47,669 --> 02:44:50,756
Shaft valves and housing.

1225
02:44:51,382 --> 02:44:53,967
Machinist, battery two...

1226
02:44:54,134 --> 02:44:56,136
...determine damages.

1227
02:44:58,639 --> 02:45:01,100
Don't strip the crankshafts.

1228
02:45:01,266 --> 02:45:02,476
Can't see a thing!

1229
02:45:02,684 --> 02:45:05,562
Push harder!

1230
02:45:05,729 --> 02:45:06,980
I'm pushing!

1231
02:45:07,773 --> 02:45:10,275
Can't get the wedge in!

1232
02:45:10,442 --> 02:45:12,152
Give me that hammer!

1233
02:45:18,659 --> 02:45:21,161
Need more men aft?

1234
02:45:21,328 --> 02:45:23,539
I'll find out!

1235
02:45:25,582 --> 02:45:27,042
- Damn it.
- Can I help?

1236
02:45:27,209 --> 02:45:28,877
Hold the light!

1237
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:32,923
Father, don't forsake us.

1238
02:45:34,174 --> 02:45:35,968
Stupid asshole!

1239
02:45:37,094 --> 02:45:38,137
Damn idiot.

1240
02:45:39,596 --> 02:45:41,682
I need the diesel room toolbox.

1241
02:45:41,890 --> 02:45:43,642
Hurry!

1242
02:45:44,268 --> 02:45:45,936
Where are the tools?

1243
02:45:49,356 --> 02:45:50,566
Bigger wrench!

1244
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:53,110
Leakage in diesel bilge!

1245
02:46:02,119 --> 02:46:05,456
Tighten them carefully.
Don't break the bolts.

1246
02:46:07,332 --> 02:46:08,542
Cooling pipe leaking!

1247
02:46:11,753 --> 02:46:15,090
Get down there
and tighten those valves!

1248
02:46:17,759 --> 02:46:20,179
Give me that timber!

1249
02:46:25,309 --> 02:46:28,187
More plugs...hurry!

1250
02:46:40,782 --> 02:46:42,701
Gently, men.

1251
02:46:54,379 --> 02:46:56,298
Taking water fast in stem.

1252
02:46:56,465 --> 02:47:00,802
All hull valves burst.
Cooling system down.

1253
02:47:00,969 --> 02:47:05,599
Compressors dislodged.
Shaft valves taking water.

1254
02:47:07,601 --> 02:47:09,853
What about fuel leaks?

1255
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:11,104
Can't tell yet.

1256
02:47:11,271 --> 02:47:14,358
- Anything else?
- Battery cells are cracked.

1257
02:47:14,525 --> 02:47:16,527
They can't take this.

1258
02:47:22,616 --> 02:47:24,034
Acid in the bilge.

1259
02:47:24,201 --> 02:47:27,996
Neutralise with lime wash.
Count drained cells.

1260
02:47:28,163 --> 02:47:31,333
Get battery connectors, hurry!

1261
02:47:49,643 --> 02:47:50,644
Over here!

1262
02:47:50,811 --> 02:47:53,313
I need plugs and a hammer!

1263
02:47:58,110 --> 02:48:00,988
- Here it is.
- Thanks, lieutenant.

1264
02:48:13,917 --> 02:48:15,836
Calm down.

1265
02:48:23,802 --> 02:48:25,053
Tell the chief.

1266
02:48:25,220 --> 02:48:29,641
Taking water in motor room.
Rising above torpedo tubes.

1267
02:48:38,984 --> 02:48:40,402
Careful.

1268
02:48:47,117 --> 02:48:48,785
Twenty-four cells drained.

1269
02:48:48,952 --> 02:48:51,872
Twenty-four cells. Holy shit.

1270
02:49:01,381 --> 02:49:03,592
We're way short of connectors.

1271
02:49:07,721 --> 02:49:11,433
He's got to bridge
those damaged cells.

1272
02:49:11,725 --> 02:49:13,185
Or else we've had it.

1273
02:49:15,979 --> 02:49:18,315
Can't tighten it. Can't see.

1274
02:49:18,482 --> 02:49:20,400
Lieutenant, lights!

1275
02:49:21,693 --> 02:49:24,321
If we don't fix this, we're goners!

1276
02:49:33,664 --> 02:49:36,291
To the right, more to the right.

1277
02:49:43,882 --> 02:49:45,175
Wire.

1278
02:49:45,676 --> 02:49:47,594
I need wire for bridging.

1279
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:51,765
Move it, we need wire.
Hurry up.

1280
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:02,192
The chief needs wire.
Look for wire.

1281
02:50:02,442 --> 02:50:04,319
Move it. Search for wire.

1282
02:50:04,528 --> 02:50:07,030
Incredible torpedoes in these tubes.

1283
02:50:07,989 --> 02:50:10,492
Twenty-five thousand Marks apiece.

1284
02:50:10,659 --> 02:50:12,369
And we can't find...

1285
02:50:12,536 --> 02:50:14,121
...a piece of wire.

1286
02:50:14,287 --> 02:50:17,165
Some old wire worth 50 pennies.

1287
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:21,670
Periscope hydraulics jammed.

1288
02:50:21,837 --> 02:50:24,005
Can't be moved manually, either.

1289
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:28,510
Wire.

1290
02:50:29,469 --> 02:50:31,346
Finally, something.

1291
02:50:31,513 --> 02:50:32,889
Pliers!

1292
02:50:46,403 --> 02:50:47,696
Leaks stopped.

1293
02:50:53,618 --> 02:50:54,661
Good, Johann.

1294
02:50:59,332 --> 02:51:00,917
Really good.

1295
02:51:06,339 --> 02:51:08,925
Now, get out of those wet rags.

1296
02:51:19,811 --> 02:51:21,897
Now let's get it out.

1297
02:51:22,063 --> 02:51:24,191
This water's got to go.

1298
02:51:25,442 --> 02:51:27,694
First, into the control room bilge...

1299
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:29,780
...and then out.

1300
02:51:36,369 --> 02:51:38,830
Faster. Let's get rid of it.

1301
02:51:47,589 --> 02:51:50,383
And scoop. And scoop.

1302
02:51:57,808 --> 02:52:01,144
Get with it.
No falling asleep back there.

1303
02:52:07,776 --> 02:52:09,903
Three more cells starboard.

1304
02:52:22,415 --> 02:52:24,000
Where do we stand?

1305
02:52:24,584 --> 02:52:27,504
Almost done. Three cells to go.

1306
02:52:40,016 --> 02:52:42,894
Make way for the chief.

1307
02:53:09,754 --> 02:53:12,382
Entire compass system is down...

1308
02:53:14,134 --> 02:53:17,095
...probably the sonar too.

1309
02:53:17,262 --> 02:53:18,847
Radio is totally out.

1310
02:53:21,641 --> 02:53:23,393
Quite a mess.

1311
02:53:26,104 --> 02:53:27,647
Can we surface?

1312
02:53:33,612 --> 02:53:35,030
Any chance at all?

1313
02:53:42,037 --> 02:53:44,247
Good question.

1314
02:53:49,878 --> 02:53:52,839
Some air may be left
in the ballast tanks...

1315
02:53:53,673 --> 02:53:55,467
...from all that blowing.

1316
02:53:57,886 --> 02:54:00,096
That might help us.

1317
02:54:00,347 --> 02:54:03,099
With every last bit of air pressure...

1318
02:54:08,396 --> 02:54:09,856
...maybe-—

1319
02:54:14,152 --> 02:54:16,738
We've got to reduce our weight.

1320
02:54:18,281 --> 02:54:20,617
That water has to get out.

1321
02:54:27,624 --> 02:54:29,709
Might work. It just might!

1322
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,297
Aft is almost bailed.

1323
02:54:41,805 --> 02:54:43,139
It could work...

1324
02:54:43,306 --> 02:54:45,183
...by hand into tanks...

1325
02:54:45,350 --> 02:54:46,601
...then with main pump...

1326
02:54:46,768 --> 02:54:49,604
...and air pressure,
the water's pushed out.

1327
02:54:49,771 --> 02:54:51,564
Main pump?

1328
02:54:52,273 --> 02:54:53,900
Can do.

1329
02:54:57,862 --> 02:55:00,073
Then we go for broke.

1330
02:55:01,574 --> 02:55:03,159
Blow tanks, and-—

1331
02:55:04,786 --> 02:55:06,663
We'll get only one try.

1332
02:55:08,873 --> 02:55:10,000
When?

1333
02:55:10,166 --> 02:55:12,335
Once everything's repaired.

1334
02:55:12,502 --> 02:55:14,295
In 6 to 8 hours.

1335
02:55:16,423 --> 02:55:19,384
- CO2 content?
- 1.8 percent.

1336
02:55:20,468 --> 02:55:22,220
We got enough oxygen?

1337
02:55:22,887 --> 02:55:24,222
No.

1338
02:55:27,142 --> 02:55:29,853
Pass out oxygen masks as needed...

1339
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:31,980
...men off duty to their bunks.

1340
02:56:44,469 --> 02:56:45,845
How's he doing?

1341
02:56:46,012 --> 02:56:47,806
Hard to tell.

1342
02:57:06,658 --> 02:57:08,535
Doesn't look good.

1343
02:57:48,199 --> 02:57:49,784
So, Pilgrim...

1344
02:57:51,286 --> 02:57:52,579
...all okay?

1345
02:57:52,745 --> 02:57:54,914
Yes, captain.

1346
02:57:55,081 --> 02:57:57,167
It's all okay.

1347
02:58:00,461 --> 02:58:02,714
How are things aft?

1348
02:58:03,298 --> 02:58:05,592
Moving along, captain.

1349
02:58:07,844 --> 02:58:10,388
Guess I'll show my face then, huh?

1350
02:58:43,796 --> 02:58:45,423
Be careful.

1351
02:59:08,238 --> 02:59:10,031
All right here?

1352
02:59:10,198 --> 02:59:12,575
Okay. Doing fine.

1353
02:59:17,914 --> 02:59:21,668
Sure, captain. It'll work out.

1354
02:59:29,425 --> 02:59:31,219
How's it going?

1355
02:59:33,054 --> 02:59:36,266
Got to change two more bearings.

1356
03:00:42,165 --> 03:00:43,750
Do you want some glucose?

1357
03:01:24,957 --> 03:01:26,501
Crazy idea...

1358
03:01:27,627 --> 03:01:30,004
...to ram us through this strait.

1359
03:01:31,464 --> 03:01:33,633
It was bound to go wrong.

1360
03:01:38,888 --> 03:01:40,890
He knew it.

1361
03:01:42,558 --> 03:01:45,395
That old fox knew it all along.

1362
03:01:50,483 --> 03:01:54,320
Since he got that radiogram...

1363
03:01:54,904 --> 03:01:57,657
...ordering us to break through.

1364
03:02:00,201 --> 03:02:04,163
That's why
he wanted us off the boat...

1365
03:02:04,330 --> 03:02:06,040
...in Vigo.

1366
03:02:11,003 --> 03:02:14,048
There was no chance to get through.

1367
03:02:29,772 --> 03:02:33,860
He wanted to make us believe
it was possible...

1368
03:02:34,527 --> 03:02:36,237
...with a simple trick.

1369
03:02:40,783 --> 03:02:44,620
"Drop down and glide through"--

1370
03:02:49,417 --> 03:02:52,128
Not a bad trick...

1371
03:02:54,422 --> 03:02:56,924
...except that it had to work.

1372
03:03:03,931 --> 03:03:07,727
Will we ever surface, chief?

1373
03:03:16,402 --> 03:03:17,904
I don't know.

1374
03:04:07,870 --> 03:04:09,539
I'm sorry.

1375
03:04:11,707 --> 03:04:13,793
Is it hopeless?

1376
03:04:17,547 --> 03:04:20,341
It's been 15 hours.

1377
03:04:28,474 --> 03:04:30,309
He's not going to pull it off.

1378
03:04:52,915 --> 03:04:54,542
I'm sorry.

1379
03:05:03,342 --> 03:05:05,761
I asked for it.

1380
03:05:11,684 --> 03:05:15,438
"To be heading into the inexorable..."

1381
03:05:17,189 --> 03:05:21,611
"...where no mother will care for us..."

1382
03:05:22,903 --> 03:05:26,532
"...no woman crosses our path..."

1383
03:05:28,034 --> 03:05:32,455
"...where only reality reigns,
with cruelty and grandeur."

1384
03:05:43,799 --> 03:05:46,302
I was drunk with those words.

1385
03:05:53,225 --> 03:05:56,062
Well, this is reality.

1386
03:06:47,113 --> 03:06:49,323
Reporting to the captain.

1387
03:06:54,161 --> 03:06:55,996
Electric motor fixed.

1388
03:06:57,289 --> 03:06:59,625
Main pump fixed.

1389
03:07:00,042 --> 03:07:02,211
Water can be pumped into tanks...

1390
03:07:04,380 --> 03:07:07,466
...then blown out
with compressed air.

1391
03:07:08,551 --> 03:07:10,553
Compass ready.

1392
03:07:11,637 --> 03:07:13,514
Sonar ready.

1393
03:07:29,822 --> 03:07:31,824
Good, chief.

1394
03:07:47,423 --> 03:07:49,425
Take a rest now.

1395
03:07:58,017 --> 03:08:00,394
Still got a few small problems.

1396
03:08:46,232 --> 03:08:48,818
All you need is good people.

1397
03:08:52,947 --> 03:08:54,740
Good people.

1398
03:08:59,119 --> 03:09:00,663
Listen up.

1399
03:09:04,166 --> 03:09:06,335
We're going to blow tanks now...

1400
03:09:06,919 --> 03:09:09,588
...to see if we can lift our butt.

1401
03:09:13,008 --> 03:09:14,260
If we do...

1402
03:09:15,177 --> 03:09:17,429
...it might get uncomfortable again.

1403
03:09:19,598 --> 03:09:21,600
Lots of traffic up there.

1404
03:09:26,939 --> 03:09:28,691
So all we can do...

1405
03:09:29,650 --> 03:09:32,111
...is pray those diesels start up.

1406
03:09:33,445 --> 03:09:36,115
Then full speed ahead
and off we go...

1407
03:09:36,699 --> 03:09:38,701
...out of this crater...

1408
03:09:39,618 --> 03:09:41,453
...and back home.

1409
03:09:43,205 --> 03:09:44,707
If it works...

1410
03:09:46,125 --> 03:09:48,711
...half a bottle of beer for everyone.

1411
03:09:52,673 --> 03:09:55,467
We just might get lucky.

1412
03:09:58,012 --> 03:10:00,180
They're not expecting us.

1413
03:10:07,730 --> 03:10:09,315
Well, men...

1414
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:13,319
...are we ready?

1415
03:10:18,699 --> 03:10:20,492
Contact bearings?

1416
03:10:20,659 --> 03:10:21,994
No contact.

1417
03:10:22,995 --> 03:10:25,497
Prepare to surface,
rescue gear ready.

1418
03:10:25,664 --> 03:10:27,333
Switch to red lights.

1419
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:31,170
Man your diving stations.

1420
03:10:56,445 --> 03:10:58,030
Blow tanks.

1421
03:12:13,313 --> 03:12:14,857
Boat rising!

1422
03:12:16,942 --> 03:12:19,111
Quiet men! Calm down!

1423
03:12:30,039 --> 03:12:31,790
270 metres.

1424
03:12:33,959 --> 03:12:35,794
First watch, get ready.

1425
03:12:36,545 --> 03:12:38,505
260 metres.

1426
03:12:45,304 --> 03:12:47,139
250 metres.

1427
03:12:55,981 --> 03:12:57,816
240 metres.

1428
03:13:03,822 --> 03:13:05,699
230 metres.

1429
03:13:11,163 --> 03:13:12,998
220.

1430
03:13:53,288 --> 03:13:54,915
Hatch is open.

1431
03:14:08,887 --> 03:14:10,597
How about the engines?

1432
03:14:16,061 --> 03:14:17,437
Both diesels.

1433
03:14:19,106 --> 03:14:21,316
Now everything hinges on this.

1434
03:14:47,426 --> 03:14:48,427
I think...

1435
03:14:48,677 --> 03:14:50,679
...it's running!

1436
03:14:50,846 --> 03:14:53,932
Who says you can't make something
out of nothing?

1437
03:15:15,954 --> 03:15:17,789
They won't get us this time.

1438
03:15:17,956 --> 03:15:19,458
Not again!

1439
03:15:23,128 --> 03:15:25,672
Hang in there, damn it.

1440
03:15:26,173 --> 03:15:27,966
Hang in there!

1441
03:15:28,634 --> 03:15:31,970
Three degrees to starboard.
Course 320 degrees.

1442
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:34,973
There he goes again!

1443
03:15:39,561 --> 03:15:41,813
They don't notice us.

1444
03:15:41,980 --> 03:15:44,983
They're all asleep in their bunks.

1445
03:15:49,363 --> 03:15:51,156
No, you know what?

1446
03:15:51,573 --> 03:15:54,743
They're at the casino,
celebrating our sinking!

1447
03:16:40,706 --> 03:16:44,543
Cheers, guys!
Here's to getting home!

1448
03:17:21,330 --> 03:17:23,790
As long as the diesels hold up...

1449
03:17:27,252 --> 03:17:29,504
...and with a little bit of luck...

1450
03:17:34,676 --> 03:17:36,928
...we'll make it home.

1451
03:17:42,809 --> 03:17:47,272
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
our returning sailors.

1452
03:18:20,055 --> 03:18:21,640
All engines stop.

1453
03:18:21,807 --> 03:18:23,141
Let go aft line.

1454
03:18:31,900 --> 03:18:37,239
We Build For Victory!

1455
03:18:49,167 --> 03:18:51,753
- Thanks, Hinrich.
- Don't mention it.

1456
03:18:51,920 --> 03:18:53,713
The sun's shining.

1457
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:55,507
Lift it!

1458
03:19:09,354 --> 03:19:11,857
All right? Almost there.
