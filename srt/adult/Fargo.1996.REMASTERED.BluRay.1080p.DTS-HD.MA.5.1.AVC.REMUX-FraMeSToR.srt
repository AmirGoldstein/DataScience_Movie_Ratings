40

Yeah, but it's not a
whole pay-in-advance deal.

41

My point is,

52
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,159
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

53
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:32,079
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

54

it's not me paying the ransom.

ask him for the money?

They don't know I need it, see?

70
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:09,241

And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

Thanks a bunch.

524
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:14,461
So what's the deal now?

525
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:15,754
Gary says triple homicide?

526
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,131
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

527
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,799
Two of them are over here.

528
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,801
Where is everybody?

529
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:23,679
Well, it's cold, Margie.

530
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:27,975
Watch your step, Margie.

531
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:39,737
Jeez. So...

532
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,031
(EXCLAIMS) Jeez!

533
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:43,991
Here's the second one!

534
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,828
It's in the head and the hand there.

535
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,165
I guess that's a defensive wound.

536
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:52,833
Oh, yeah?

537
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:55,920
Where's the state trooper?

538
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:59,673
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

539
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,175
Okay.

540
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,637
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

541
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,180
We got a shooting.

542
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:07,640
These folks drive by.

543
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,351
There's a high-speed pursuit, ends here,

544
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,645
and then this execution-type deal.

545
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:13,854
Yeah.

546
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:18,359
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

547
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:19,610
Yeah.

548
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,988
And I'll tell you what.

549
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:26,200
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

550
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:32,247
You see something down there, Chief?

551
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:35,125
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

552
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,335
Jeez.

553
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:38,879
You okay, Margie?

554
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:40,547
Yeah. I'm fine.

555
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:45,135
It's just morning sickness.

556
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,139
Well, that passed.

557
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:50,307
Yeah?

558
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,017
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

559
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,687
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

560
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,230
Oh, yeah.

561
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:57,815
Norm made some eggs.

562
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:59,066
Yeah?

563
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,068
Well...

564
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,238
What now, do you think?

565
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:06,407
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

566
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,328
There's different footprints here, Lou.

567
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:12,454
LOU: Yeah?

568
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,165
Yeah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.

569
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,542
Oh, yeah?

570
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,003
MARGE: For Pete's sake.

571
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,504
How's it look, Marge?

572
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:23,590
Well, he's got his
gun on his hip there,

573
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:26,510
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

574
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,554
It's a real shame.

575
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,972
LOU: Yeah.

576
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,476
Didn't monkey with
his car there, did you?

577
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,644
No way.

578
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:37,354
Well, somebody shut his lights.

579
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,856
I guess the little guy sat in there

580
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,334
waiting for his buddy to come back.

581
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:41,942
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

582
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,945
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

583
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,155
Dave?

584
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,699
You don't think he's mixed up in...

585
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:52,119
Oh, no, no. I just want to
get Norm some night crawlers.

586
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:56,832
Did you look in his citation book?

587
00:38:56,916 --> 00:39:02,129
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

588
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:04,423
Under plate number he put "DLR."

589
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,175
I figure they stopped him or shot him

590
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:09,303
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

591
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:12,890
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

592
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,059
They don't got no match yet.

593
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,103
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

594
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,230
on your police work there, Lou.

595
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:25,486
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

597
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:27,321
"DLR."

598
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:30,657
Oh.

599
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,827
Jeez.

600
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:36,789
Say, Lou,

601
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,017
did you hear the one about the guy

602
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,601
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

603
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,003
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

604
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,048
Yeah. That's a good one.

605
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:57,226
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

606
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,103
No. They said no cops.

607
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,938
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

608
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,042
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

609
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,483
Of course they're gonna say that.

610
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,610
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

611
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,612
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

612
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,496
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

613
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:11,573
Well, they...

614
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:12,802
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

615
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:14,595
- Yeah, but...
- There they are. They got my daughter.

616
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,120
Think this thing through here, Wade.

617
00:40:16,204 --> 00:40:19,123
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

618
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:22,084
You got to listen to
me on this one, Wade.

619
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,961
Heck, you don't know.

620
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:26,046
You're just whistling Dixie here.

621
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:28,132
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

622
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:29,466
I'm saying call a professional.

623
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,510
No. No cops.

624
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:35,013
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

625
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,140
Yeah.

626
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,183
Jean is my wife here.

627
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:41,145
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

628
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:42,229
Well...

629
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:44,481
We got to protect Jean. These...

630
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:46,316
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

631
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:48,360
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

632
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:49,570
You're darn tooting.

633
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:50,737
Oh, damn it.

634
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:51,989
I'm telling you.

635
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:54,449
Well, why don't we...

636
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:58,120
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

637
00:40:58,204 --> 00:40:59,621
Now, come on here!

638
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:01,665
No way, Wade.
No way.

639
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,149
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

640
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:04,209
Yeah.

641
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,014
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

642
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:07,212
Yeah.

643
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,884
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

644
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,595
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

645
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,323
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

646
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:17,514
Damn it!

647
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:21,810
How was everything today?

648
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:23,687
Yeah. Real good, now.

649
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:27,024
How you doing?

650
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:30,944
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

651
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,155
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

652
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,159
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

653
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,702
No, I...
They don't...

654
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:40,586
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

655
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:41,872
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

656
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:44,124
You know,
they said no one listening in.

657
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,375
They'll be watching.

658
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,419
You know, maybe it's all bull,

659
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:50,047
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

660
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:51,298
Okay.

661
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:54,343
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

662
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,138
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

663
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,515
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

666
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:18,325
How you doing there, Scotty?

667
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:19,993
Dad...

668
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,704
What are they doing?

669
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:25,207
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

670
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,959
It's okay, Scotty.

671
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,752
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

672
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:31,505
These men, they just want money.

673
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:34,341
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

674
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:38,011
No, no. Nothing's going wrong here.

675
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:42,307
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

676
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:45,394
I really think we should
call the cops here.

677
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:48,730
No. No. No one can
know about this thing.

678
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,108
We gotta play ball with these guys.

679
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:53,277
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

680
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:54,361
Yeah. But, Dad...

681
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:57,906
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

682
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,449
You know?

683
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,869
That's the deal here.

684
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,793
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

685
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:13,380
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

686
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:19,720
That's the best we can do here.

687
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,765
No!

00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,342
What are those?
Night crawlers?

702
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:04,491
Yeah.

703
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:05,826
Oh, thanks, hon.

704
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,953
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

705
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:10,205
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

706
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:13,166
What do we got here, Arby's?

707
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:14,751
How's the painting going?

708
00:45:14,836 --> 00:45:16,294
Pretty good.

709
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:19,756
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

710
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:21,925
Hon, you're better than them.

711
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:23,927
They're real good.

712
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:27,097
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

713
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:29,516
You think so?

714
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:33,437
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

715

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

716
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:37,899
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

717
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:39,526
NORM: Not too bad.
You know.

718
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,902
How we doing on that vehicle?

719
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:43,613
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

720
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:47,117
but the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox,

721
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:50,328
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

722
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:51,580
Jeez, that's a good lead.

723
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:52,747
LOU: Yeah.

724
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:55,292
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

725
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:58,003
Yeah. Owner was on the desk then.

726
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,005
Said these two had company.

727
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:01,214
Oh, yeah?

728
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,466
Yeah.

729
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:08,638
GIRL 1: Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

730
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:10,701
GIRL 2: I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

731
00:46:10,725 --> 00:46:11,808
Yeah, that's where we met.

732
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:12,976
But I dropped out, though.

733
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,144
Yeah.
She dropped.

734
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,228
Yeah.

735
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:17,022
So where you girls from?

736
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,982
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

737
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,193
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

738
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:22,569
Go Bears.

739
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:27,073
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

740
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,261
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

741
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:30,327
In what way?

742
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:32,329
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

743
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,748
Can you be any more specific?

744
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:36,166
I couldn't really say.

745
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,709
He wasn't circumcised.

746
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,630
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

747
00:46:41,714 --> 00:46:42,839
Yeah.

748
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,636
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

749
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:49,179
Uh-huh.

750
00:46:49,263 --> 00:46:51,306
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

751
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,226
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

752
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,353
More than most people, even.

753
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:57,646
What about the other fella?

754
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,855
He was a little older.

755
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,690
You know, he looked
like the Marlboro Man.

756
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:02,442
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

757
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:03,985
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

758
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,363
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

759
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:08,281
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

760
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:09,533
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

761
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:10,659
Yeah.

762
00:47:10,743 --> 00:47:12,744
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

763
00:47:12,828 --> 00:47:14,329
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

764
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:15,872
Yeah, is that useful to you?

765
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,541
You betcha. Yeah.

766
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

This is a nice place.

1056
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:20,568
Yeah. You know, it's the

1057
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:21,819
Yeah.

1058
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:27,366

1059
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:29,493
You're living in Edina, then?

1060

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065

1067
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,428
So, what brings you down?

1068
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:49,638
Are you down here on that homicide,

1069
01:02:49,723 --> 01:02:51,974
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

1070
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:53,350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:56,228
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1072
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:58,647
Okay.

1073
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,024
Well, what about you, Mike?

1074
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,358
Are you married?

1075
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:02,526
You got kids?

1076
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,403
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1077
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:07,656
I was married.
I was married to...

1078
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:09,658
You mind if I sit over here?

1079
01:03:09,743 --> 01:03:11,785
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1080
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,914
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1081
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,251
Okay.

1082
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:23,255
Sorry.

1083
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,091
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1084
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:28,427
Sure, sure. I understand.

1085
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:30,888
I didn't mean to...

1086
01:03:30,972 --> 01:03:34,433
No, no. That's fine.

1087
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:39,021
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1088
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,441
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1089
01:03:42,526 --> 01:03:45,319
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1090
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:46,862
Yeah. I think I remember her.

1091
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:49,698
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1092
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:51,367
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1093
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:55,037
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1094
01:03:55,121 --> 01:03:56,288
Well, they're a good outfit.

1095
01:03:56,373 --> 01:04:00,084
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1096
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:01,877
But it's not...

1097
01:04:01,962 --> 01:04:04,129
It's nothing like your achievement.

1098
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:07,216
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1099
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,884
It's not that...

1100
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:12,179
It's not that things
didn't work out. It's...

1101
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,433
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1102
01:04:17,227 --> 01:04:19,353
She was...
She passed away.

1103
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:20,813
No.

1104
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:24,400
It was tough.

1105
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:25,776
There you go.

1106
01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:27,903
It was long...

1107
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:31,865
She fought real hard, Marge.

1108
01:04:32,784 --> 01:04:34,159
You know...

1109
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:36,495
So, what can you say?

1110
01:04:39,457 --> 01:04:41,750
Better times, huh?

1111
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:43,294
Better times.

1112
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:50,676
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1113
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:52,595
I always liked you.

1114
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:53,929
Well, I always liked you...

1115
01:04:54,014 --> 01:04:55,723
I always liked you so much.

1116
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:02,730
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1117
01:05:02,814 --> 01:05:04,148
No! I...

1118
01:05:08,486 --> 01:05:10,112
I'm sorry. It's...

1119
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:12,615
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

1120
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:14,742
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1121
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:17,369
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1122
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:18,829
It's okay, Mike.

1123
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:21,457
You were such a super lady.

1124
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:24,793
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1125
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:29,173

01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,015
May I have your ticket, please?

1227
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:54,850
Open the fucking gate!

1228
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:35,807
Oh, jeez.

1229
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,130
SCOTTY: Dad?

1230
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:08,340
Yeah?

1231
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,550
Stan Grossman called.

1232
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:12,177
Yeah. Okay.

1233
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:13,303
Twice.

1234
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:14,429
Okay.

1235
01:13:16,432 --> 01:13:18,141
Is everything okay?

1236
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:19,643
Yeah.

1237
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:23,188
Are you calling Stan?

1238
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:26,900
Well, I'm...

1239
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:30,320
I'm going to bed now.

1240
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:08,316
MOHRA: How you doing?

1241
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:10,068
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1242
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:11,528
Officer Olson.

1243
01:14:11,612 --> 01:14:13,113
Yeah. Righto.

1244
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,157
Well...

1245
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:18,451
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1246
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:20,245
and this little guy's drinking,

1247
01:14:20,329 --> 01:14:22,330
and he says, "Where can
a guy find some action?

1248
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:24,666
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1249
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,251
And I says, "What kind of action?"

1250
01:14:26,335 --> 01:14:28,503
And he says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1251
01:14:28,588 --> 01:14:30,107
And I says, "Well,
what do I look like?

1252
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:32,299
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1253
01:14:32,383 --> 01:14:34,885
And he says, "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1254
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:38,221
And I says, "Yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place."

1255
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:41,808
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1256
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:43,435
Only he don't use the word "jerk."

1257
01:14:43,519 --> 01:14:45,122
- I understand.
- Then he calls me a jerk,

1258
01:14:45,146 --> 01:14:47,606
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1259
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,274
So, I don't say nothing.

1260
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:51,234
He says, "What do you
think about that?"

1261
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:54,738
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1262
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:55,864
You got that right.

1263
01:14:55,948 --> 01:14:57,699
Yeah, he says, "Yeah,
that guy's dead,

1264
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:59,284
"and I don't mean of old age."

1265
01:14:59,368 --> 01:15:02,871
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1266
01:15:02,955 --> 01:15:03,997
White Bear Lake?

1267
01:15:04,081 --> 01:15:06,601
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1268
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:07,751
So I made that assumption.

1269
01:15:07,835 --> 01:15:08,835
Sure.

1270
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,712
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1271
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:12,505
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1272
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,592
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1273
01:15:15,676 --> 01:15:19,804
and thought I should
call it in, so I called it in.

1274
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:23,642
End of story.

1275
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:25,787
Well, what'd this guy
look like, anyways?

1276
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:27,395
Oh, he's a...

1277
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,105
Little guy, kind of funny-looking.

1278
01:15:30,066 --> 01:15:31,399
In what way?

1279
01:15:31,484 --> 01:15:33,485
Just in a general kind of way.

1280
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:36,154
Okay. Well, thanks a
bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1281
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,906
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1282
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,199
but thanks for calling her in.

1283
01:15:39,283 --> 01:15:40,533
Sure.

1284
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:43,203
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1285
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:45,580
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1286
01:15:45,748 --> 01:15:47,958
Yeah.
You got that right.

1287
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:08,687
Jesus Christ.

1288
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:46,057
(GRUNTS)

1289
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:28,785
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1290
01:18:28,869 --> 01:18:31,329
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

1291
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,789
But you think he's all right?

1292
01:18:32,873 --> 01:18:34,040
I saw him last night and...

1293
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,125
<i>What did he say?</i>

1294
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:36,918
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1295
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:40,213
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1296
01:18:40,297 --> 01:18:42,215
<i>- His wife?
- Linda.</i>

1297
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:44,259
<i>- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.</i>

1298
01:18:44,343 --> 01:18:46,177
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

1299
01:18:46,262 --> 01:18:49,180
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

1300
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:52,350
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

1301
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:53,977
So...

1302
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,979
He didn't...

1303
01:18:56,522 --> 01:18:57,522
He never...

1304
01:18:57,606 --> 01:18:59,274
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

1305
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:01,860
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

1306
01:19:01,944 --> 01:19:03,319
Oh, my.

1307
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:04,946
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

1308
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,365
<i>He's living with his parents now.</i>

1309
01:19:08,534 --> 01:19:09,868
Oh, jeez.

1310
01:19:09,952 --> 01:19:12,328
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1311
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:13,997
Jeez. Well...

1312
01:19:14,623 --> 01:19:15,707
Jeez.

1313
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,127
That's a surprise.

1314
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,346
Hello!

1315
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:14,307
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1316
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:17,435
(STUTTERING) Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1317
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,021
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1318
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:22,941
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1319
01:20:23,025 --> 01:20:24,192
Do you mind if I sit down?

1320
01:20:24,276 --> 01:20:25,476
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1321
01:20:25,528 --> 01:20:26,653
No, I...

1322
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:28,507
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1323
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:29,531
I was just wondering...

1324
01:20:29,615 --> 01:20:32,742
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1325
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:34,911
Okay. Are you sure?

1326
01:20:35,913 --> 01:20:38,331
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1327
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,055
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating,

1328
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,335
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1329
01:20:42,419 --> 01:20:43,730
and they called
someone who works here,

1330
01:20:43,754 --> 01:20:45,440
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1331
01:20:45,464 --> 01:20:47,298
you know, connected.

1332
01:20:47,925 --> 01:20:49,300
Yeah, I see.

1333
01:20:49,468 --> 01:20:50,843
So, how do you...

1334
01:20:50,928 --> 01:20:53,054
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1335
01:20:53,138 --> 01:20:54,764
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1336
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:56,933
But how do you know that
for sure without doing a...

1337
01:20:57,017 --> 01:20:58,726
Well, I would know.

1338
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:00,562
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1339
01:21:00,646 --> 01:21:02,355
Yeah, but I understand...

1340
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:03,940
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1341
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:05,066
I know, but...

1342
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,193
Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1343
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:08,695
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1344
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:10,613
or what kind of a routine here?

1345
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:13,157
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1346
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:18,538
I'm sorry, sir?

1347
01:21:18,622 --> 01:21:20,915
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1348
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:22,625
I answered the darn...

1349
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:26,004
(STUTTERING) I'm cooperating
here, and there's no...

1350
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:32,510
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1351
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:34,095
I'm just doing my job here.

1352
01:21:34,179 --> 01:21:35,346
I'm...

1353
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:40,268
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1354
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,770
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1355
01:21:42,855 --> 01:21:44,897
We're doing all we can.

1356
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:54,449
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1357
01:21:58,412 --> 01:21:59,954
Mr. Lundegaard.

1358
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,586
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1359
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,297
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1360
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:12,300
Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

1361
01:22:12,384 --> 01:22:13,468
Sir, right now?

1362
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:15,178
Yeah! Right now.

1363
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:17,597
You're darn tooting!

1364
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:21,517
If it's so damned important to you.

1365
01:22:22,144 --> 01:22:23,811
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1366
01:22:23,896 --> 01:22:26,105
