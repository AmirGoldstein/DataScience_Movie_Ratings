1
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:13,425
Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello! I came specially to meet you,

2
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,898
I love your playing.

3
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:18,555
Who are you? My name's Dorota,
I'm Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,683
- You're bleeding!
- No, it's nothing.

5
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,854
Dorota, write him a fan letter later,
this isn't the best time, c'mon.

6
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,441
Jurek, why have you been hiding her?

7
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,615
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take to much!

8
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,827
- How many suitcases are you taking?
- And what... what you think,

9
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:46,625
should I take Uncle Szymon's portrait?
- Take it, don't take it, what you like.

10
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,463
- Can't you see I'm worried sick?
- Oh! He'll come home, he'll be all right.

11
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,300
Wiladek, oh! Mama, Wladek's home.

12
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,889
- Thank God Wladek! You're wounded!
- No, it's a little cut, it's nothing.

13
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:05,060
- I've been worried sick.
- You had your papers on you.

14
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,231
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd have known where to take you.

15
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:14,861
- Henryk, don't say things like that.
- What did I tell you?

16
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,032
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like we're doing?

17
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,203
- They bombed us, we're off the air.
- Warsaw's not the only radio station.

18
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:27,374
- Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
- Where are we going?

19
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,545
- Out of Warsaw. - Where?
- You haven't heard?

20
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,756
- Heard what?
- Oh. Where's the paper?

21
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:39,052
- I used it for packing.
- The government's moved to Lublin.

22
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,640
All able bodied men must go across the
river and set up a new line of defense.

23
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,811
There's hardly anybody left in this
building, only women, the men have gone.

24
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,482
Do you set up a new line of defense
with your luggage?

25
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,903
- Wiladek, there's no time for this.
- I'm not going anywhere.

26
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,074
- Good! I'm not going anywhere either!
- We've got to keep together.

27
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,245
No. If I'm going to die, I prefer
to die in my own home. I'm thankful.

28
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,416
- God forbid.
- You shut up! I've got something. Listen.

29
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,754
News has just been received from the
BBC in London. The British Government,

30
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:19,926
having received no reply to the ultimatum
presented to the German government,

31
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,263
has declared war on Nazi Germany

32
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:29,895
- Oh, it's wonderful, wonderful.
- It is expected that...

33
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,522
Don't, don't.

34
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:38,111
Within the next few hours,
France will make a similar declaration.

35
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:42,032
- My God!
- Poland is no longer alone.

36
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,494
Oh! It's great.

37
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,539
Wonderful!

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,170
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- Yes, it certainly was.

39
00:04:55,253 --> 00:05:00,801
- For this celebration I made an effort.
- Here's to Great Britain and France.

40
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:06,097
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
All will be well. Oh!

41
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,466
Five thousand and three.

42
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,637
- Is that all?
- Yes, 5'003 zlotys. That's all we have.

43
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,765
It's 3'003 zlotys too much.

44
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,936
Look: Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets:

45
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,107
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum
of 2'000 in their homes.

46
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,278
- What shall we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,448
Banks? Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

48
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,619
We could hide the money. Here, we could
hide the money under the flower pot.

49
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:15,417
No. We'll use tried and tested methods.
You know what we did in the last war?

50
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,629
We made a hole in the table leg
and we hid the money in there.

51
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,757
- And suppose they take the table away?
- What?

52
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:27,345
The Germans, they take what they want,
furniture, valuables, anything.

53
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,516
Idiot! What would they want
with a table? A table like this?

54
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,687
- What on earth are you doing?
- No, this is the best place for it,

55
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,901
- no one would looking under the flower pot.
- No, no. Listen, I've been thinking.

56
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,113
- Oh! Really that's a change.
- We use psychology.

57
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,326
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, and we cover it like this.

58
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,246
- In full view.
- Are you stupid?

59
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,501
- The Germans will never notice it.
- The stupidest thing I've ever seen.

60
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,839
Of course they'll notice it.
Look, look here! Idiot.

61
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,219
Oh! Oh! And you call me stupid.
No, that is very good.

62
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,348
- This will take hours.
- Oh!

63
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,810
- How would you get them out?
- I don't know, you use tweezers.

64
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,981
- Why do you resist everything?
- Quiet!

65
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,694
- Quiet please! Quiet! Order, please!
- She's a lawyer. She likes order.

66
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,865
Listen. Just listen. Look,
the watch we'll put under the flowerpot

67
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,285
and the money we'll stuff in the violin.

68
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:38,249
- Will I still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

69
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,921
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek? How are you?

70
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,634
- Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
- Fine. We're fine in the circumstances.

71
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,805
But I can guess what you've called about.
There's nothing we can do.

72
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:56,017
- They won't re-open the station.
- Yes, I know, but Jurek...

73
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,647
Not even music. No radios for the Poles.
But I'm sure you'll find work,

74
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,860
a pianist like you Wladek!
- Well. Maybe, maybe not.

75
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:10,740
Listen, don't be offended, but I didn't
call to discuss my future career.

76
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,787
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.
Then he said: "All right, come with me."

77
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,958
And so I came
and they bombed the station.

78
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,129
I tell you meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
- Really?

79
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,800
- Yes! It was unforgettable.
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.

80
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,971
- Call me Wladek, please.
- No one plays Chopin like you.

81
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,142
- I hope that's a compliment.
- Of course! I mean it!

82
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,312
Who knows! I tried to be funny. Shall we
go to the Paradiso, have a coffee?

83
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,274
I'd like that.

84
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,445
- And you. What do you do?
- Oh, I finished at the conservatoire.

85
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,573
- You're a musician?
- Yes, but only just...

86
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,701
- I'm sorry, what instrument?
- The cello.

87
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,955
I love to see a woman playing the cello.
Here we are.

88
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,046
- This is disgraceful! How dare they!
- You know people are like.

89
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,216
- They want to be better Nazis then Hitler.
- I'm going in there to complain.

90
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,387
- Don't. It's better not. Believe me.
- It's so humiliating. Someone like you.

91
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,599
Good-bye!

92
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,980
- We'll find somewhere else.
- We could walk in the park.

93
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:29,235
No. We can't. It's an official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

94
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,947
- Are you joking?
- It's true.

95
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,619
That's another official decree,
no Jews allowed on public benches.

96
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,790
- This is absurd!
- I tell you what we can do.

97
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,086
We can just stand here and talk.

98
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,006
So, you play the cello, Dorota,
that's nice.

99
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,510
Who's your favorite composer? Chopin?

100
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,598
You'll have to learn his cello sonata,
won't you? "And what about you, Wladek?"

101
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,311
Perhaps, I could accompany you,
me on the piano, you on the cello.

102
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,981
Oh, Mr. Szpilman,
you're quite wonderful.

103
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,736
Call me Wladek, please.

104
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,116
"Re: emblems for Jews in the
Warsaw District. I hereby order

105
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,286
that all Jews in the Warsaw District
will wear visible emblems

106
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,126
when out of doors. This decree will come
into force on the 1st of December 1939

107
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,213
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

108
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:35,385
The emblem will be worn on the right
sleeve and will represent a blue Star

109
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,805
of David on a white background.

110
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,226
The background must be sufficiently
large for the Star to measure

111
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,564
8 centimeters from point to point.
The width of the arms of the Star

112
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,733
must be one centimeter.

113
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:55,905
Jews who do not respect this decree
will be severely punished.

114
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,117
Governor of Warsaw District,

115
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,954
Dr Fischer."

116
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:09,252
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

117
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,633
Let me see this.

118
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,932
Doesn't it say we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

119
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:28,062
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them!

120
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,866
You!

121
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,077
Come here!

122
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,002
Why didn't you bow?

123
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,214
I'm sorry.

124
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,060
You are forbidden
to walk on the pavement.

125
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,271
Walk in the gutter!

126
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,666
- Have you seen this?
- What, what? I'm working!

127
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,753
What is it?

128
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:39,342
- That's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean, put us?

129
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,554
"By order of the Governor of the
Warsaw District, Dr Fischer,

130
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:47,725
concerning the Establishment
of the Jewish District in Warsaw.

131
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,896
There will be created a Jewish District
in which all Jews living in or moving

132
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,108
to Warsaw will have to reside."
Look here:

133
00:12:55,316 --> 00:13:00,863
"Jews living outside of the prescribed
area will have to move to the

134
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,075
Jewish district by 31st of October, 1940."

135
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,414
They won't get all of us... it's too
small. There's 400'000 of us in Warsaw!

136
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:14,836
- No. 360'000, so it'll be easy.
- So what am I supposed to do?

137
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,007
You're a clever man
you'll tell me what I will buy.

138
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,218
- I do my best.
- Mama!

139
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,389
Mama, what is it?

140
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,727
Twenty zlotys.

141
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,355
That's all we have left. Twenty zlotys.

142
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,736
What can I buy with twenty zlotys?

143
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:47,577
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

144
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,587
That's the price. That's I'm offering.
And my advice is to accept.

145
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,758
- You won't get more from anyone else.
- But, but it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa.

146
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,554
My advice is to take it. What you going
to do when you're hungry? Eat the piano?

147
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,725
- Get out! You're a thieving bastard!
- Hey! What's the matter with you?

148
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,936
- Get out!
- What you suffering from?

149
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,817
Hey! You people are crazy!
I'm doing you a favor,

150
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,280
two thousand,
and I'm paying for the removal,

151
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,451
I'm not even charging for the removal.
You haven't eaten today, you're crazy

152
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,662
Take it.

153
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,990
Dorota!

154
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,701
Hi! Hello.

155
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,913
I didn't want to come,

156
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,960
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

157
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,214
- How are you doing?
- Good.

158
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,468
No, not really, they arrested my cousin.

159
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,805
Jurek says they'll let him out.

160
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:36,060
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

161
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,272
That's what I said, it's so...

162
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,900
it's too absurd!

163
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,157
Hey, I... I should...

164
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,036
Well I... I'll see you soon.

165
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,498
Ok.

166
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,421
Goodbye!

167
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,979
Well, to tell you the truth,

168
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,233
I thought it would be worse.

169
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,826
- How will we sleep?
- The girls and I sleep in the kitchen.

170
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,079
You, Henryk and Papa in here!

171
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,584
Look!

172
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,962
Come and look.

173
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,457
Go away, go away, go away.

174
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,669
Papa! Papa!

175
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,214
Papal!

176
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:45,523
- You sell anything?
- Only Dostoievsky, "The Idiot". 3 zlotys.

177
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,360
- That's better than yesterday.
- 3 lousy Zlotys.

178
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,906
Others are making millions.
-I know. You don't know, believe me.

179
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,119
They bribe the guards.
The guards turn a blind eye.

180
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,832
They're bringing in carloads, food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics,

181
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,003
- the poor are dying, they don't carry.
- Excuse me,

182
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,173
have you seen my husband Izaak Szerman?
A tall handsome man.

183
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,344
- With a little gray beard? No?
- I'm afraid not.

184
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,724
No? Oh, excuse me
Ok, Goodbye, sleep well, but...

185
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,687
but if you see him, write to me,
yes, Izaak Szerman!

186
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:44,957
Why does a gentile street
has to cross our area?

187
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,754
Don't worry about it, they're about
to build a bridge, haven't you heard?

188
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,882
A bridge, a smedge.

189
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,303
And the Germans claim to be intelligent.
You know what I think?

190
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,932
I think they're totally stupid.
I've a family to feed.

191
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:06,312
I spend half my time here waiting
for them to let us through.

192
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,815
- I didn't come here to listen to the music.
- Hey, what's going on?

193
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,986
- Are you bored?
- You're cold? Come on, move!

194
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,158
- Move on!
- Yeah! That's it! Dance!

195
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,912
- Dance!
- Come on, dance! Go on!

196
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:33,172
Yeah, that's nice. And you?
Don't you wanna dance, too?

197
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:38,761
Now we clear the street for
a jewish dancefloor.

198
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,597
And... you...

199
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,809
Yes, you both!

200
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,902
Faster!

201
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,114
That's nice.

202
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,284
And faster! Yeah...

203
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,914
- Go!
- And faster!

204
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,126
I said, faster!

205
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:16,257
Move on! Move! Faster!

206
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,885
I said, dance!

207
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,198
Good, they're here,

208
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,785
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.

209
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,171
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

210
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,931
- So what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes, his...

211
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:12,188
His father's back in the jewelry.
Businesses and doing well, Yitzchak?

212
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,941
- Amazing. Jewelry.
- We're recruiting.

213
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,237
- Who's recruiting?
- I've come here as a friend.

214
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,909
Almost half a million Jews from
the entire country are in the Ghetto.

215
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,079
- We need more Jewish police.
- Oh? More Jewish police?

216
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:33,250
You want me to beat up Jews with my
truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit?

217
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,421
- Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
- I thought all you only recruited boys

218
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:42,051
with rich fathers. Look at us...
- I'm looking at you, that's why I'm here.

219
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,597
Your whole family can have a better life.
You want to go on selling books?

220
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,434
- Yes, please.
- I'm doing you people a favor.

221
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:55,773
Wiladek, you're a great pianist. And we've
got an excellent police Jazz band.

222
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:00,027
- They'd welcome you with open arms.
- Thank you. But I've got work.

223
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:49,285
- I can't hear anything. It's too loud.
- Yes of course!

224
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,289
I'm sorry, Wladek,
he wants you to stop.

225
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,667
Who wants me to stop?

226
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:51,096
I always say look on the bright side.
You're in the small ghetto, intellectuals,

227
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,684
professional people. Here, in the
large ghetto, it's a cesspool.

228
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,855
- Jehuda, give me something to do.
- You're an artist, you keep...

229
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:04,109
people's spirits up. You do enough.
- But I want to help, I...

230
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,321
You're too well known. And you know what?

231
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:13,285
You musicians don't make good
conspirators. You're too... too...

232
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,956
musical!

233
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,002
Who is there?

234
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,922
- Symche!
- Majorek.

235
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,468
There are notices going up.
The city's to be cleaned of undesirables.

236
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:34,723
- No notices going up...
- Hello, Symche, Dolek,

237
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,393
Mrs. Zyskind,

238
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,521
- Jehuda. Working hard?
- Majorek...

239
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,692
This is the greatest pianist in Poland,
maybe in the whole world.

240
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,653
Wiladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.

241
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,781
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

242
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,952
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the army.

243
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:59,623
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

244
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,919
You'd better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

245
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:09,299
You know how many copies we print
of our newspaper? Five hundred.

246
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:13,470
You know how many people on average
read on copy? Twenty.

247
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:17,641
That makes ten thousand readers.
These will start the uprising.

248
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,812
Majorek hides them in his underpants.
And leaves them in toilets.

249
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,982
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

250
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:30,112
Germans never use Jewish toilets.
They're too clean for them.

251
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,784
Please, a piece of bread,
please, please Mister,

252
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,245
please one zloty.

253
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,943
You little bastard!

254
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,326
Stop it, stop it!

255
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,537
Stop it! Stop!

256
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,875
Come on, come on! Come on boy.

257
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,297
Come on.

258
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,134
Stand up, stand up!

259
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,638
Stand up, stand up!

260
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:09,211
And please, tonight, for once,
I don't want anything bad talked about.

261
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,382
- Enjoy our meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

262
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,510
- You know Dr. Raszeja.
- The surgeon.

263
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,681
The surgeon. Well, for some reason,
don't ask me why, the Germans allowed him

264
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,185
into the Ghetto to perform an operation.
- They allowed a Pole to operate a Jew?

265
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,439
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so he puts the patient to sleep

266
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:34,236
and starts the operation. He'd just made
the first incision when the SS burst in,

267
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,284
shoot the patient lying on the table,
then Dr Raszeja and everybody else there.

268
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,412
Isn't that a laugh?

269
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,583
The patient didn't feel a thing.
He was anaesthetized.

270
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,379
- I said nothing bad, Henryk.
- What's the matter with you all?

271
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,550
- You lost your sense of humor?
- It's not funny.

272
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,346
Well, you know what's funny?
You're funny with that ridiculous tie.

273
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,517
What's my tie got to do with anything?
I need the tie for my work.

274
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,688
- Your work?
- Yes. I tried. I work.

275
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,317
- Playing the piano for all this parasites.
- Boys...

276
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,030
- They don't care about people's sufferings.
- You blame me for their apathy.

277
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:23,243
- They don't notice what's going on around.
- I blame the Americans.

278
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:27,664
- For what? For my tie?
- American Jews, there are a lots of them.

279
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:33,170
What have they done for us?
People are dying, nothing to eat.

280
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:38,383
The Jewish bankers should be persuading
America to declare war on Germany.

281
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,904
Lights! Lights!

282
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,176
Open up! Light on!

283
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,056
Quick! Come here!

284
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,558
Stay!

285
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,896
Open up! Come on! No luggage!

286
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,693
- Open up!
- No, please, no!

287
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,113
We didn't do anything, please, no!

288
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,834
Stand up!

289
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,088
You, stand up! Get up!

290
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,259
Throw him out!

291
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,565
- Ah!
- Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake!

292
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,568
My God!

293
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,706
- Come on! Run! Run!
- Run!

294
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,728
Matches! Matches!

295
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,858
Excuse me! I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.

296
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,361
Yes. Come in! Not you!

297
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,300
- What's happened?
- It's terrible!

298
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:12,848
They're hunting people on the streets.
They've taken Henryk.

299
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,727
All right, go home, all right, go home.
I'll take care of it.

300
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,649
You children,
can't you find somewhere else to beg!

301
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,658
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband Izaak Szerman?

302
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,829
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, a little grey beard.

303
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,083
If you see him, write to me,
don't forget, Izaak Szerman!

304
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,421
Faster, keep moving! Run!

305
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,305
- What's happened here?
- They've got my grandson in there.

306
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,476
They pick'em up. They take'em away.
What do they do to them?

307
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,604
I've stopped believing in God.

308
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,815
Excuse me. Excuse me.

309
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,860
Yitzchak?

310
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,071
Yitzchak? Yitzchak, here!

311
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,283
It's Wladek Szpilman!

312
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:20,290
- Henryk's in there.
- I haven't seen him.

313
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,378
- Believe me, they've picked him up.
- Tough luck!

314
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,843
- Can you help?
- Oh, now you need me, yes, yes...

315
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,096
- Can you help us?
- It costs.

316
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,892
- I've no money.
- Well, sorry.

317
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,772
- You should have joined us earlier.
- They told me you had influence.

318
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,984
- Who told you?
- People... people I know.

319
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,196
They said you're an important man.

320
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,908
Yitzchak!

321
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,298
Urem rach, ale glach!
Ingl haltoch! Ale glach!

322
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,511
- Hey, Mr Rubinstein.
- You... bandit!

323
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,432
- Boom, boom. Dead!
- I am really scared.

324
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,603
For this joke Mr Rubinstein
gets a cigarette, hm?

325
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,815
Ingl haltoch! Cigarettes, thank you.

326
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,362
- Ale glach...
- Right. All men are created equal.

327
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,950
Only the Germans are created
a little more equal.

328
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,121
- Ale glach, ale glach, ale glach...
- Good bye.

329
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,332
Ale glach, ale glach. Ingl haltoch!

330
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,336
Ingl haltoch! Ale glach.

331
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,674
Help! Help! Help! Help!

332
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,485
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Yitzchak Heller,

333
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,656
did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

334
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:02,786
- Did you grovel to that piece of shit?
- I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

335
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,914
What did you pay him?

336
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,085
With what... With what can I pay him?
Every zloty I earn we spend on food!

337
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,255
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

338
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,426
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you. Why do...

339
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,640
you interfere into other's business?
- You're mad, that's your trouble.

340
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,227
That's also my business.

341
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,735
Hey, hey! What's the matter?

342
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,989
- What's the matter? You're sick?
- Hungry.

343
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,123
Mr. Szpilman!

344
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:53,503
Employment certificate? What's that mean,
no employment certificate?

345
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,673
You have to have an employment certificate

346
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,844
to work for one of the German firms
in the ghetto, otherwise...

347
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:05,014
- You'll be deported.
- So the rumors were true.

348
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:10,520
They're going to resettle us.
Send us to labor camps. In the East.

349
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:16,151
- And they're closing the small ghetto.
- My God.

350
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,751
Wiladek! Wladek!

351
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,921
I thought you'd be off on tour,
playing London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

352
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,049
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

353
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:44,220
Have you heard the rumors?
They're going to resettle us in the East.

354
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,391
Rumors, you take it all too much
to heart, Wladek. What's the trouble?

355
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,562
I've been trying to get a certificate
of employment for my father.

356
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:57,233
I've been trying all the firms and...

357
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,404
- Why didn't you come to me?
- I didn't know you're in this business.

358
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,616
I'm not but Majorek is.

359
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,622
- Can you help? I've no money.
- Please, don't insult us!

360
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,502
- Can you do something for him?
- Schultz Workshop tomorrow, 4 o'clock.

361
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:20,298
You see? That's the historical
imperative in action.

362
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,552
- That's why I always say, look...
- The bright side, yes I know.

363
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,318
- How is your back?
- Better.

364
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,403
Better?

365
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,615
Better no ask!

366
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,755
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

367
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,050
It won't help you anyway!

368
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,471
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

369
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,092
Tempo, Tempo.
Go, hopp, hopp, hopp! Faster!

370
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,929
Faster! Faster!

371
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,267
Come on, go!

372
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,275
Tempo!

373
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:24,589
At least we've got work in the ghetto?
At least we're still together.

374
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,345
Out! Assemble in the yard!

375
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,857
Out! Assemble in the yard!
Go, go, go, go!

376
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:50,698
We're employed here.
We've got certificates.

377
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,786
Wiladek!

378
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,913
Here.

379
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,083
You, to the left!

380
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,752
You!

381
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,964
You! You!

382
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,385
You!

383
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,888
You!

384
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,308
You!

385
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:29,445
The rest of you get dressed and then
report back here. Bring your belongings.

386
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,700
- Fifteen kilos only.
- Where are you taking us?

387
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,186
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought...

388
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,316
the certificates would save us.
- Stop it, Wladek. Let's hope,

389
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,695
Henryk and Halina will be better off.

390
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,877
Go, go, go!

391
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,637
Move on!

392
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,184
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

393
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:45,980
You'll be much better off
than in this stinking ghetto.

394
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,399
Move! Move!

395
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,864
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

396
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,787
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

397
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,292
Why?

398
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,922
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

399
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:45,164
I beg you, don't you have
a drop of water? I beg you, I beg you.

400
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,254
Don't you have a drop of water?
He's dying, my child is dying of thirst!

401
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:55,424
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you have a drop of water?

402
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,595
Did you hear what I'm saying?
I'm telling you it's a disgrace.

403
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,766
- We're letting them take us to our death.
- Dr Ehrlich, not so loud.

404
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,937
There's half a million of us here,
we could break out of the ghetto.

405
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,108
At least we could die honorably
not as a stain on the face of history.

406
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,779
- Why you so sure that we're dying?
- I'm not sure.

407
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:21,617
- They plan to wipe us all out!
- Do you want me to fight?

408
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:26,706
- You need organization, plans, guns.
- Right. Fight them with my violin bow?

409
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,419
The Germans would never squander
a huge lab our force like this.

410
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:36,090
- They're sending us to a labor camp.
- Look at that cripple, there,

411
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:40,261
look at the old people, the children,
they're gonna work?

412
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:45,558
Look at you! Well, you're going
to carry iron girders on your back?

413
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,142
Henryk! Halina! Henryk!

414
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,479
Halina! Henryk!

415
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:42,531
We heard you were here,
we wanted to be with you.

416
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:56,545
- We wanted to be with you.
- Stupid, stupid!

417
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,967
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

418
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,595
She's getting on my nerves.

419
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,479
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

420
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:18,859
They'd prepared a hiding place and so,
of course, they went there.

421
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,029
But the baby cried as the police came.

422
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:27,034
She smothered the cries with her hands.
The baby died.

423
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:32,206
A policeman heard the death rattle.
He found where they were hiding.

424
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,608
What are you reading?

425
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,906
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

426
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,411
If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us,

427
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,622
shall we not revenge?"

428
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:23,132
- Very appropriate.
- Yes, that's why I brought it.

429
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:45,446
Idiot. What's he think
he's going to do with the money?

430
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,657
Hey, boy, come here.

431
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,994
Come here!

432
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,247
- How much for a caramel?
- Twenty zlotys.

433
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,627
- What you're going to do with the money?
- Twenty zlotys.

434
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:05,466
Have we got twenty between us?
I've got ten, I think.

435
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,765
Five. Ten. Twenty.

436
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,196
Why did I do it?

437
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,538
Why did I do it?

438
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,138
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

439
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,498
Come on, come on,

440
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,667
keep on!

441
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,297
- Keep moving!
- Go! Move on

442
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,350
- Halina?
- What?

443
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,397
- It's a funny time to say this but...
- What?

444
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,693
I wish, I knew you better.

445
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,991
Thank you.

446
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,752
- Go on! Move on!
- Go till the end of the train!

447
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,005
Move on, go, go!

448
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,259
Szpilman! Szpilman!

449
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,309
Fuck off! Stupid! Go!

450
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,521
Papa! Papa!

451
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,191
Papal!

452
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,029
- Halina! Mama!
- What do you do, Szpilman?

453
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:38,410
I've saved your life!
Get out, just go! Go!

454
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,207
Don't run!

455
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,085
Mama!

456
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,296
Mama! Mama!

457
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,675
Move on, go!

458
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:01,350
Move!

459
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,778
- Well, off they go to the melting pot.
- Yes!

460
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:20,744
Give it to me, you don't need it anymore.
Gimme that!

461
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,831
Papal!

462
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,334
What are you doing? She's pregnant!

463
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,276
Wiladek.

464
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:18,338
- Why are you here, Wladek?
- It's like this...

465
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,218
I... We...

466
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,558
We... all of them... all of them...

467
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:36,898
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker the better.

468
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:41,987
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here
for two days until things die down.

469
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,241
I've bribed a policeman.
He'll come when it's over.

470
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,245
Left about turn!

471
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,457
Forward, march!

472
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:12,643
- I haven't been outside for two years.
- Don't get over excited.

473
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,970
- Someone you know?
- Yes. 

474
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:56,979
- A beauty. Who is she?

475
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:01,149
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband's an actor.

476
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:06,738
- Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
- They hang them for helping Jews.

477
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,436
Left about turn!

478
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,647
Forward, march!

479
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,195
- Stop! Come here!
- Stop!

480
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:59,374
- What's that?
- A working column.

481
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,296
Right turn!

482
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:14,306
You, come here!

483
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,726
You!

484
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,396
You! You!

485
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,733
You!

486
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,571
Down!

487
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:32,783
Down!

488
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,188
Left about turn!

489
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,400
Forward, march!

490
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,629
Did you fix the car?

491
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,394
You know, it'll break!

492
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,818
- How long have you been here?
- Since last night.

493
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,448
I was pleased to see you.

494
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,872
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

495
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,043
We know what it means.

496
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:11,131
We sent someone out.
Zygmunt. A good man.

497
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,678
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

498
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:22,642
He got to Sokolow. A local railway man
told him the tracks're divided,

499
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,854
one branch leading to Treblinka.

500
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:30,108
He said every day freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw

501
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:34,279
branched off to Treblinka
and returned empty.

502
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:38,450
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

503
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:43,955
And civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

504
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,377
They're exterminating us.

505
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,050
Won't take them long.

506
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:00,013
We're sixty thousand left.
Out of half a million.

507
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,850
Mostly young people.

508
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,813
And this time we're gonna to fight.

509
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:12,317
We're in good shape,

510
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,529
organized. We're prepared.

511
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,616
If you need help. I...

512
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,038
Go, go! Faster!

513
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,721
You! Come here!

514
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,017
Shit!

515
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,067
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

516
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:59,239
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm thinking.

517
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,909
Please no! Please no!

518
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:06,121
Please no.

519
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,793
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!

520
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,964
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!

521
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,093
And-zick! And-zack!

522
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,687
Get him away from here.

523
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:51,082
Hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

524
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,252
Won't last long if he goes on like this.

525
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:58,632
I'll see
if I can get him something better.

526
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,114
- Trouble!
- Assemble! Fall in!

527
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,618
- Only the Jews!
- Only the Jews!

528
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:30,789
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!

529
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,424
I have good news for you.

530
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:45,595
There are rumors go around that we'll...

531
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:50,058
like to "umsiedeln"... Resettle you...

532
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:55,689
I promise you that now
and in the future

533
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:59,567
nothing else is planned.

534
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:07,075
Ja? For these reasons, we put
information posters on the wall.

535
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:14,624
To show you our good will.
You should vote one of you

536
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,962
who be allowed to go in town daily

537
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:24,592
and bring three kilos Kartoffeln,
potatoes,

538
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,723
ja, and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

539
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:36,646
So why should we do something else
like this if we would resettle you?

540
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:43,653
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

541
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:49,617
Isn't that something where you,
Jews, are good in, make money.

542
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,540
Carry on.

543
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:16,644
That one with the string.
The others tied by wire.

544
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:46,049
What are you doing? Go on working!

545
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:07,195
Hurry up! It's fucking cold.

546
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:18,039
- It's so cold.
- Potatoes. Once again potatoes.

547
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,465
Now!

548
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,337
Majorek.

549
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,300
I have a favor to ask.

550
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,803
I want to get out of here.

551
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:20,310
It's easy to get out, it's how you
survive on the other side that's hard.

552
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,104
I know. But...

553
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:27,275
Last summer, I worked for a day
in Zelazna Brama Square.

554
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:32,238
I saw someone I knew.
She's an old friend a singer.

555
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,450
Her husband's an actor.

556
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:40,330
I filled their names and their
address down. If they're still there.

557
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:45,418
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.
They're good people.

558
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,631
Would you try and make contact?

559
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,510
I mean, you go into the town every day.

560
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,764
Would you just ask them
if they'd help me get out of here?

561
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:32,257
Any fucking plaster?

562
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,010
Yes.

563
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,227
What were you up to?

564
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:47,814
Nothing. What the fuck are those?

565
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,694
We're allowed
to take food into the ghetto.

566
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,072
Three kilos of potatoes and a...

567
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:59,284
Open it.

568
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,661
Yes.

569
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:07,750
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying, I can smell it.

570
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,546
- Open it.
- Yes, yes.

571
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,575
- I... I...
- Potatoes.

572
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,373
You're all the same.

573
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,793
Give a Jew a little finger...

574
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,213
he takes the whole hand.

575
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:12,774
You lie to me again
and I'll shoot you personally.

576
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:40,093
I tried your friends.
They don't live there anymore. But...

577
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,846
- You made contact?
- Be ready to leave.

578
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,932
- When?
- Soon.

579
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,518
Stop!

580
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,105
- Oh, shit.
- Just wait!

581
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:57,026
- What's going in here?
- And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!

582
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,613
And-zick! And-zack! And-zick! And-zack!

583
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:08,371
I'll soon teach you discipline!
Jew pigs!

584
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,961
- Know why we beat you?
- No.

585
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,548
- Know why we beat you?
- Why?

586
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,051
To celebrate New Year's eve!

587
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:30,017
- Now, march! Go on, march!
- Beware, go on! And sing!

588
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,896
Sing something cheerful!
And sing it now and loud!

589
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:05,678
Do you have a cigarette?

590
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,932
Do you have a match?

591
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,872
I'm sorry. I'm dirty. I'm so filthy...

592
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,518
Andrzej...

593
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,483
We haven't much time. Come on.

594
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:35,828
You must hurry. Here. See if these fit.

595
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,041
We're going to have to keep moving you.
The Germans are hunting down

596
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:45,463
indiscriminately now. Jews, non-Jews,
anybody, everybody. And Wladek,

597
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:49,717
you'd better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

598
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:07,652
Marek Gebczynski will look after you.
He's on the other side of town.

599
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:12,239
You'll stay there tonight.
Then we'll find you somewhere else

600
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,702
- I'll bring you food.
- All right. Let's go.

601
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,996
I'll show you
where you're going to sleep.

602
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:35,072
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow
afternoon. We have a flat for you.

603
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:38,743
Near the Ghetto wall. But it's safe.

604
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:49,795
- It's not going to be very comfortable.
- I'll be fine.

605
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,476
Thank you!

606
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,993
I'll take it. Give it to me.

607
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:27,166
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

608
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,264
May I ?

609
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,426
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

610
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:28,936
But you leave them open during
the daytime. Don't forget.

611
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:34,608
Must feel better
on this side of the wall. Hm?

612
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,278
Yes.

613
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:43,284
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

614
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:48,080
Some bread, potatoes, onions.
I'll come again.

615
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:52,293
And Janina Bogucki will visit
twice a week. Bring more food.

616
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:55,504
- See how you are.
- Thank you.

617
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:02,094
Oh, this is very important,
in case of emergency,

618
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:06,849
I mean, emergency, go to this address.

619
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:53,938
- What do you mean you forgot?
- What? I forgot, that's what I mean.

620
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:58,108
You know what? You treat me like dirt!

621
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:01,237
- Because you are dirt.
- Pig!

622
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,781
- Cow!
- Dirty pig!

623
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:09,036
- You're a dirty pig!
- Takes one to know one! Pig!

624
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:17,586
- Hm. You play like an angel, Kitten.
- Why don't you listen?

625
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:23,092
- I was listening, Kitten.
- Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!

626
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,296
Fire!

627
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,550
Unit, move!

628
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,662
Thank you.

629
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:45,461
- I wanted to come earlier but...
- No, no, no. Thank you.

630
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:52,009
No one thought they'd hold out so long.

631
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:56,555
- I should've fought with them.
- Wladek, stop that.

632
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:01,059
It's over now. Just be proud it happened.

633
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:04,730
- My God, did they put a fight.
- Yes.

634
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,068
- So did the Germans.
- They're in shock.

635
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:15,365
They didn't expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back?

636
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:20,704
- Who'd have thought?
- Yes, but what good did it do?

637
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:24,791
What good?
Wiladek, I'm surprised at you.

638
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:31,298
They died with dignity, that's what
good it did. And you know something else?

639
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,719
Now the Poles will rise. We're ready.

640
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,972
We'll fight too. You'll see.

641
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:57,533
Get your things together,
you have to leave.

642
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:01,954
- What? What's happened?
- I'm on the run.

643
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:06,667
- What's happened?
- The Gestapo found our weapons.

644
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,380
They've arrested Janina and Andrze.
They're find out about this place, too.

645
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,551
- You must get away at once.
- Where do you want me to go?

646
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,721
Look at me. I'm not leaving.

647
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:23,892
- Can't I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

648
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:28,480
But when they storm into the flat,
throw yourself out of the window.

649
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:33,318
I have poison on me,
they won't get me alive either.

650
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,557
Open up.

651
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:57,397
Open this door at once,
or we'll call the police!

652
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:28,929
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

653
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:33,099
It belongs a friend of mine. I just came
to visit but I must have just missed him.

654
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:36,561
- Have you got your identity card?
- Yes.

655
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40,732
- Let me see your identity card!
- Yes, of course...

656
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,277
- identity card!
- What's happening?

657
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:48,365
He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the Jew!

658
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:54,037
Don't let him out! Stop him!

659
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:09,738
- Yes?
- Mr Gebczynski sent me.

660
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,956
- Wiladyslaw Szpilman!
- Dorota!

661
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:25,337
Come In.

662
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:35,096
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I was given this address.

663
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:40,517
- I'm looking for a Mr Dzikiewicz.
- Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.

664
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,647
Come In.

665
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:53,031
Sit.

666
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:58,411
I need help.

667
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:05,043
- He'll be back before curfew.
- I've... I've been in hiding.

668
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:10,840
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

669
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:15,637
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

670
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:21,059
- And how's Jurek?
- Dead.

671
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:26,106
Oh.

672
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:33,113
- And when's your baby due?
- Christmas.

673
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:38,994
This is not a good time
to have children. But then...

674
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:43,373
This is my husband.
Wiladyslaw Szpilman.

675
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:48,545
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Oh, yes. I remember.

676
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:53,299
Mr Gebczynski said to contact you
only in case of emergency but...

677
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:56,511
Don't worry now.

678
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:09,149
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

679
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:15,530
Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry, could...

680
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,660
Could I have a piece of bread?

681
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,789
Yes, of course, we'll eat.

682
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:28,585
Sit, please, sit.

683
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,213
Thank you.

684
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,843
You're in a very German area.

685
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:48,099
The building opposite is a hospital
taking in wounded from the Russian front.

686
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,519
The next door is the Schutzpolizei.

687
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:58,026
Safest place to be.
Right in the heart of the lion's den.

688
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:05,783
I'll be locking you in.

689
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:12,123
No one knows you are here.
So keep as quiet as possible.

690
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,879
- All well?
- Thank you.

691
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:32,305
This is Antek Szalas.
He will be looking after you.

692
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,516
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Thank you.

693
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,772
I've given him a second key.
He'll bring you food.

694
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:45,777
See that you're all right. He's with
the underground. He's a good man.

695
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:53,368
- You don't remember me, Mr Szpilman?
- I don't think so.

696
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:55,745
Warsaw Radio.

697
01:37:55,828 --> 01:38:00,500
I was a technician.
I saw you almost every day.

698
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:06,130
- Sorry, I don't remember, I...
- Doesn't matter.

699
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:11,511
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

700
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:16,724
And you'll be pleased to hear the Allies
are bombing Germany night after night.

701
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:21,187
- Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.
- And the Russians giving them hell.

702
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,440
- It's the beginning of the end.
- Oh, let's hope so.

703
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,406
Still alive then?

704
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:19,787
Here. Sausage. Bread.

705
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:24,083
You still got that vodka?

706
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:41,809
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long, now.

707
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:47,106
- I think, I've got jaundice.
- You don't want to worry about that.

708
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,693
It just makes you look funny.

709
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:55,031
My grandfather was jilted by his
girl friend when he got jaundice.

710
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:59,410
- Drink up.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

711
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:03,956
- It's been over two weeks. I got...
- Problems. Money.

712
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:09,837
I've got to raise money to buy the food.
I need things to sell,

713
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,049
it's not easy.

714
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,804
Yeah, sell this.

715
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,143
Food's more important than time.

716
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:31,776
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you.
The Allies have landed in France.

717
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:37,281
The Russians'll be here soon.
They'll beat the shit out of the Germans.

718
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:41,327
Any day now.

719
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,456
Wiladek?

720
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,462
Wiladek?

721
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:39,218
I knew it, I knew this would happen.

722
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:43,472
- I'm going to get a doctor.
- You can't, it's too dangerous.

723
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:47,643
- I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
- Don't be ridiculous, he's pediatrician.

724
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:51,397
- He's still a Doctor.
- No, you stay, I'll go.

725
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:29,310
We came to say goodbye.

726
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:33,522
We're going to stay with my mother
in Otwocks. The baby's already there.

727
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:40,363
It's safer. There's talk that
the uprising will begin any day now.

728
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,867
That man Szalas should be shot.

729
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:49,872
He's been collecting money on
your behalf all over Warsaw.

730
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:53,209
Apparently, people gave generously.

731
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:56,462
So he collected a tidy sum.

732
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:02,176
My God.

733
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:10,768
Liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder.

734
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:13,979
But he'll live.

735
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:20,444
I'll try to get him some levulose,
but it's not easy.

736
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:24,365
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows?

737
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:29,662
- Doctor. Thank you.
- Don't speak. Rest.

738
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:35,626
Thank you very much for coming

739
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:40,463
I've brought you some food.
I'll prepare something now for you,

740
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,592
then we must go.

741
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:27,094
Away from the window!

742
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:35,936
Watch out, away from the door!

743
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:47,072
Get your ass down!

744
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:57,875
To the pharmacy! Go on!

745
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,566
Just get out! Everywhere!

746
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:52,615
The Germans have surrounded the building!
Get out into the street!

747
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:36,951
Help, Help me. Someone, somebody,
somebody, help me!

748
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:40,973
Fischke, go to the 4th floor!

749
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:45,477
I'm there. There's no one.

750
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:50,149
Go on. Check the attic.

751
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,656
I'm checking the attic.

752
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,493
No one to see over here.

753
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:09,126
- Then come down!
- Yeah, come down!

754
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:45,360
- Any news from your mother?
- Nothing since three weeks.

755
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:50,115
If she were in trouble,
you would know it.

756
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:55,579
But how? I'm in worrying about her.

757
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:01,793
Don't worry.

758
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:56,138
As I said repeatedly: this side first!

759
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:59,267
Just like this.

760
01:55:00,936 --> 01:55:06,691
Just let them step away
before shooting, asshole.

761
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,248
Good, now the hospital!

762
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,599
What, here? Are you sure?

763
01:58:41,239 --> 01:58:46,244
- You mean, that's the hut?
- It has to be the right one.

764
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:55,920
But it's totally destroyed.

765
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:01,231
Who the hell are you?

766
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:08,112
Who are you?

767
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:14,577
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

768
02:02:17,121 --> 02:02:20,250
What are you doing here?

769
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,257
I was...

770
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:31,594
I was trying to open this tin.
- Where do you live?

771
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:39,227
- Do you work here?
- No.

772
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:46,901
What's your work?

773
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:52,532
I am...

774
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:55,910
I was a pianist.

775
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,748
A pianist.

776
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:21,936
Come.

777
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,838
Play.

778
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:10,409
Are you hiding here?

779
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:17,917
Jew?

780
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:22,338
Where are you hiding?

781
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:26,676
In the attic.

782
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:31,889
Show me.

783
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:57,581
Have you anything to eat?

784
02:10:55,306 --> 02:10:58,434
Achtung!

785
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:10,423
Jew?

786
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:27,898
Please. What's all that gunfire?

787
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:31,444
The Russians.
On the other side of the river.

788
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:36,574
All you have to do is hang on
for a few more weeks.

789
02:14:07,164 --> 02:14:10,292
- What's happening?
- We're getting out.

790
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,048
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

791
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:22,846
...I don't know how to thank you.

792
02:14:24,473 --> 02:14:28,978
Don't thank me. Thank God.
It's His will that we should survive.

793
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:32,731
Well. That's what we have to believe.

794
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:45,744
Here, take this one.

795
02:14:46,912 --> 02:14:50,708
- What about you?
- I've got another one. Warmer.

796
02:14:55,754 --> 02:15:00,843
What will you do when it's all over?

797
02:15:01,427 --> 02:15:06,098
I'll play the piano again.
On Polish Radio.

798
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:11,145
Tell me your name.
I'll listen out for you.

799
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:13,439
Szpilman.

800
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,650
Szpilman...

801
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:20,738
Good name for a pianist.

802
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:45,447
German! German!

803
02:17:06,552 --> 02:17:08,595
No.

804
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:11,724
Don't shoot. I'm Polish!

805
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:14,852
Please! I'm Polish! I'm...

806
02:17:14,935 --> 02:17:19,022
- Come out with your hands up.
- Please, I beg you. Don't shoot!

807
02:17:19,106 --> 02:17:23,193
Don't shoot, don't shoot, I beg you.
I'm Polish! I'm Polish, please.

808
02:17:23,277 --> 02:17:26,405
Come down!

809
02:17:29,241 --> 02:17:32,369
Please, I'm Polish! Please, please...

810
02:17:32,661 --> 02:17:35,789
- He's Polish.
- Yes, I'm Polish.

811
02:17:41,754 --> 02:17:44,882
Why the fucking coat?

812
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:47,426
I'm cold.

813
02:18:06,445 --> 02:18:10,032
Look at them. German fuckers.

814
02:18:10,324 --> 02:18:13,452
Murderers! Murderers!

815
02:18:13,577 --> 02:18:17,247
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

816
02:18:18,248 --> 02:18:22,336
Look at you now!
You took everything I had.

817
02:18:22,419 --> 02:18:26,340
Me, a musician! You took my violin!

818
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,718
You took my soul!

819
02:18:32,846 --> 02:18:35,474
Musician?

820
02:18:35,557 --> 02:18:38,602
- You're a musician?
- Yes.

821
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:42,773
Do you happen to know another musician,
a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!

822
02:18:42,856 --> 02:18:46,527
- Polish radio?
- Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.

823
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:50,697
I helped Mr Szpilman
when he was in hiding.

824
02:18:50,781 --> 02:18:56,036
Tell him I'm here.

825
02:18:56,411 --> 02:19:00,290
- Ask him to help me.
- What's your name?

826
02:19:00,582 --> 02:19:03,710
- Hosenfeld.
- What?

827
02:20:44,978 --> 02:20:48,482
It was here, I'm certain of it.

828
02:20:48,815 --> 02:20:51,860
It's not here now.

829
02:20:51,944 --> 02:20:56,031
I shouted abuse at them,
I'm not proud of it,

830
02:20:56,114 --> 02:21:00,202
and, I'm certain, I stood where you now,
there was barbed wire,

831
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:05,749
and this German came up to me.
- You didn't catch his name.

832
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:08,961
No,

833
02:21:09,836 --> 02:21:13,924
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.

834
02:22:16,987 --> 02:22:21,658
Wiladyslaw Szpilman continued to live in
Warsaw until his death on 6th July, 2000.

835
02:22:21,742 --> 02:22:24,870
He was 88 years old.

836
02:22:32,669 --> 02:22:36,798
The name of the German officer
was Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.

837
02:22:36,882 --> 02:22:41,553
All that is known is that he died
1952 in a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp.

838
