1
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,899
Spain, 1944

2
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,987
The Civil War is over.

3
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,030
Hidden in the mountains

4
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,118
armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.

5
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,020
A long time ago,

6
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,149
in the Underground Realm,

7
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,319
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,698
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,785
She dreamt of blue skies

10
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,414
soft breeze and sunshine.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,879
One day,

12
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,467
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

13
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,766
Once outside,
the bright sun blinded her

14
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,312
and erased her memory.

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,234
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

16
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,780
Her body suffered cold,
sickness and pain.

17
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,866
And eventually she died.

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,453
However, her father, the king,

19
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,998
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

20
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,084
perhaps in another body,

21
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,878
in another place, at another time.

22
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,840
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

23
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,552
until the world stopped turning.

24
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,730
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

25
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,692
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

26
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,074
Fairy tales?

27
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,118
You're a bit too old

28
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,578
to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

29
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,125
Ask him to stop the car.

30
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,225
Ofelia, wait.

31
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,728
Your brother's not well.

32
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,857
Madam, are you okay?

33
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,610
Madam, do you need anything?

34
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,239
It's nothing.
Just give me a little water.

35
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,409
Water. Water for the Captain's wife.

36
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,675
Ofelia?

37
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,139
Come here.

38
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,726
I saw a fairy.

39
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,895
Just look at your shoes.

40
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,314
Let's go.

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,318
When we get there,
come out to greet the Captain.

42
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,654
I want you to call him Father.

43
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,532
You hear? "Father."

44
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,620
It's just a word, Ofelia.
Just a word.

45
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,355
They're coming, Captain.

46
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,858
Fifteen minutes late.

47
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,294
Carmen.

48
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,052
Welcome.

49
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,226
Please don't,
I can walk perfectly well.

50
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,187
The doctor says
you must not exert yourself.

51
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,398
No.

52
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,109
Come.

53
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,736
Do it for me.

54
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,451
Thank you.

55
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,704
Ofelia, come out.

56
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,748
Say hello to the Captain.

57
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,629
Ofelia.

58
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,347
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

59
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,269
Mercedes!

60
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,606
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

61
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,214
It's a labyrinth.

62
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,388
A pile of old rocks
that's always been here.

63
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,099
Even before the mill.

64
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,185
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

65
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,271
Thank you.

66
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,106
Have you read them all?

67
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,524
Mercedes!

68
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,028
The Captain is calling.

69
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,573
Your father needs me.

70
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,910
He's not my father.

71
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,829
The Captain is not my father.

72
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,207
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

73
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,668
He's not my father.

74
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,172
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

75
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,340
Have you seen my mother?

76
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,259
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yes.

77
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,928
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

78
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,698
The guerrillas are deep
in the woods.

79
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,575
It's hard to track them.

80
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,204
The scum know the terrain
better than us.

81
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,081
We'll block their access.

82
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:47,212
Food, medicine,
everything will be stored right here.

83
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,963
They'll come to us.

84
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,885
We'll set up three new command posts.
Here, here and here.

85
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,637
Mercedes.

86
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,389
Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.

87
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,642
Yes, sir.

88
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,106
This will help you sleep.

89
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,026
Just two drops just before bed.

90
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,656
Two drops only.

91
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,951
Very good.

92
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,912
All of it.

93
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,539
Good.

94
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't hesitate to call me.
Day or night.

95
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,133
You or your nurse.

96
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,093
Good night.

97
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,179
Close the door
and turn off the lights.

98
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,152
You have to go up
and see him there.

99
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,946
The leg wound is getting worse.

100
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,704
This is all I could get.
I'm sorry.

101
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,833
Captain Vidal is waiting in his office.

102
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,194
Come here, Ofelia.

103
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,209
Jesus, your feet. They're frozen!

104
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,720
Are you afraid?

105
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,723
A little.

106
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,729
What's that noise?

107
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,149
Nothing, just the wind.

108
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,737
Nights here are different
from city nights.

109
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,116
There, you hear cars, trains.

110
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,577
Here the houses are old.

111
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,413
They creak.

112
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,251
As if they were speaking.

113
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,548
Tomorrow I'll give you a surprise.

114
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,550
- A surprise?
- Yes.

115
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,596
A book?

116
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,641
No, something much better.

117
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,856
Why did you have to get married?

118
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,488
I was alone too long.

119
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,075
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

120
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,828
You were never alone.

121
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,084
When you're older, you'll understand.
It's been hard for me too.

122
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,464
Your brother's acting up.

123
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,509
Tell him one of your stories.

124
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm sure that'll calm him down.

125
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,099
My brother...

126
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,692
Many, many years ago,

127
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,278
in a sad, faraway land,

128
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,198
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

129
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,993
At sunset,

130
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,454
on top of that mountain,

131
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,208
a magic rose blossomed that would make
whoever plucked it immortal.

132
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,171
But no one dared go near it

133
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,674
because its thorns were full of poison.

134
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,810
Men talked amongst themselves

135
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,647
about their fear of death and pain,

136
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,193
but never about the promise
of eternal life.

137
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,950
And every day, the rose wilted,

138
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,913
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

139
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,836
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

140
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,757
forever alone, until the end of time.

141
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,562
Come in.

142
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,109
- How is she?
- Very weak.

143
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,735
She'll have rest.

144
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,071
I'll sleep down here.

145
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,993
And my son?

146
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,287
Excuse us, Captain.

147
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,333
My son, how is he?

148
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,545
There's no reason to be alarmed.

149
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,756
Very good.

150
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,885
Captain, your wife
should not have traveled

151
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,388
at such a late stage of pregnancy.

152
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,725
Is that your opinion?

153
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,186
My professional opinion, yes, sir.

154
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,817
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

155
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,527
That's all.

156
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,197
One more thing, Captain.

157
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,451
What makes you so sure the baby
is a male?

158
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,745
Don't fuck with me.

159
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,500
At 3 p.m., we detected movement
in the northwest sector.

160
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,127
Gunfire.

161
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,133
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

162
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,343
The other one's his son.

163
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,888
Captain, my father is an honorable man.

164
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,391
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

165
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,769
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

166
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,315
- My father was hunting rabbits.
- Again, keep quiet.

167
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,785
"No God, no country, no master"?

168
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,787
How do you like that?

169
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,081
Red propaganda, Captain.

170
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,708
It's not propaganda, sir.

171
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,920
It's an old almanac, Captain.

172
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,839
We're just farmers.

173
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,675
Go on.

174
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,263
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

175
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,933
For my daughters. They're sick.

176
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,478
Rabbits?

177
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,815
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

178
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
Leave him alone.

179
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,291
You killed him!

180
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,796
Murderer! Son of a bitch!

181
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,078
Search these assholes properly

182
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,871
before you come bothering me.

183
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,623
Yes, Captain.

184
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,103
Mother.

185
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,230
Mother, wake up.

186
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,775
Mother, there's something in the room.

187
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,984
Hello.

188
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,904
Did you follow me here?

189
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,530
Are you a fairy?

190
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,076
Look!

191
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,832
This is a fairy.

192
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,445
You want me to go with you?

193
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,739
Outside?

194
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,491
Where?

195
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,570
Hello?

196
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,301
Echo.

197
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,407
It's you?

198
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,791
It's you. You've returned.

199
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,001
Don't be frightened, I beg you.

200
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,420
Look.

201
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,557
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

202
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,225
Me?

203
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,146
I've had so many names.

204
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,067
Old names that only the wind

205
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:44,029
and the trees can pronounce.

206
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,032
I am the mountain,

207
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:51,328
the forest and the earth.

208
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,831
I am...

209
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,670
I am a faun.

210
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,508
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

211
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,926
No, I'm...

212
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:11,181
You're Princess Moanna,
daughter of the king

213
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,934
of the underworld.

214
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,477
My father was a tailor.

215
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,063
You are not born of man.

216
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,234
It was the moon that bore you.

217
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,486
Look on your left shoulder

218
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,656
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

219
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,617
All over the world

220
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,871
your real father had us open portals

221
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,750
to allow your return.

222
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,210
This is...

223
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,380
the last of them.

224
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:49,428
But we have to make sure

225
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,556
that your essence is intact,

226
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,685
that you have not become a mortal.

227
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,525
You must complete three tasks

228
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,528
before the moon is full.

229
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,620
This is The Book of Crossroads.

230
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,874
Open it when you are alone

231
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,670
and it will show you your future,

232
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:27,049
show you what must be done.

233
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,975
But there's nothing...

234
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,535
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

235
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,121
They are too young.

236
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,834
See if they'll do for a stew.

237
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,880
This coffee was burnt.

238
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,007
Taste it yourself.

239
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,350
You should keep an eye on it.

240
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,103
As you wish, sir.

241
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,445
Cook these.

242
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,990
- He hated the coffee.
- He's so damn fussy!

243
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,160
- A fussy dandy!
- We need more beef and chicken.

244
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,037
Where will we find it?

245
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,372
The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

246
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,917
They eat more
than a couple of pigs.

247
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,420
And they don't shut up.

248
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,922
Not even underwater.

249
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,439
I'll be back in a moment.

250
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,113
Ofelia.

251
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,076
Your father is giving
a dinner tonight.

252
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,162
Look what I've made for you.

253
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,040
Do you like it?

254
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,545
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

255
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,421
And look at these shoes!

256
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,676
Do you like them?

257
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,845
Yes, very pretty.

258
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,265
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

259
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,378
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

260
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,797
You must look lovely
for the Captain.

261
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,886
You'll look like a princess.

262
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,392
A princess?

263
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,858
Clean those chickens properly.

264
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,569
And don't forget the beans.

265
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,785
You look marvelous,
my girl, just beautiful.

266
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,123
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

267
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,336
Do you want some milk?

268
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,177
Move back,
don't get your dress dirty.

269
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,429
You look so pretty.

270
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,935
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

271
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,688
No.

272
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:37,567
When I was little, I did.
I believed in a lot of things.

273
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,697
Last night, a fairy visited me.

274
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,156
Really?

275
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,244
Yes, and there were
three of them.

276
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,329
- And a faun too.
- A faun?

277
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,666
He was very old, very tall,

278
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,334
and smelled like earth.

279
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,838
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

280
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,423
Mercedes!

281
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,800
Come with me.

282
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,146
Captain, everything is here.

283
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,775
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

284
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,944
olives, bacon.

285
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,030
Tobacco.

286
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,574
And the ration cards.

287
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,328
- You must check the inventory.
- Very well.

288
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,418
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,719
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

290
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,346
From now on, I'll carry it.

291
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,639
Captain.

292
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,147
Captain, perhaps it's nothing.

293
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,156
It's them.

294
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,127
"Once upon a time,

295
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,005
when the forest was young,

296
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,591
it was home to creatures

297
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,637
who were full of magic and wonder.

298
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,104
They protected one another

299
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,649
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

300
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,318
that grew on a hill, near the mill.

301
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,739
But now, the tree is dying.

302
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:52,244
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

303
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,705
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

304
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,791
and won't let the tree thrive.

305
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,295
Force the magic stones
into the toad's mouth

306
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,047
and take the golden key

307
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,299
from inside its belly.

308
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,178
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

309
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,058
They were here only minutes ago.

310
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,685
They left in a hurry.

311
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,028
A dozen men, at most.

312
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,840
Antibiotics.

313
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,719
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

314
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,056
They're here.

315
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,894
Those sons of bitches are here,

316
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,063
and they're watching us.

317
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,080
You left this behind!

318
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,624
And your lottery ticket!

319
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,377
Why don't you come back
and get it?

320
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,838
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

321
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm Princess Moanna,

322
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,499
and I'm not afraid of you.

323
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,546
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

324
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,717
eating all these bugs,

325
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,761
growing fat while the tree dies.

326
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,509
Have you checked in the pantry?

327
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,640
And the garden?

328
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,350
The barn?

329
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,144
Where has she run off to?

330
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,521
This way, please.

331
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,109
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

332
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,821
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

333
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,783
From now on,
one ration card per family.

334
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,159
Take a look.

335
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,537
- One?
- Only one.

336
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,206
I'm not sure it'll be enough.

337
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,708
If people are careful...

338
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,086
We can't allow anyone
to send food to the guerillas.

339
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,423
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

340
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,302
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

341
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,095
We almost got them.

342
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,390
We found this. Antibiotics.

343
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,476
God has already taken care
of their souls.

344
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,730
Their bodies hardly matter to Him.

345
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,982
We'll help however we can, Captain.

346
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,277
We know you're not here by choice.

347
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,407
You're wrong about that.

348
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,579
I want my son to be born
in a new, cleansed Spain.

349
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,207
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

350
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,543
that we're all equal.

351
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,545
But there's a big difference:

352
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,548
The war is over and we won.

353
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,260
And if we need to kill
every one of them,

354
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,722
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

355
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,183
We're all here by choice.

356
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,185
By choice!

357
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,775
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

358
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,735
We'll take care of it.

359
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,736
How did you and the Captain meet?

360
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,950
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

361
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,451
I see.

362
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,872
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

363
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,792
A little more than a year ago,

364
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,377
the Captain and I

365
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,963
met again.

366
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,673
Curious, isn't it!

367
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,343
I mean, finding each other again?

368
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,139
Yes, very curious.

369
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,851
Please, forgive my wife.
She isn't used to company.

370
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,187
She thinks her silly stories
interest us all.

371
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,069
Excuse me, madam...

372
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,946
Excuse me.

373
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,085
Have I told you
I met your father?

374
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,296
No. I had no idea.

375
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,175
In Morocco.

376
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,344
Briefly, but he left a vivid impression.

377
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,096
An excellent soldier.

378
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:41,601
His men said that when General Vidal died
on the battlefield,

379
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,062
he smashed his watch

380
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,398
so his son would know
the exact hour of his death.

381
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,776
So he'd know
how a brave man dies.

382
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,074
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

383
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,953
What you've done hurts me.

384
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,458
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

385
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,086
Are you listening?

386
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,258
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

387
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,011
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

388
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,598
And your father too.

389
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,643
You mean the Captain?

390
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,020
Him more than me.

391
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,787
I've got the key.

392
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,417
Take me to the Labyrinth.

393
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,388
Hello.

394
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,725
I got the key out.

395
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,476
That's me,

396
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:53,149
- and the girl is you.
- And the baby?

397
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,278
So you retrieved the key.

398
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,073
I'm glad.

399
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,085
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

400
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,964
She's so glad you succeeded.

401
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,388
Keep the key.

402
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,850
You'll be needing it very soon.

403
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,897
And this too. A piece of chalk.

404
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,109
Two tasks remain,

405
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,447
and the moon is almost full.

406
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,242
Be patient.

407
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,786
We'll soon be strolling

408
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:53,084
through the seven circular gardens
of your palace.

409
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,878
Why would I believe you?

410
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,967
Why would a poor little faun like me
lie to you?

411
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,449
Proceed.

412
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,036
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

413
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,913
Let's go.

414
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,540
Your name?

415
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,128
Your names, first and last.

416
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,006
Narciso Peña Soriano,

417
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,757
at your service.

418
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,680
Our daily bread in Franco's Spain,

419
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,099
kept safe in this mill!

420
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,517
The Reds lie

421
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,271
because in a united Spain,

422
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,691
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

423
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,291
Come on,
show me what happens now.

424
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,793
Show me.

425
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,499
Ofelia, help me.

426
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,715
Captain!

427
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,844
Come quickly.

428
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,722
...Because in a united Spain,

429
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,600
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

430
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,019
Our daily bread in Franco's Spain.

431
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,275
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

432
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,072
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

433
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,618
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

434
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,621
I'll stay until the birth.

435
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,457
Make her well.

436
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,585
Whatever it costs,
whatever you need.

437
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,091
Make her well.

438
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,071
Don't worry.

439
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,033
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

440
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,080
Having a baby is complicated.

441
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,959
Then I'll never have one.

442
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,266
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

443
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,654
Have you told anyone?

444
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,324
No, I haven't.

445
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,703
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

446
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,673
Nor I to you.

447
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,676
Do you know a lullaby?

448
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,514
Only one,

449
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,475
but I don't remember the words.

450
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,354
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

451
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,492
Don't be afraid.

452
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,286
It's only me.

453
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,919
Are you ready?

454
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,715
Then let's go.

455
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,471
This is sheer madness.

456
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,224
When he finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

457
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,892
Have you thought about that?

458
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,894
Are you so afraid of him, doctor?

459
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,688
It's not fear.

460
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,441
At least not for myself.

461
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,995
Pedro.

462
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,540
My brother.

463
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,600
You didn't carry out the task.

464
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,479
No, my mother is sick.

465
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,107
That's no excuse for negligence.

466
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:37,196
Look. This is a mandrake root.

467
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,114
A plant that dreamt

468
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,241
of being human.

469
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,413
Put it under your mother's bed

470
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,875
in a bowl of fresh milk.

471
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,462
Each morning, give it

472
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,256
two drops of blood.

473
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,966
Now,

474
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,011
we have no time to waste.

475
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,139
The full moon will be upon us.

476
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,936
Take my pets
to guide you through.

477
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,729
You're going

478
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,023
to a very dangerous place,

479
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,817
so be careful.

480
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,861
The thing that slumbers there,

481
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,198
it is not human.

482
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,165
You will see a sumptuous feast,

483
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,168
but don't eat or drink anything.

484
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,506
Absolutely nothing.

485
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:42,261
Your life depends on it.

486
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:08,287
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

487
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,831
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

488
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,210
Let's see how that leg's doing.

489
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:19,214
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

490
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,008
Let's see.

491
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,306
"N-North American,

492
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,268
British and Canadian troops

493
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:35,606
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F..."

494
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,816
- "France," idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

495
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,737
"More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope

496
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:46,158
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower..."

497
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,453
Is it really bad, doctor?

498
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,206
Look, Frenchie.

499
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,584
There's no way to save it.

500
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,681
I'll do as few cuts as possible.

501
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,192
Wait a second, doctor.

502
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,194
Just a second.

503
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,522
"Use the chalk

504
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,693
to trace a door
anywhere in your room.

505
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,242
Once the door's open,

506
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,411
start the hourglass.

507
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,707
Let the fairies guide you.

508
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,215
Don't eat or drink anything,

509
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:30,262
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

510
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,855
This one.

511
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,589
We'll soon have reinforcements.

512
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,466
Fifty men or more.

513
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:44,177
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

514
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,514
And then what?

515
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,851
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another.

516
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,604
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter.

517
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,983
You need food, medicine.

518
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,818
You must take care of Mercedes.

519
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,486
If you love her, take her away.

520
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:02,946
This is a lost cause.

521
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,782
I'm staying, doctor. That's it.

522
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,212
You have to leave.

523
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,633
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

524
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,177
It's exactly what he expects.

525
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,807
Leave it to me.

526
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,937
I'm a coward.

527
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,733
No, you're not.

528
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,484
Yes, I am.

529
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,154
A coward

530
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,198
for living next to
that son of a bitch,

531
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,286
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

532
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,833
What if the doctor's right?

533
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,341
We'll have made it harder
for that bastard.

534
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,761
Left march!

535
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,956
Captain Vidal...

536
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,127
I don't understand,
her temperature's down.

537
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,588
But she still has a fever?

538
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,965
It's a good sign.
Her body's fighting.

539
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,510
Listen to me.

540
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,430
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

541
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,516
That boy will bear my name,
my father's name.

542
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,351
Save him.

543
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,055
Brother...

544
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,016
Little brother...

545
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,353
If you can hear me,

546
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,898
things out here aren't too good.

547
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,944
But soon you'll have to come out.

548
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,863
You've made Mama very sick.

549
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,661
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

550
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,704
just one:

551
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,541
Don't hurt her.

552
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,920
You'll meet her, she's very pretty,

553
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,423
though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

554
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,426
You'll see, when she smiles,

555
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,054
you'll love her.

556
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,935
Listen, if you do what I say,

557
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,770
I'll make you a promise,

558
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:50,525
I'll take you back to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

559
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,237
I promise you, a prince.

560
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,558
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

561
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,977
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

562
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,771
We jumped out just in time,

563
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,690
but look at the mess!

564
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,320
What did they steal?

565
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,030
They took nothing.

566
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,782
What the hell are you saying?

567
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,452
This whole mess...
They didn't take anything.

568
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:46,080
Nothing? Are you sure?

569
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,417
They were just trying
to waste our time.

570
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,562
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

571
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,985
They have grenades,
they're coming from uphill.

572
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,950
We've surrounded one unit
that fell behind.

573
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,119
They took cover up on the hill.

574
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,823
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,

575
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,367
this is the only decent way to die.

576
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,805
Let me see.

577
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,605
Can you talk?

578
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,235
Damn it.

579
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,715
These are useless! They can't talk.

580
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,725
Captain,

581
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,435
this one's still alive.

582
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,816
Shot in the leg.

583
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,823
- What is it?
- They caught one.

584
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,534
They're taking him
to the storeroom.

585
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,665
Mercedes!

586
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,334
Pedro...

587
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,773
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

588
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:41,983
Move away!

589
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,888
That's plenty, dear.

590
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,435
Should I take this up?

591
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,415
Here, half the dose.

592
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,751
I don't think I need it.

593
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,171
I feel better, much better.

594
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,882
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

595
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,819
Damn, this cigarette is good.

596
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:13,157
Good-quality tobacco,
really hard to find.

597
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,536
F-f-fuck you.

598
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:23,668
We catch one,
turns out to be a stutterer.

599
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,379
We'll be here all night.

600
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,297
As long as he talks.

601
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,888
Garces is right.

602
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,141
You'd do better to come clean.

603
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,936
But to make sure it happens,

604
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,896
I brought along a few tools.

605
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,150
Just things you pick up
along the way.

606
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,319
At first, I won't trust you,

607
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,488
but after I use this,

608
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,157
you'll own up to a few things.

609
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,119
When we get to these,

610
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,205
we'll have developed...

611
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,291
how can I put this?
A bond,

612
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,168
almost like brothers.

613
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,045
You'll see.

614
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,633
And when we get to this one,

615
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,595
I'll believe anything you tell me.

616
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,900
I'll make you a deal.

617
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:34,405
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering, you can go.

618
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,286
Don't look at him, look at me.

619
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,371
Above me, there's no one.

620
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,790
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

621
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,627
If I say this asshole can go,
would anybody contradict me?

622
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,796
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

623
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:52,506
There you have it.

624
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,384
Count to three.

625
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,777
One.

626
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,445
Good.

627
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,617
Two.

628
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,288
One more and you will be free.

629
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,264
Too bad.

630
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:57,613
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

631
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:03,911
You must be relieved.

632
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,165
Yes, thank you.

633
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:12,378
But things haven't turned out so well.

634
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,759
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

635
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,010
Yes.

636
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,397
You broke the rules!

637
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,108
Only two grapes!
I thought no one would notice.

638
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,695
We've made a mistake!

639
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,280
A mistake?

640
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,950
You failed. You can never return.

641
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,535
It was an accident!

642
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,996
You cannot return.

643
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:51,000
The moon will be full in three days.

644
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,503
Your spirit shall forever remain

645
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,964
among the humans.

646
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,844
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them,

647
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,806
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

648
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:10,102
And we'll vanish along with it.

649
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:14,315
You will never see us again.

650
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,827
Good day, doctor.

651
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,413
Sorry to wake you so early,

652
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,498
but I think we need your help.

653
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,398
My God, what have you done to him?

654
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,150
Not much.

655
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,612
But things are getting better.

656
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,247
I like having you handy, doctor.

657
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,083
It has its advantages.

658
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,044
Serrano, stay here.

659
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,587
I talked.

660
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,756
Not much.

661
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,969
B-b-but I talked.

662
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,973
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

663
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,814
Kill me.

664
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:41,110
Kill me now, please.

665
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,877
Son of a bitch.

666
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,151
It'll take away the pain.

667
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,992
It's almost over.

668
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,502
Keep an eye on the doctor,
I'll be a minute.

669
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,837
Yes, Captain.

670
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,820
You're not moving anymore.

671
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,323
Are you sick?

672
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,162
What are you doing down there?

673
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,677
- Call him!
- Who?

674
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,305
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

675
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,914
What the hell is this?

676
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:07,047
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

677
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,927
Look what she was hiding
under your bed!

678
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,221
What do you think of this?

679
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,105
What is this thing doing
under the bed?

680
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,023
It's a magic root

681
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,067
the faun gave me.

682
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,820
It's all that junk
that you let her read.

683
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,196
Look what you've done!

684
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:34,908
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

685
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,578
Fine.

686
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,037
As you wish.

687
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:43,834
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

688
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,670
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

689
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,590
You have to stop all this.

690
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,426
I want to leave this place!

691
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,345
Please, take me away from here!
Please!

692
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,265
Things are not that simple.

693
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:01,977
You're getting older,

694
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,356
you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

695
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,318
The world is a cruel place.

696
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:11,987
And you'll learn that,

697
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,282
even if it hurts.

698
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,914
Magic does not exist.

699
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,083
Not for you, me or anyone else.

700
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,971
Mom!

701
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,806
Help!

702
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,350
Help!

703
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,108
Why did you do it?

704
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,530
It was the only thing I could do.

705
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,866
No. You could have obeyed me.

706
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,870
I could have, but I didn't.

707
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,375
It would have been better for you.

708
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,879
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

709
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:14,174
To obey, like that,
for the sake of obeying,

710
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,843
without questioning.

711
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,890
Only people like you
can do that, Captain.

712
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,304
Captain!

713
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,355
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.
Get up immediately!

714
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,149
Yes, Captain.

715
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,477
Your wife is dead.

716
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,239
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

717
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,034
And the essence
of His forgiveness

718
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,162
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

719
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,208
Because although God
sends us the message,

720
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,002
it is our task to decipher it.

721
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,797
Because when we open our arms

722
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:21,677
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

723
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,931
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

724
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,519
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

725
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,147
And the state of grace
that we lose at our birth.

726
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:40,362
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

727
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:47,327
And because only
in His physical absence

728
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:51,790
is the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

729
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,939
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,

730
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,899
didn't you, Mercedes?

731
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,153
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

732
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:26,658
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here, at the mill.

733
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:31,455
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

734
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:36,668
Mercedes, please.

735
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,180
What must you think of me?

736
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,391
That I'm some kind of a monster.

737
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,519
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

738
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,574
Go to the storeroom
and bring me more liquor.

739
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,535
Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir.

740
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,874
Forgetting something?

741
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,834
Sir?

742
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,507
The key.

743
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,843
I do have the only copy, don't I?

744
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,346
Yes, sir.

745
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,768
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

746
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,978
Maybe it's not important, but...

747
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:38,814
When they broke into the storeroom,

748
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,650
with all those grenades
and explosives,

749
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,069
the lock itself wasn't forced.

750
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,157
As I said, it's probably not important.

751
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,955
Be very careful.

752
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,416
Good night, sir.

753
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,463
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

754
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,382
Where to?

755
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,676
I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

756
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:52,012
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

757
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,099
I can't, my child.
But I'll come back for you, I promise.

758
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,601
Take me with you.

759
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,668
I heard something.

760
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:31,593
It's nothing, don't worry.

761
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:42,437
Mercedes.

762
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,649
Ofelia.

763
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,825
How long have you known?

764
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,375
How long have you been
mocking me?

765
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,960
Little bitch!

766
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,128
Watch her!

767
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,133
And if anyone tries to get in,

768
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:14,719
kill her first.

769
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,527
Dry meat.

770
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,489
Tobacco.

771
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,952
Had you asked,
I would have given this to you.

772
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,253
I want the names
contained in them.

773
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:52,215
I want them in front of me
tomorrow.

774
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:53,758
Yes, Captain.

775
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:57,846
You can go, Garces.

776
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,182
You're sure, Captain?

777
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,396
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

778
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,360
That's what you've always thought.

779
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,405
That's how I got away with it.

780
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,533
I was invisible to you.

781
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:20,577
Damn.

782
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:25,582
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

783
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:30,378
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

784
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,341
It's very simple: you will talk.

785
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,178
And I have to know

786
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,890
that it's true.

787
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:45,060
We have a few things here

788
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,021
strictly for that purpose.

789
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,565
Nothing complicated.

790
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,569
Things we learn on the job.

791
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:59,365
At first...

792
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,719
I'm not some old man.
Not a wounded prisoner.

793
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,931
Motherfucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl.

794
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,558
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

795
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:50,208
Look! He let her go.

796
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,670
The fuck did you say?

797
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,012
Get her!

798
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:04,806
Come on! Bring her to me!

799
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,141
Bring her to me, damn!

800
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:08,518
Mount up!

801
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:14,250
It'll be better if you come
without struggling.

802
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,836
The Captain said that if you behave...

803
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,884
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

804
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,136
If anyone's going to kill you...

805
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,223
I rather it'd be me.

806
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,712
I've decided to give you

807
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,797
one last chance.

808
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:50,680
Do you promise to do what I say?

809
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:55,143
Will you do everything I tell you,

810
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,936
without question?

811
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,441
This is your last chance.

812
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:05,611
Then listen to me.

813
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:08,531
Fetch your brother

814
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,451
and bring him to the labyrinth,

815
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:15,830
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

816
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,457
My brother?

817
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,042
We need him.

818
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,295
- But...
- No more questions.

819
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:27,008
The door's locked.

820
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,135
In that case,

821
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:32,513
create your own door.

822
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:24,143
Captain, with your permission.

823
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,314
Come quickly.

824
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:30,525
Now what?

825
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,652
Serrano is back. He's wounded.

826
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:34,445
Wounded?

827
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:22,118
Where's Garces?

828
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,168
How many were there?

829
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:33,462
I don't know exactly, Captain.

830
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:35,339
Fifty men, at least.

831
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:37,258
The others didn't make it.

832
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,051
Our watch posts
are not responding.

833
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,886
How many men do we have left?

834
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,139
Twenty, maybe less, sir.

835
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,067
We're leaving.

836
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,320
Together.

837
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,447
Don't be afraid.

838
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:01,907
Nothing will happen to you.

839
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:09,832
Safeguard the perimeter.

840
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:12,376
If the rest of the squad gets back,

841
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:15,921
report immediately to me.
Radio for reinforcements, now.

842
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,882
Yes, Captain.

843
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:45,785
Leave him!

844
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:32,915
Ofelia!

845
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:02,463
Quickly, Your Majesty,

846
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,007
give him to me.

847
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,011
The full moon is high in the sky,

848
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,597
we can open the portal.

849
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:14,725
Why is that in your hand?

850
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,687
The portal will only open

851
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:21,315
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

852
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:25,569
Just a drop of blood, that's all.

853
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:29,323
It's the final task. Hurry.

854
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,830
You promised to obey me!

855
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,290
- Give me the boy!
- No!

856
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:41,252
My brother stays with me.

857
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,548
You would give up your sacred rights

858
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,424
for this brat you barely know?

859
01:45:47,633 --> 01:45:50,094
Yes, I would.

860
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,098
You would give up
your throne for him?

861
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:58,686
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

862
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:01,897
Yes, I would.

863
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:11,490
As you wish, Your Highness.

864
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:28,799
No!

865
01:47:27,358 --> 01:47:28,525
My son.

866
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:57,471
Tell my son...

867
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:06,146
Tell him what time his father died.

868
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,065
- Tell him that I...
- No.

869
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:10,651
He won't even know your name.

870
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:55,255
Arise, my daughter.

871
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:00,094
Come.

872
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:27,830
Father.

873
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:31,875
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

874
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:36,088
That was the final task,
and the most important.

875
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:49,351
And you chose well,

876
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:52,938
Your Highness.

877
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:54,648
Come here with me,

878
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:57,067
and sit by your father's side.

879
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:59,987
He's been waiting for you so long.

880
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:56,335
It is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

881
01:51:57,377 --> 01:52:00,756
That she reigned there
with justice and a kind heart

882
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:02,799
for many centuries.

883
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,886
That she was loved by her people.

884
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,180
And that she left behind

885
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:11,058
small traces of her time on earth,

886
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:14,311
visible only to those

887
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:16,230
who know where to look.
