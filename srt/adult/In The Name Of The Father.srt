1
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,010
Hello, hello? Good.

2
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,971
I never said thank you
for taking up our case.

3
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,223
Never thought I'd trust
an English person again,

4
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,100
especially a lawyer.

5
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,728
Anyhow, I'll be as brief
and accurate as I can

6
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:16,730
with names, dates, and places,

7
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:19,566
anything that might help
in our defense.

8
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:22,527
To explain how I happened
to be in England in 1974

9
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,071
at the time of the bombing,

10
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,324
I better take you back to Northern
Ireland, where I come from.

11
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,119
See, Belfast in the early
'70s was total chaos.

12
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,455
It was strange to see
soldiers on the street,

13
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,166
all of them terrified
of the civilian population,

14
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,335
any one of whom
could be an IRA gunman.

15
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,507
I was just a petty thief,
stealing scrap metal.

16
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,010
In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.

17
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,514
Get down, Gerry, for fuck's sake.

18
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,390
Tommo!

19
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,268
The IRA had already given
me three warnings,

20
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:57,813
and when a British patrol
mistook me for a gunman,

21
00:03:57,897 --> 00:03:59,022
that got me into real trouble.

22
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,774
Is he trying to fucking shoot us!

23
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,910
There's a sniper. There's a sniper!
He's up there!

24
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:15,956
I can't get a bead on him.

25
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,125
Shoot him before he fucking kills us!

26
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,767
Fucking bastards!

27
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,444
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr. Kelly, love.

28
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:50,407
Two suspects proceeding back west...

29
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:54,411
Mr. Kelly!

30
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,037
Murderers!

31
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,414
Okay, we're gonna have
to move the guns.

32
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,166
You go and move
the gear, eh? Hurry up.

33
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,293
Right, everyone out now!
Come on!

34
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,671
Get out of the fucking way!
The Brits is after us.

35
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,551
The Brits is after us!

36
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:10,844
The Brits are after us!

37
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,971
In here! In here!
Gerry!

38
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,766
Come on, come on.
This way, lads.

39
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,478
Go! Go! Go! Go!

40
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,545
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

41
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:50,133
They're right in front of us, boys.

42
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:54,971
Who is it?
It's Conlon.

43
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,139
Grab him.

44
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,701
It's your brother, your brother Gerry.

45
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,455
Oh, my God!

46
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,010
Get the women out of there!

47
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,349
Fucking English bastards!

48
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,563
They've started a riot
to cover the sniper.

49
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,274
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him.

50
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,525
Let's go, lads.

51
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,321
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

52
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,284
Get that blasted child out of here!

53
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,244
Get that child out of here now!

54
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,328
Let's move.
Come on, lads.

55
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,414
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go! Go!

56
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:03,957
Move that child!

57
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:14,217
Shoot that fucking gas now!

58
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,853
Come and fucking get us now,
you bastards!

59
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,738
Let him go, you bastards!

60
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,365
Fucking bitch!

61
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:53,173
You okay?

62
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:54,716
I got a friend wants to talk to you.

63
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,301
Oh, fuck's sake!
Come on. We can do this

64
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,053
the easy way or
the hard way, all right?

65
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,138
Let's be smart.
Come on.

66
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,018
They're taking your brother away!

67
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:07,812
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

68
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,022
We weren't robbing no houses.

69
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,857
Don't fuck with me.
Suddenly you're a good boy?

70
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,776
Have you been robbing
people's houses again?

71
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,860
We weren't robbing houses!

72
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,488
Search him.
Did you get away all right?

73
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,615
Aye.
Who was it?

74
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:20,700
Those two?

75
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:21,910
That isn't mine!

76
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:23,119
Peter.
It isn't.

77
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:26,122
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

78
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,290
Fuck you!

79
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,127
Daddy! Daddy!

80
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,796
The IRA has our Gerry.

81
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,716
Go on, show me.

82
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,635
Yo, give him that.

83
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,012
Right, come on, lads.

84
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,898
Right, Tommo, get the trousers down.

85
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:54,067
I fucking warned you, Danny.

86
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:55,819
We didn't do nothing, honestly.

87
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:57,654
Give you a break?
What's she saying about us?

88
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,822
What are we supposed to have done?

89
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,906
This is what I'm gonna give you.

90
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,949
Now, get your trousers down.

91
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,243
You just ran into a house
where we had all that gear,

92
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,327
and we've almost lost it.

93
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,579
What was I supposed to know?
I was just trying to get away from the Brits.

94
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:08,248
'Cause you were stealing
lead again, weren't you?

95
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,417
You were stealing lead.
Shut up!

96
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,043
They were shooting at us.
Shut up.

97
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:13,795
Get the strides down now.
Why?

98
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,921
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound

99
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,257
and lose your leg, that's why.

100
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,175
Come on, Peter.
Give us a few slaps.

101
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,718
You don't have to shoot us.
Fuck's sake.

102
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,095
Fucking Tarzan.

103
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,680
Look at the balls on him!

104
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,766
Jesus Christ!

105
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,893
Peter! Peter!

106
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:31,354
They're only young.
Give them a chance.

107
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,315
We were just trying to scare
some sense into them.

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,650
He was stealing lead again.

109
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,611
He ran through one of our houses
and started all this shit.

110
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:39,821
Did you start all this?

111
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,701
Here, he'll never survive
in this town. Never.

112
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,952
This is the last time.

113
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,120
You two blow.

114
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,288
And, Danny, it's the last time.

115
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,123
The same for you, Conlon.
Let's go, lads.

116
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,749
Come back here.

117
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,461
We've never had a thief in our family.

118
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:56,629
We've had nothing in our family.

119
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:57,839
Will you get a job?

120
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:00,925
We can't get jobs.
You know we can't get jobs.

121
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,011
I have a job.

122
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,181
You want me to work
as a bookie's clerk?

123
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,141
I want you to have some respect.

124
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,101
Aye, respect for who?

125
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,520
For yourself.

126
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,907
We're getting you out of here.

127
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,078
He'll do no growing up
in England, Guiseppe.

128
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,164
No family life there.

129
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,332
Give over, Ma.

130
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,668
I'm going to miss the boat.

131
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,795
What's that?
Sausages for your Aunt Annie.

132
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,047
Jesus Christ, Ma.

133
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,173
Here you are, son.

134
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,383
Here, let me do that.

135
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,931
All right, I'm ready.
Where are you going?

136
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,182
I'll walk with you.

137
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:50,975
Do you not trust me
to get on the boat?

138
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,604
I'm sure I'll be back when
I'm a millionaire, Gran.

139
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,439
Good luck.
God bless.

140
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,191
I love you, son.

141
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,109
Cheerio, Gerry.

142
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,528
Behave yourself, Ann.

143
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:02,695
Cheerio, Gerry.

144
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,155
Bye, Bridie.

145
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:19,963
He's gone now, forever.

146
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,465
I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

147
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:26,344
Did I ever tell you
the time I jumped ship?

148
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,514
Jumped overboard about
200 yards out to sea...

149
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,100
Swam back to this godforsaken place.

150
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,356
Why did you swim back?

151
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,858
There was a woman involved.

152
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,653
Oh, aye?

153
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:48,449
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

154
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,211
What was her name?

155
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,213
Aye, you know her name.

156
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,591
You know your own
mother's name. Sarah.

157
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,593
Sarah Maguire she was.

158
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:09,971
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

159
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,609
Boarding all passengers.

160
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,445
All second-class passengers
boarding now.

161
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,285
Boarding all passengers.

162
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,288
All second-class passengers
boarding now.

163
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,583
Go and live.

164
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:40,710
Go and live, Son.

165
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,545
That's the best advice I can give you.

166
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,555
Remember, honest money goes further.

167
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,308
Honest money goes further.

168
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,310
A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

169
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,520
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

170
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:02,065
He had a cliche for every occasion.

171
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:06,319
I'll give you a call.

172
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,904
Right, Son.

173
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:13,117
I ran up the gangplank
to get away from him

174
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,328
and then I suddenly felt bad about it.

175
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,288
I decided to turn back

176
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,625
to call him Guiseppe for
the first time in my life.

177
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,129
When I turned around,
he had already walked away.

178
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,839
I just called after him.

179
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:27,924
Good-bye, Da!

180
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,766
Then I met
my old schoolmate, Paul Hill.

181
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:41,688
Little did I know that after meeting
him my life would change forever.

182
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:48,695
You're under arrest.

183
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,616
Fuck's sake, Gerry!

184
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:57,078
Still a head case.
James Bond, license to kill.

185
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,665
Look at you, you're a fucking nervous wreck.
What's the matter with you?

186
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,417
I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

187
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,585
Whoo!

188
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:09,882
Where're you going?

189
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,676
I'm going to London.
What about you?

190
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,802
The same.

191
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,929
I need a drink.

192
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,974
Aye, I'm skint.
I'll let you buy me one.

193
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,072
Once upon a time you dressed so fine

194
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:38,494
You threw the bums a dime
in your prime, didn't you?

195
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,332
I arrived in London
on the 26th of June.

196
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,960
My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie,

197
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,337
but I had an invitation
to a hippie commune

198
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,840
from my old friend Paddy Armstrong.

199
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,593
Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.

200
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,011
It's only that big on the map.

201
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,179
Yeah, but it's a map, Gerry.

202
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,556
London's a big place, you know.

203
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,564
What I was really looking
for was free love and dope.

204
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,817
I think it's this way.

205
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,501
Paddy?

206
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,129
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

207
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,798
Paddy who?
Paddy from Belfast.

208
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,132
You know, Paddy Armstrong.

209
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:35,718
Paddy!

210
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:40,056
There's some people here to see you!
Who is it?

211
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,225
Some Irish boys.

212
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,559
Jesus! Gerry Conlon.

213
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:44,727
What about you, Paddy?

214
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,104
Fuck's sake, I thought you was
the drug squad. Come on in.

215
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:54,904
There you go.

216
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,034
Welcome to Xanadu.

217
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,246
Hi.

218
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,582
Jesus fucking wept.

219
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:08,918
Neat, ain't it?

220
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:11,212
Deptford Jim.

221
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,673
Paul Hill.
Gerry Conlon from home. Right.

222
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,761
Before you can enter the circle,

223
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,931
you have to have the rite of passage.

224
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,767
Open your mouth.

225
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,823
Ah, I enjoyed that.

226
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,618
They can't stay.
There's not enough room.

227
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:46,789
Jim! Our rule.
No property, no law.

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Just love.

229
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,586
All right, let's vote on it.
If you want Gerry and...

230
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,629
What's your name?
Paul.

231
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:58,551
No. We're gonna call you
Saddest Moon.

232
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,429
Fuck off.
Saddest Moon.

233
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:02,555
Right?

234
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:06,517
If you want Gerry and Saddest
Moon to stay, raise your hands.

235
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,020
Four, five, six...

236
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:11,355
Put your fucking hand up, Paddy. Right.

237
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,983
Eight. Looks like we're staying then.

238
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,491
What shall we call you then?

239
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,411
You can call me Wild One.

240
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:29,165
Here, hold on. Come here.

241
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,000
Get off him, all right?

242
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:33,044
What's the fucking problem?

243
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:35,171
Gerry, Gerry, Gerry, Gerry!

244
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,547
They have dead pig in here.

245
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,008
Just some sausages.

246
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,885
We're all vegetarians here.

247
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,512
I am a vegetarian.
We're both vegetarians.

248
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,932
I was just taking them
sausages to me Auntie Annie's.

249
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,600
Look, I have to be around there now.

250
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:50,519
I'll be back in a few
minutes, all right?

251
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,229
Be back in a few minutes.

252
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,358
Piggy.

253
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,234
And Porky.

254
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:05,660
Is she related to the Royal
Family or something?

255
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,119
Aye, she's fifth in line
to the throne.

256
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,582
Ferguson's sausages, only good thing

257
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,292
that came out of
that godforsaken place.

258
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:14,835
Would you like some more?
No, I'm fine, thanks.

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,253
We better make tracks.

260
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,130
You sure you won't you stay?
I've the bed made up.

261
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,175
You're very kind, but we need
a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

262
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,718
We're forming a band and that there.

263
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,971
Aye. A rock band.

264
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,766
Where are you staying?

265
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:32,395
What, the address, you mean?
Uh-huh.

266
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:36,399
Fillmore.
Fillimore.

267
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:41,487
Fillimore Road. Fillimore Road.
It's number sixty-something.

268
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:43,531
The number dropped off the door.

269
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,160
What do you mean, the number
dropped off the door?

270
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,581
Well, would you let me have it when
you find out what it is, please?

271
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,418
Aye. And would you phone your mother?

272
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,004
Aye.
There's only one problem.

273
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:02,341
It doesn't have a phone.

274
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:11,058
Hello, Marian. Any problems? No.

275
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:12,601
Is it all there?
Yeah.

276
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:15,604
Okay. We're in business.

277
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,441
Watch the cracks.
Watch the cracks.

278
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,693
It's not fair.
Their skirts are covering the cracks.

279
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,570
He's cheating!

280
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:24,905
I'm a referee!
He's cheating.

281
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:31,954
Go!

282
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,133
Whack!

283
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:46,469
Yay!

284
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:50,473
Boom!

285
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,496
That wasn't too far away, was it?

286
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,914
Is that a bomb, Paddy?

287
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,332
It's getting more like home.

288
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,002
Hello?
Hold on, hold on.

289
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,755
Guiseppe. Guiseppe.
Long-distance call.

290
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,715
What?
Long-distance call.

291
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,095
Go ahead.
Hello?

292
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,181
Ask him for the money, Gerry.
Hey, it's Gerry speaking.

293
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:33,766
Son.
Hi. How are you doing?

294
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,850
I'm fine. How are you?
Ask him.

295
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,019
It's been six weeks, you know,
since you've been in touch.

296
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,146
I know. Sorry about that.
I've been a bit busy.

297
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:42,608
It's just your ma's just a bit worried, you know.
You still going to mass?

298
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,653
Aye, every Sunday.
Like clockwork. Good.

299
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:48,280
Are you working?
I have a couple of things going here.

300
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,157
A couple of things going here.
Good. Ah, good.

301
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,450
And are you safe?

302
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,536
How do you mean?
From all the bombs.

303
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:57,832
Aye, you could just hear them
in the distance like, but...

304
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,708
Sorry about that.

305
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,378
Are you stuck?
How do you mean, Da?

306
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,587
Are you short of cash?

307
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,298
Uh, no. No, I'm flush
at the moment.

308
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,884
No problem.
No, I have plenty of money.

309
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,220
All right.
And, Gerry, keep in touch.

310
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,097
Aye. All right.
Bye-bye, Da.

311
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,640
All right, Son.
I'll tell your ma...

312
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,060
Bye.

313
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:21,730
Sorry about that.

314
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,108
We've enough for chips.

315
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:29,446
Sorry, we'd only
enough money for two chips.

316
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,825
Are you all right?
What?

317
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,869
There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

318
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,204
There they are.
It's the Irish.

319
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:39,748
Bringing all their troubles
over here again.

320
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,835
Aye, it's all right when it
happens over in Belfast.

321
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,503
You fucking prick!

322
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:47,923
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

323
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,176
You stupid fucking prick!

324
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,927
Go home! Fuck you!

325
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,180
I don't fucking believe this.
I'm getting out of here.

326
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,764
Are you coming, Paddy?

327
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:56,974
Where are you gonna sleep?

328
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:00,436
Ah, no problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

329
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:04,023
I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
Take care.

330
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,775
Mind your fucking manners!
Prick.

331
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,070
Troops have entered the
Ardoyne area of West Belfast

332
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:14,408
following the collapse of the provisional
IRA cease-fire over the weekend.

333
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,118
Yeah, I'm watching it.

334
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,244
Civilians have been evacuated,

335
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,497
and there are reports
of casualties in many areas.

336
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:21,624
Both sides are blaming each other...

337
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,834
Okay, I'll take care of it.

338
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,505
That's it. 8:00 tonight.

339
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:31,800
No warning.

340
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:42,519
That's my place.
Youse are sitting there too long.

341
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,524
CB, Charlie Burke.
That's me.

342
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,694
I carved my initials
with this penknife.

343
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,073
No problem, Charlie. No problem.
Whatever you say.

344
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:57,493
Closing the park.
Park closing now.

345
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:58,619
Easy with the feet there, Charlie.

346
00:22:58,703 --> 00:22:59,995
It's a big bench, you know, Charlie?

347
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,039
There's room for three of us here.

348
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,292
You're Irish too, aren't you?

349
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,506
I come over here
when I was about your age.

350
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:12,967
Did you ever think
of going home, Charlie?

351
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:14,593
Nah, I should.

352
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,805
There's nothing for me over there now.

353
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,226
Closing the park!

354
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,354
Could you...
Could you lend us a few shillings?

355
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,981
I was gonna ask you the same.

356
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:28,357
Oh.

357
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,574
Gerry, we've no money left.
It's all I have.

358
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:40,703
Well, now, I wouldn't like
to take all your money.

359
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,579
No problem.
Catch you again, Charlie.

360
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:44,623
Come on, come on.
It's not even 8:00 yet.

361
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,250
All right, all right.

362
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,973
We must've just said good night to
Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.

363
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:02,516
I mean, all we were concerned about

364
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,810
was where we were
gonna sleep that night.

365
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,812
We'd no money in our pockets.

366
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:11,358
We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford
even if we'd known where it was.

367
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,862
No fucking way I'm going
back to Belfast.

368
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:16,780
I tell you that.

369
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:22,036
Hey, blondie.
Hey, sexy.

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,537
You dropped something.

371
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:25,205
Back off, Paddy.

372
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:27,082
She's outta your league.

373
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,751
Here.

374
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:38,802
It's her fucking keys.
I'm going in.

375
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,304
We should give 'em back, Gerry.

376
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:41,472
Put 'em through the letter box.

377
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:44,391
Put the keys back
in the letter box, Gerry.

378
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,656
Jesus Christ, how much money is there?

379
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:47,329
I got £700 from
the hooker's apartment.

380
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,374
I did feel a little bit
guilty about that.

381
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,710
We spent that night in a hotel.

382
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:58,632
The next day we went and bought the
same clothes, the same trousers,

383
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:01,176
same jackets, even the same shoes.

384
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:05,931
They seek him here They seek him there

385
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:08,350
His clothes are loud

386
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,352
But never square

387
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:15,691
Hey, mister, has your coat got fleas?

388
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,030
...'Cause he's a dedicated
follower of fashion

389
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:27,744
And when he does his little rounds

390
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,250
Round the boutiques of London Town...

391
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:42,134
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

392
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:47,306
Did you miss me, Bridie?
Look at Gerry.

393
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,224
He's a hippie!

394
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:50,726
Daddy, look at the money!

395
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,227
Do you want it?
Oh, my God!

396
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,395
Want some treats?

397
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,980
Do you wanna be in my gang?

398
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:57,691
Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang.
I wanna be in your gang.

399
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:01,904
Over here.
Take it easy.

400
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:04,823
Steady. Hey, calm it down.
Just calm it down.

401
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:06,742
It's my money!
It's mine!

402
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,494
No, it's my money.
Calm it down. Stop it.

403
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:09,703
It's my money!
Stop that!

404
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:11,580
He gave it to me!
Stop that!

405
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:21,006
And they were always talking
about the troubles, were they?

406
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,675
Yeah. Especially Paul Hill.

407
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,596
He was always talking about
Belfast, the IRA, all that stuff.

408
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,434
Look, all I'm saying is this.

409
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,438
They had a lot of money, and
Conlon went back to Belfast.

410
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,107
Come along, into the car.
What the fuck is going on?

411
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,695
That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.

412
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,822
Aye.
Did it hurt you, Danny?

413
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,032
It wasn't too bad.

414
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:49,409
The bullet bounced off the kneecap
and come out the other side.

415
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:50,911
Five people are dead

416
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:54,456
and 75 seriously injured
as a result of the IRA's

417
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,543
no-warning bomb attack
on the Guildford pub.

418
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:00,379
Parliament has passed the
Prevention of Terrorism Act

419
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:05,300
which allows terrorist suspects to be held
in police custody for up to seven days.

420
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:07,594
Seven days. Geez.

421
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,806
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

422
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,142
...around London
and arrested 19 suspects.

423
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:16,895
Gerry, there's your shoes.

424
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,856
Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert
Dixon of the antiterrorist squad

425
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,400
about those arrests.

426
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:23,652
We can't pretend people
won't be inconvenienced.

427
00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:25,779
Some of them may not deserve it.

428
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:28,865
That's why we shall use these
powers as selectively as possible.

429
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,751
Get up out of bed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!

430
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:41,670
Hands above your head!

431
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,881
I don't know what the fuck youse are
looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

432
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:48,927
Gerry, your coat.
He's done nothing.

433
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,345
Inside, sir.
He's not political.

434
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,556
I have a right to speak to my son.

435
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,849
Keep calm, Gerry.
Da! Da!

436
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,142
Keep calm, Gerry.

437
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,688
Get back in.
Get back inside.

438
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:04,568
It's all right.
It's all right.

439
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:21,335
Where are we going?

440
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,419
You'll find out soon enough.

441
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:26,715
Where'd he get this money?

442
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,091
I don't know.

443
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,888
They have no right
to take him to England.

444
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:37,601
Slow down a bit.

445
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:32,656
Look, I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about, so I don't.

446
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:40,262
I've done nothing wrong.

447
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,557
When can I go back to Belfast?

448
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:01,476
Next time you see Belfast, they'll
be flying day trips to the moon.

449
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:04,604
I always wanted to be an astronaut.

450
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,576
What are you charging me with?

451
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,037
You're being held under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act.

452
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,080
What?

453
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:25,208
We can hold you for seven days and
seven nights without charging you.

454
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,836
Since when was I a fucking terrorist?
Were you part of that, Gerry?

455
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,842
And that.
You proud of that?

456
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,929
And that. Why are you
showing me these people?

457
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,768
No marks! Don't mark him!
Don't mark him!

458
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:45,061
Are you fucking proud of that, huh?

459
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:48,023
Look at that!
Look at that young, pretty girl there!

460
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,400
Now look at her!

461
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:51,985
You're out of your fucking minds!

462
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:53,779
Do you?
You're out of your fucking minds!

463
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,533
The children know there's
something terrible going on.

464
00:31:58,618 --> 00:31:59,868
And you're not making it any easier.

465
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,953
I haven't the strength for this.

466
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:05,624
If he killed innocent people, I
haven't the strength for the child.

467
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,001
Listen, I know that child.
I carried that child.

468
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:10,212
Now, if you're not gonna
believe in him, I will.

469
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,922
What, you think he's innocent?

470
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,758
When your son walked through that door
looking like a bloody circus clown,

471
00:32:14,842 --> 00:32:16,259
do you think he had murder
in his eyes?

472
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:19,346
Happy birthday to you

473
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,555
It's a surprise.

474
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,767
Happy birthday to you...
Shut up. No, shut up, shut up!

475
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,241
When will Daddy be back?

476
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,743
He'll be back in a couple of days.

477
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,038
Why did they put Gerry in jail?

478
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,665
It's a mistake.

479
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,752
I'm on my way over
to bring him back home.

480
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:54,422
Why are you getting
narky again? Eh?

481
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,174
Are we touching a sore spot?

482
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,885
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England, Gerry.

483
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,763
I told you about 100 times already.

484
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:03,723
Then tell us again!

485
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,813
I stayed at the squat
most of the time.

486
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:11,314
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's...

487
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,109
And one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

488
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,294
Male. Late 40s.

489
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,796
Who taught you how to
make the bomb, Gerry?

490
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,632
I never made any bombs.

491
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:39,885
Did Annie make the bomb, Gerry?

492
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,972
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

493
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:47,309
Is Annie Marian?

494
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:49,895
Annie who?

495
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:51,062
Annie Maguire!

496
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,690
My Aunt Annie?

497
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:57,152
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

498
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,779
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

499
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:02,240
Are you Marian?

500
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:06,620
What?

501
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:08,997
Are you Marian?

502
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:11,708
She had nothing to do with it.

503
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:19,424
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

504
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:21,509
He says I done Guildford.

505
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,555
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

506
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,058
Show me what you want me to sign.

507
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,435
I have an alibi for that night.

508
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,275
What are you showing me these for?

509
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,071
Gerry told us you did it.

510
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,199
Then he's a fucking liar.

511
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,576
Armstrong drove the car.

512
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:49,371
Who was the woman in the back?

513
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,166
I don't know.

514
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:55,710
But you were in the Ford Cortina.

515
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,506
But you were in the red Ford Cortina.

516
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,716
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

517
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,344
I told you I was...

518
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:07,555
I told you I was in the Cortina.
I told you it was a taxi.

519
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,891
No. The taxi was
a Toyota Corolla.

520
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:11,434
When can I ring home?

521
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,062
Let's start again.
Who's Marian?

522
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:16,147
- Was it someone Irish?
- Gerry?

523
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,192
Why are you getting narky again?
Touching a sore spot?

524
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:20,360
What was her name?

525
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:21,695
Nothing to do with what?

526
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,071
Nothing to do with what, Gerry?

527
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,155
Talk to me.

528
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,657
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

529
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:29,577
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?"

530
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:33,123
Who taught you how
to make the bomb, Gerry?

531
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,335
Gerry, talk to me.

532
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:43,591
No?

533
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:46,302
He'll do what he's told.

534
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,556
Look at him.
He's a lying bastard.

535
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,267
He's a right fucking comedian.
Aren't you, Gerry?

536
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,476
Who's Marian?

537
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:54,602
I don't know what...

538
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,354
I'm getting fucking bored with this.

539
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:57,981
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know.

540
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:00,191
I'm gonna keep on
asking you the question

541
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,068
until you give me a fucking answer!

542
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:03,737
Who is Marian?
I don't know!

543
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,030
Yes, you fucking do!

544
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:07,115
Bollocks! Who is Marian?

545
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:13,163
We know who Marian is.

546
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:26,384
Are you the man in charge? Yes, I am.

547
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:28,678
For fuck's sake,
tell 'em to stop hurting me.

548
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,435
I swear to God...

549
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,646
I know where I was
at the time of the bombings.

550
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,737
I was with a madman
called Charlie Burke.

551
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:49,532
Have you any other alibis?

552
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,327
I have told youse before...

553
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:55,497
I was with Paul Hill most of the day.

554
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:05,590
Tell Gerry Conlon
like you said you would.

555
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:14,808
Who's this?

556
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:15,892
Gerry Conlon.

557
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,690
Have you anything to say to him?

558
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,694
I've cleared my conscience.

559
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,531
I advise you to do the same.

560
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:45,755
There's your statement.

561
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:50,051
I didn't do this.

562
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:53,513
I didn't fucking do this!

563
00:37:55,224 --> 00:37:57,600
I didn't do it.

564
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,520
Please believe me.

565
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,065
What are you doing to me?

566
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,740
They wouldn't hold him if
he hadn't done something.

567
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,284
Gerry is no angel.

568
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,577
I know that.

569
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,537
He needs a strong hand.

570
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:20,748
Don't bloody move!

571
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,459
Get your hands up!
Put your hands on your head!

572
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:25,420
You're all under arrest.

573
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:29,048
No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child!
Put your hands up!

574
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,509
You're all being held under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act.

575
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:40,435
Is Hill leading us up the garden path?

576
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,772
I don't know.

577
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:50,904
I can make him confess.

578
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:52,655
Why don't you have a word in his ear?

579
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:56,201
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

580
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:57,994
Will you have the bomber?

581
00:38:58,078 --> 00:39:00,330
Our job is to stop the bombing.

582
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,435
I'm gonna shoot your da.

583
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:08,606
What did you say to me?

584
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:13,361
Little Bridie'll have no daddy.

585
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,322
I'm gonna shoot Guiseppe.

586
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,710
He's threatening to shoot my da!

587
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,170
He's threatening to kill my da!

588
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:34,299
Look at him!
Look at him!

589
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,551
Look at him!
He's a madman!

590
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,553
I think you're hallucinating, son.

591
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:41,097
Nobody's gonna harm your father.

592
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:42,765
No!

593
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,309
Get him back.
Get him back.

594
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:48,604
He threatened to kill my da.

595
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:50,481
Nobody's gonna kill your father.

596
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:52,233
You mad bastard!

597
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:53,901
Take it easy, son.
Take it easy.

598
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,946
He's not gonna harm your father.

599
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:00,908
Come on, let it all out.

600
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,578
Let it all out, all that hatred.

601
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,500
You hate us, don't you?
Hmm?

602
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:12,503
You hate us enough to bomb and maim.

603
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:16,090
That is the trouble.
You let it all out. Come on.

604
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:17,550
I don't hate you.

605
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:18,718
Yes, you do.

606
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:21,596
I can see it in your face.
I can see all that hatred.

607
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:25,016
So why don't you just
let it off your chest, huh,

608
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,602
before it starts to mess up
with your mind?

609
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:35,651
Give me the fucking statement.

610
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:39,489
For fuck's sake,
give me the statement.

611
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:43,242
Give me a fucking pen.

612
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,503
Right, that's my fucking name there.

613
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:55,463
You can write what you like.

614
00:41:57,132 --> 00:41:59,759
All right,
nice and easy. Come on.

615
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:02,387
Paul! Paul! What's going on?

616
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,723
Gerry! They stuck a
fucking gun in my mouth!

617
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:07,975
So I told 'em a lot of bullshit!

618
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,727
Why did you give 'em my fucking name?

619
00:42:09,812 --> 00:42:11,062
I'm sorry!

620
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:12,980
It's fucking mad!

621
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:18,111
It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

622
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,696
The four of us were split up.

623
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,699
I was taken to
South London Remand Center.

624
00:42:23,784 --> 00:42:26,119
You can check the dates, Gareth.

625
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:27,912
Kill that fucker!

626
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,050
You fucking son of an Irish cow!

627
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:48,599
Kick that Irish fucking ass!

628
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:49,934
What is that?

629
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:51,018
Delousing.

630
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:52,603
I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.

631
00:42:52,688 --> 00:42:54,689
You have no choice, mate.

632
00:42:57,192 --> 00:43:00,403
Okay, Conlon.
Go see the room, shall we?

633
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,201
Come on, Mr. Conlon.

634
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,876
We got your son.

635
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:18,045
Well, let's go, shall we?

636
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:19,922
Da!

637
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:23,759
Da! Da! Da! Da!

638
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:24,802
Is that you, Son?

639
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:25,887
Da, here!

640
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:28,055
Da!
Where are you?

641
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,229
Don't hurt my father.
Don't hurt my father.

642
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:36,439
It'll be all right, Son.
It'll be all right.

643
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:37,482
Don't kill him!

644
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:39,150
Da!

645
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:43,779
Come on, move along.

646
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:45,698
Move along.
Come on, you.

647
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:46,949
Fuck you!

648
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,159
Shut up, you!

649
00:43:49,703 --> 00:43:50,786
Shut up!

650
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:51,913
On the floor!

651
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:05,801
What the fuck are you doing here, Da?

652
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:09,055
I come over to your Aunt
Annie's to get you a lawyer.

653
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,765
They arrested everybody in the house.

654
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,433
What?

655
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,435
What for, fuck's sake?

656
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,895
Conspiracy to murder.

657
00:44:16,146 --> 00:44:19,023
Oh, no. Oh, fuck's sake, no.
Jesus Christ!

658
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:27,490
Did you do it?
Did you do it, Son?

659
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:29,116
No, I did not!

660
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:36,916
Of course I fucking
didn't do it, fuck's sake!

661
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:48,761
Why are you looking at me like that?

662
00:44:49,304 --> 00:44:50,304
What?

663
00:44:54,268 --> 00:44:55,393
Why are you looking at me like that?

664
00:44:55,477 --> 00:44:56,561
Like what?

665
00:44:56,853 --> 00:45:00,106
Why do you always
follow me? Huh?

666
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:04,527
Why do you always follow me
when I do something wrong?

667
00:45:04,611 --> 00:45:07,321
Why can't you follow me
when I do something right?

668
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:08,739
What are you talking about?

669
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,325
Huh? What am I talking about?
I'm talking about the medal.

670
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:12,785
What medal?

671
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:14,912
What fucking medal?
What fucking medal?

672
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:17,540
The only fucking medal
that was ever in our house.

673
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:19,375
That fucking medal.

674
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,836
The medal I won at football.

675
00:45:22,546 --> 00:45:24,839
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions,

676
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,257
like you could only see
what I was doing...

677
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,926
You couldn't even
fucking play football

678
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,679
and you could only see
what I was doing wrong.

679
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,723
I could never do anything
good enough for you.

680
00:45:33,807 --> 00:45:36,726
And after the game, you came
up to me and you said...

681
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,562
You said, "Gerry, did you
foul the ball?"

682
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:41,564
And I walked away from you,
do you remember now?

683
00:45:41,648 --> 00:45:43,357
I walked away from you
into the dressing room.

684
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:46,611
You followed me in there and you said
again, "Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

685
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:47,862
And all the other fathers
were in there.

686
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:50,948
They were laughing at you,
calling you "Poor Guiseppe."

687
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:54,452
And I ran out, and I hid, and I
wrote your name on the ground,

688
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,329
your stupid Guiseppe fucking name,

689
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:59,707
I wrote it in the dirt,
and I fucking pissed on it!

690
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,460
I pissed on it...

691
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,296
Because I did foul the ball.

692
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:09,216
What did it matter? We won.
For once in our lives, we won.

693
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:10,593
You ruined that medal for me!

694
00:46:10,677 --> 00:46:12,553
I took it to the pawn,
and they laughed at me.

695
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,096
They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.

696
00:46:14,181 --> 00:46:15,222
This is shock.

697
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:19,393
And that's when I started to rob,
to prove that I was no good.

698
00:46:19,728 --> 00:46:20,728
Delayed shock.

699
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:21,979
Delayed shock.
Never mind delayed shock.

700
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:24,690
I've been like this since I was seven.

701
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,902
I remember Mummy said to me, "Don't
upset Guiseppe. He's not well."

702
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:29,570
Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.

703
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:30,905
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

704
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,324
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.

705
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:35,159
"Not well, you know.
He's not well."

706
00:46:35,243 --> 00:46:37,912
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

707
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:40,748
I mean, is it my fault
you weren't well?

708
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:43,376
Why did you have to be sick
all your life, Guiseppe?

709
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,503
Why did you have to be sick
all your life for?

710
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:49,340
When that mad bastard out there
threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

711
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:51,425
I swear to God.
Honest to God, I was happy.

712
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,885
I was delighted!
You know why?

713
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:54,178
Because finally it was all over.

714
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:56,347
It was over! You see?

715
00:46:57,766 --> 00:46:59,767
And then I knew I was bad.

716
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:02,645
I knew I was bad then, you
see, so I started to cry.

717
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:05,022
I started to tell lies,
the same fucking lies

718
00:47:05,107 --> 00:47:08,234
I've been telling
all my gobshite fucking life.

719
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,783
Do you know what that mean?
It means words don't mean nothing.

720
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:16,867
Stop this.

721
00:47:16,952 --> 00:47:19,245
Huh? Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

722
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:21,038
But it doesn't matter, does it?
'Cause I'm no good anyhow.

723
00:47:21,123 --> 00:47:22,540
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

724
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:25,376
Keep away from me. You've been
following me all your fucking life,

725
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,545
and now here you are in jail.
You doing this deliberately?

726
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:28,963
No. Stop it.
Are you doing it deliberately?

727
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,881
Are you doing it deliberately?

728
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,508
You call that a fucking dig, huh?

729
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:33,551
Do you call that a fucking dig?

730
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:34,885
Hit me harder.
Hit me like...

731
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,388
Hit me fucking harder!
Hit me fucking harder!

732
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:38,931
Stop it. Calm down.
For once in your fucking life!

733
00:47:39,015 --> 00:47:40,725
Hit me like a real father!
Just calm down. Stop it.

734
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:43,310
Stop it.

735
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:51,318
Just relax.

736
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,820
Hmm?

737
00:47:53,155 --> 00:47:54,947
Relax.

738
00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:56,240
Yeah?

739
00:47:57,033 --> 00:48:00,244
Will you tell them,
or shall I tell them?

740
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:04,165
You're my child.
It's okay.

741
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,921
It's not your fault, Son, all right?

742
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,883
Everything's gonna be all right.

743
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:17,261
Okay. All right, Son.

744
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,390
Visitor for Conlon!

745
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,728
Two on for visit!

746
00:48:34,613 --> 00:48:36,030
No touching.

747
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:38,115
Everybody else was allowed to touch.

748
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,868
IRA, closed visits.
No contact.

749
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:54,381
Why are you doing this to us?

750
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:58,928
You have your father locked
up in prison for murder.

751
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:00,638
Speak up, please.

752
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:03,307
It's not my fault, Ma.

753
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:05,601
Take it easy, Sarah.

754
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:11,899
I swear to God,
I've done nothing wrong.

755
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:15,069
Why did you sign a confession, Son?

756
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:17,696
He did it to protect me, love.

757
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,616
You have a good son there and
that's all you need to know.

758
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,744
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Guiseppe?

759
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,747
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

760
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:30,376
Look, they've no statement
nor evidence against me.

761
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,503
I'll be out and home soon.

762
00:49:32,587 --> 00:49:34,755
Sure, I'm only visiting here myself.

763
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:38,425
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

764
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,138
Danny's dead, Gerry.

765
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:45,516
What?

766
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,563
They found his body on waste ground.

767
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,858
The IRA said he was
an incurable thief.

768
00:49:57,779 --> 00:50:00,281
I sent a mass card from the family.

769
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:06,704
This one'll not go to school
since you've been away.

770
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:08,664
Hey, you go to school for your mummy.

771
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,416
Yes, Daddy.

772
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,627
Daddy, when will you be home?

773
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:18,883
I've pressed your Sunday
suits for the trial.

774
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:21,468
You make sure
and look your best now, Son.

775
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:26,765
But is there nitro
or was there not nitro?

776
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:30,477
Yes, there are traces of nitro.

777
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:32,605
But are they all positive?

778
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:35,316
Well, yes, on six of them.

779
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:37,401
Who'd we miss?

780
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:39,403
The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

781
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:43,157
But her rubber glove
showed a faint trace.

782
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,118
And the children?
The children?

783
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,329
Positive.

784
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:53,167
The results may not
be good enough for court.

785
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,503
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

786
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:00,007
Yes, sir.

787
00:51:04,763 --> 00:51:06,722
Kill the bastards!
Kill 'em!

788
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:14,355
Shoot the bastards!

789
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:30,663
Call number one.

790
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,418
Let's go.
Jesus, it's a nightmare, Guiseppe.

791
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:38,587
Just stay calm,
be on your best behavior,

792
00:51:38,672 --> 00:51:40,965
and this'll be behind us soon.

793
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:42,883
That's it, come on.

794
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,177
Say a wee prayer.

795
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,390
It will be all right.

796
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:02,027
All rise.

797
00:52:20,797 --> 00:52:24,883
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the Crown.

798
00:52:29,597 --> 00:52:33,267
There are two series of charges
here, ladies and gentlemen.

799
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:35,978
The four defendants in front

800
00:52:36,938 --> 00:52:41,650
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub

801
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:44,028
and the murders of five people.

802
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,448
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

803
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:50,075
The seven defendants behind

804
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,202
are charged with the
possession of explosives.

805
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:53,996
They're not charged with murder.

806
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:56,373
The Crown's case against them is

807
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:59,084
that they are a support
network for the bombers,

808
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:01,128
and as such should be
considered totally independent.

809
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:03,088
Control yourself.
Pay attention.

810
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:07,634
My first witness is
Inspector Robert Dixon.

811
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,805
"I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give shall be the truth,

812
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,767
"the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

813
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:21,273
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

814
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:27,196
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson,

815
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,281
confessed to the bombing.

816
00:53:29,824 --> 00:53:31,492
They are the IRA's ASU.

817
00:53:31,701 --> 00:53:34,161
Can you explain ASUs for us?

818
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:35,954
Active Service Unit.

819
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:37,414
They are the elite of the IRA,

820
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,291
those who carry out the
bombings and the shootings.

821
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:41,251
Very often they are combat veterans

822
00:53:41,336 --> 00:53:44,421
with previous experience
of shooting at soldiers

823
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:45,547
and planting explosives.

824
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,467
And the others,
Annie Maguire and her family?

825
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,928
They are the IRA's support network.

826
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,679
They store...

827
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:55,682
Their families, friends, they
store the weapons and explosives

828
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:59,103
and they provide
what we call safe houses.

829
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:01,814
Thank you, Inspector.

830
00:54:03,858 --> 00:54:05,567
Inspector, these people were arrested

831
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:09,029
two days after the Prevention of
Terrorism Act was introduced.

832
00:54:09,697 --> 00:54:11,031
That's correct.

833
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:14,034
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

834
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:16,954
It permits us to hold
suspected terrorists

835
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:19,164
for a period of up to seven days.

836
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:21,792
Quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy.

837
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,585
Quite difficult, I would've
thought, for the police

838
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,213
to resist the temptation to
deal forcibly with people.

839
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,297
Objection.

840
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:29,883
People whom they suspect of
the biggest bombing campaign

841
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:32,261
on British mainland
since the Second World War.

842
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:33,971
Objection.
My Lord, I really must...

843
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:35,430
Get to the point!

844
00:54:35,557 --> 00:54:37,516
Now, this bombing campaign

845
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,145
struck deep into the British
people's sense of security.

846
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:44,815
The people looked to you, Inspector,
to find those responsible.

847
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:45,941
Yes.

848
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:48,819
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

849
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:50,904
That's my job.

850
00:54:51,948 --> 00:54:54,116
Now, all of the defendants claim...

851
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,244
Including young Patrick
Maguire, aged just 14.

852
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,330
Patrick, would you stand up, please?

853
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:04,251
Thank you.
All of the defendants claim

854
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:08,463
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while under police custody.

855
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:12,759
They were never harmed in any way.

856
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:14,678
He's fucking lying!
They beat the shite out of us!

857
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:20,142
Silence! Stop this noise!

858
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,729
Please believe us!
They beat us!

859
00:55:24,147 --> 00:55:25,856
Silence!
Just be quiet.

860
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,774
Sit them down!

861
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:29,776
Silence in the court!

862
00:55:32,906 --> 00:55:34,573
Mr. Conlon says

863
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:38,619
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

864
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:41,371
I never even spoke
to Mr. Conlon.

865
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:43,457
I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

866
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,000
Silence!

867
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:49,463
Mr. Hill says the police sat astride
him and put a gun in his mouth.

868
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:53,217
There was no pressure of any kind.

869
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:56,386
You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!

870
00:55:56,471 --> 00:55:58,472
Order! Order in court!

871
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:01,141
Inspector, in the case
of the four main defendants,

872
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:03,268
you have no corroborating
evidence of any kind.

873
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:06,647
I have the confessions of four obvious terrorists.
What more do you want?

874
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:10,234
Well, nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance.

875
00:56:10,526 --> 00:56:12,236
It's when the substance
to be tested...

876
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,614
After a few weeks, we were
bored out of our minds.

877
00:56:16,032 --> 00:56:18,450
Just messed around and that there.

878
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:21,328
They must've been
desperate for evidence.

879
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:23,121
They produced my Auntie
Annie's washing-up gloves

880
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:25,707
like a rabbit out of a hat
at one point.

881
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,293
Then it was my turn to take the stand.

882
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:31,713
Mr. Conlon,
did you bomb Guildford?

883
00:56:32,674 --> 00:56:34,174
No, I didn't.

884
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:37,761
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night of the bombing.

885
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:39,638
Can you tell us where you were?

886
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:42,557
I was in a park in London
at that time.

887
00:56:42,642 --> 00:56:43,892
Who with?

888
00:56:43,977 --> 00:56:45,602
With Paul Hill sitting there.

889
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:49,147
You met somebody else that
night, about 8:00 p.m.

890
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:52,401
Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.

891
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:53,819
And who is he?

892
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:56,363
He was just like a,
you know, like a fellow,

893
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,156
a homeless guy
that we met in the park.

894
00:56:58,866 --> 00:57:00,492
Why do you remember
this man so clearly?

895
00:57:01,703 --> 00:57:04,121
I remember thinking that if I
didn't get out of London fast,

896
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:05,539
I was gonna end up like him.

897
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,959
You told this to the police?
Aye.

898
00:57:09,043 --> 00:57:10,168
What did they say?

899
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:11,712
They said he didn't exist.

900
00:57:12,922 --> 00:57:16,508
Mr. Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

901
00:57:18,136 --> 00:57:19,678
They beat me

902
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:22,764
and then they threatened
to kill my father.

903
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:25,267
Will you repeat that please?

904
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:27,477
They terrorized me for seven days.

905
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:30,230
And after that, they
threatened to kill my father.

906
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:32,649
I'd have fucking signed
anything after that.

907
00:57:34,068 --> 00:57:35,110
Excuse my language.

908
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:36,194
Thank you.

909
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:42,242
You expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers

910
00:57:42,618 --> 00:57:45,662
would risk their career
and their reputation

911
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:47,873
by threatening your father?

912
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:50,667
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them,

913
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:52,586
but it happens to be truth, you know.

914
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:54,921
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr. Conlon?

915
00:57:56,215 --> 00:57:57,424
I like to think so.

916
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:01,762
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

917
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:03,764
Aye.

918
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:08,185
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

919
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:10,896
Let me refresh your memory.

920
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,356
You told Inspector Dixon

921
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,983
that you had committed
a robbery on that night.

922
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,861
Now do you remember?

923
00:58:20,198 --> 00:58:21,281
Aye.

924
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:23,575
Who did you rob?

925
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:26,495
Robbed a hooker.

926
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:28,205
You robbed a prostitute?

927
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:29,414
Aye.

928
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,875
And we are expected to believe a man

929
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:34,044
who claims he stole from a prostitute

930
00:58:34,128 --> 00:58:36,713
before we would
believe 10 police officers

931
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:39,674
who stood here on oath
and called you a liar?

932
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:42,010
It's the truth.

933
00:58:42,095 --> 00:58:43,428
You know, I mean...

934
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:46,932
I'm bound to say I don't
find you very convincing.

935
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:49,017
Thank you, Mr. Conlon.

936
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:57,150
Why didn't you tell me that
you stole from that woman?

937
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,155
You should've called me.
I would've sent the money.

938
00:59:08,496 --> 00:59:11,665
Are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life?

939
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:17,129
Standing up in that witness box,
making faces to your mates.

940
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:33,437
At least you told the truth in there.
That'll stand you.

941
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:42,571
Are you not going to eat that sausage?

942
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:44,698
No.

943
00:59:46,868 --> 00:59:48,952
They put a gun in my mouth

944
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,497
and made me confess to a
murder I didn't commit.

945
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,084
So I said I did the big bombing

946
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:59,671
and named anybody I knew
who was not in the IRA.

947
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:02,048
Not in the IRA?

948
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:03,717
Definitely not in the IRA.

949
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:05,177
Why?

950
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:08,013
You know why.

951
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,562
Well, I just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was.

952
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:19,608
Inspector, the defendant
Conlon presented an alibi.

953
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,359
One Charlie Burke.

954
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:23,904
Yes, sir, that name did appear in Mr.
Conlon's statement.

955
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,489
We investigated it.

956
01:00:25,573 --> 01:00:27,240
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

957
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,785
And then there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

958
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:33,830
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

959
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:37,709
At the start of this trial,
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

960
01:00:39,086 --> 01:00:40,420
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked

961
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:42,005
when a member of the legal
profession came to me

962
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:44,424
and asked me if I was now
going to wash my hand.

963
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:48,845
In my long legal career,
I cannot remember a case

964
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:50,972
where emotions have been so charged.

965
01:00:52,308 --> 01:00:54,226
It falls to me now to appeal to you

966
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,560
the members of the jury,

967
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:59,064
not to get caught up in
this tide of mass hysteria.

968
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:04,778
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

969
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:08,406
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess

970
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:11,409
through brutality and intimidation.

971
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:14,955
Now, they may be foolish,

972
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,958
petty thieves, even drug abusers.

973
01:01:19,252 --> 01:01:23,922
But they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

974
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:29,678
You should find these
young people not guilty.

975
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:32,305
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

976
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,267
Get your fucking hands off me! Move it!

977
01:01:37,478 --> 01:01:40,772
Hands off.
Hands off! Hands off!

978
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

979
01:01:47,488 --> 01:01:50,240
like my learned colleague
in the defense,

980
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:54,202
I would caution you not to
be swayed by your emotions.

981
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:58,123
The four people you see in the front

982
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:02,919
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies

983
01:02:03,004 --> 01:02:05,380
ever to set foot on English soil.

984
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,092
Now, here are the facts
of this case...

985
01:02:09,677 --> 01:02:11,177
Inspector Dixon,

986
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:13,638
a decorated officer
of great expertise,

987
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:17,142
acting on reliable information
and good detective work,

988
01:02:17,226 --> 01:02:19,019
arrested Paul Hill.

989
01:02:19,562 --> 01:02:23,607
Who, guilt-ridden by the shame
of his crime, confessed.

990
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:28,612
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon,

991
01:02:28,696 --> 01:02:30,822
and his terrorist family.

992
01:02:31,365 --> 01:02:35,744
His aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker

993
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:38,872
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives

994
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:41,583
in the kitchen
of her home in Harlesden.

995
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,127
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives.

996
01:02:44,211 --> 01:02:47,797
Vincent, aged 16, Patrick, 14,

997
01:02:47,882 --> 01:02:51,259
who did not...
Could not know any better.

998
01:02:52,386 --> 01:02:54,638
Guiseppe Conlon,
her brother-in-law,

999
01:02:54,722 --> 01:02:57,599
the courier who arrived
with more explosives.

1000
01:02:57,683 --> 01:03:01,686
Armstrong and his dupe,
Richardson, who carried the bomb.

1001
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:04,314
Now, these are the people
who, in a panic,

1002
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:07,400
had to dispose of the nitroglycerine.

1003
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:11,237
And that is what sealed their fate.

1004
01:03:12,198 --> 01:03:13,740
How do we know this?

1005
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:16,034
Because the truth was on their hands.

1006
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:23,416
It is a story written in the
blood of their victims.

1007
01:03:24,377 --> 01:03:26,711
You have seen some of those
who survived

1008
01:03:26,796 --> 01:03:29,464
their callous disregard
for human life.

1009
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:34,344
It is now your duty
to protect society from them.

1010
01:03:35,554 --> 01:03:38,807
I am confident that
that is what you will do.

1011
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:16,761
Have you reached a verdict?

1012
01:04:18,347 --> 01:04:19,806
Yes, we have, My Lord.

1013
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:24,144
How do you find the defendants?

1014
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:25,353
Guilty as charged.

1015
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:30,817
Hang the Irish bastards!

1016
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:34,904
Order! Silence!

1017
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:39,367
String 'em up!

1018
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:49,002
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

1019
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:51,463
Stand up.

1020
01:04:54,759 --> 01:04:58,011
I feel it is my duty to wonder aloud

1021
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,931
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown,

1022
01:05:03,184 --> 01:05:06,352
a charge that carries a
penalty of death by hanging.

1023
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:12,108
A sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing

1024
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:13,693
in this case.

1025
01:05:15,696 --> 01:05:17,322
I sentence you to life imprisonment

1026
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:20,450
and I instruct that you shall serve

1027
01:05:20,993 --> 01:05:23,578
A minimum of 30 years.

1028
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:26,956
Take him down.

1029
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,877
Come on, Son.

1030
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:40,011
Help me.

1031
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,898
Paul Michael Hill.

1032
01:05:54,527 --> 01:05:58,446
In my view, your crime is such that

1033
01:05:58,531 --> 01:05:59,989
life shall mean life.

1034
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:05,328
Annie Maguire, I recommend
you serve 14 years!

1035
01:06:05,412 --> 01:06:07,163
What have I done, for Christ's sake?

1036
01:06:07,248 --> 01:06:08,748
Take her down!

1037
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:10,750
Guiseppe Conlon, 12 years.

1038
01:06:10,835 --> 01:06:12,669
No! No, my
husband's innocent!

1039
01:06:12,753 --> 01:06:14,045
Lord have mercy on you!

1040
01:06:14,129 --> 01:06:17,048
Patrick Joseph Armstrong, 30 years.

1041
01:06:23,305 --> 01:06:26,391
Carole Richardson, 30 years.

1042
01:07:22,448 --> 01:07:24,157
Our case was so insane

1043
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,451
that if you made it up,
nobody would believe it.

1044
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:29,746
Look, Gareth, I know people say
that I'm a compulsive storyteller

1045
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,623
and nobody believed
a word I said in court,

1046
01:07:31,707 --> 01:07:34,000
but, Gareth, Charlie Burke did exist.

1047
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,419
He's not just a figment
of my imagination.

1048
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:42,175
Sorry.

1049
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,940
We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison,

1050
01:07:57,483 --> 01:08:01,444
an old Victorian fortress where the Britain's
most dangerous criminals were held

1051
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:03,738
in the maximum-security wing.

1052
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:06,032
- Place of birth.
- Belfast.

1053
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:07,659
Then you're British.

1054
01:08:07,743 --> 01:08:08,952
This is your home
for the rest of your life.

1055
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:11,454
So accept it and get on with it.
Right, come this way.

1056
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:13,164
The chief warder, Barker,

1057
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:16,292
gave us blue denim uniforms
with yellow stripes.

1058
01:08:16,377 --> 01:08:17,794
We were Category A,

1059
01:08:17,878 --> 01:08:21,381
the highest security class along
with the rapists and murderers.

1060
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:24,133
My father said
we'd fight for an appeal,

1061
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:26,052
but I didn't want to know
about the legal system.

1062
01:08:27,221 --> 01:08:28,388
I'm going back to the cell.

1063
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:30,223
Come on. Follow me.

1064
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:42,318
Come on, Gerry.

1065
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:46,906
Hey, Ronnie.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.

1066
01:08:49,368 --> 01:08:50,535
Irish scum.

1067
01:08:51,286 --> 01:08:53,621
My name's Guiseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man.

1068
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:55,164
So is my son.

1069
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,542
We shouldn't even be in here.

1070
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:59,377
Get that fucking scum off my floor.

1071
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:26,279
They must know they've made a mistake.

1072
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:27,905
No, they don't.

1073
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,534
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

1074
01:09:31,618 --> 01:09:33,077
We have to fight 'em to get an appeal.

1075
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:36,289
I'll speak to Father Wilson.

1076
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:38,374
Speak to everybody.

1077
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:41,461
We'll write letters from in here.
Start a campaign.

1078
01:09:42,755 --> 01:09:43,963
Have they been treating you all right?

1079
01:09:44,423 --> 01:09:45,798
Aye, fine. Fine.

1080
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:48,051
Have they, Son?

1081
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:51,387
Aye. No problem.

1082
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:11,074
Forgot the dessert spoons.

1083
01:10:12,701 --> 01:10:13,951
There we go.

1084
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:26,672
Mmm. These chips
are not bad.

1085
01:10:33,639 --> 01:10:35,098
Now don't you despair, Son.

1086
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:37,016
Never mind about
"don't despair."

1087
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,518
What?

1088
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:41,312
I mean, we're innocent, we
can't even go out of the cell.

1089
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:45,608
You're better off being guilty.

1090
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:47,819
At least you get some respect.

1091
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:52,031
Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.

1092
01:10:52,116 --> 01:10:53,991
Here, you can have my chips.

1093
01:10:54,201 --> 01:10:56,869
Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.

1094
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,702
Gerry, man.

1095
01:11:38,912 --> 01:11:40,830
Problem? You all right?

1096
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:45,918
How do you like your new home?

1097
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,172
Bombing of pillar-box,
Kensington High Street.

1098
01:11:49,256 --> 01:11:50,923
Bombing of pillar-box,
Talbot Lodge.

1099
01:11:51,466 --> 01:11:52,842
Bombing of naval club.

1100
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:54,510
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.

1101
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:55,887
Attempted murder of Edward Heath.

1102
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:58,472
Murder of Ross McWhirter.

1103
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:02,393
Possession of firearms, Balcombe
Street, December 6, 1975.

1104
01:12:02,728 --> 01:12:05,021
And the Guildford pub bombings.

1105
01:12:06,565 --> 01:12:09,358
You have innocent people
in jail for that.

1106
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:14,238
Take him out.

1107
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:39,305
He did it.

1108
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:42,475
Where's all the missing pieces?

1109
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:48,064
We eat it up, man.

1110
01:12:49,274 --> 01:12:52,860
Before my woman
send it in here, right,

1111
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:55,613
she have it dipped in liquid acid.

1112
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:57,990
LSD, man.

1113
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:02,036
We've been dropping the British
Empire for the last six months.

1114
01:13:02,204 --> 01:13:04,538
You want to fly?
Pick a country.

1115
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:06,082
Fuck's sake, don't give
me Northern Ireland.

1116
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,125
I don't want a bad trip.

1117
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,087
Try Nepal, man.
Take you to the Himalayas.

1118
01:13:28,146 --> 01:13:30,356
See the dragon.

1119
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,218
- Lights out in 15 minutes.
- Fifteen minutes.

1120
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:12,398
Are you praying
for the Seventh Cavalry?

1121
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:16,986
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1122
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:18,195
Blessed art thou amongst women,

1123
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,656
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1124
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:22,450
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

1125
01:14:22,576 --> 01:14:25,119
now and at the moment
of our death. Amen.

1126
01:14:25,203 --> 01:14:26,746
That's not funny, Gerry.

1127
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:31,250
Hail Mary, full of grace,

1128
01:14:32,252 --> 01:14:33,252
the Lord is with thee.

1129
01:14:35,047 --> 01:14:37,173
Blessed art thou among women

1130
01:14:37,257 --> 01:14:39,425
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1131
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:44,805
Holy Mary, mother of God,

1132
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:48,225
pray for us sinners, now and at
the hour of our death. Amen.

1133
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,144
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1134
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,778
Are you on drugs?

1135
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:15,211
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
now when I get out of this place.

1136
01:15:17,089 --> 01:15:18,547
If I get out.

1137
01:15:22,677 --> 01:15:23,803
Are you listening to me?

1138
01:15:24,471 --> 01:15:26,222
I'm not talking to you.

1139
01:15:26,807 --> 01:15:28,808
Now who's being childish?

1140
01:15:30,519 --> 01:15:33,979
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1141
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:36,941
That stuff will kill you.

1142
01:15:38,485 --> 01:15:40,361
Sure, I'm dead anyway.

1143
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,325
Look, I'm sorry.

1144
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:49,537
I'll not take it again
so long as you live.

1145
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:52,164
Are you happy now?

1146
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:55,418
No.

1147
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:57,962
Why not?

1148
01:16:01,174 --> 01:16:03,592
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1149
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:09,598
Jesus Christ.

1150
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:18,065
All right. I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1151
01:16:20,026 --> 01:16:21,694
Now are you happy?

1152
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:23,904
Is that a promise?

1153
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:29,034
Aye.

1154
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:31,912
Maybe.

1155
01:16:40,046 --> 01:16:42,548
Gerry, man, check out your friend.

1156
01:16:45,093 --> 01:16:46,760
He look like the real thing.

1157
01:16:51,183 --> 01:16:52,391
Come on.

1158
01:17:04,446 --> 01:17:06,363
Excuse me.
All right.

1159
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,619
Let's have a talk.

1160
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:17,708
We have to eat in the cells.

1161
01:17:18,877 --> 01:17:20,336
See ya later.

1162
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:24,131
Gerry. Gerry, come on.

1163
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:52,117
Morning, paddy.

1164
01:17:57,624 --> 01:17:58,707
Yes!

1165
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,008
Come on!

1166
01:18:08,927 --> 01:18:10,261
Yes, man, Gerry!

1167
01:18:21,022 --> 01:18:24,650
This one, this one, this one,
14 days solitary! Lock up!

1168
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:26,819
Lock up!

1169
01:18:27,654 --> 01:18:29,989
He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1170
01:18:40,584 --> 01:18:42,585
I'm worried about Bridie.

1171
01:18:45,213 --> 01:18:46,297
Why?

1172
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:50,175
She's dyed her hair blonde.

1173
01:18:52,137 --> 01:18:54,013
Well, she's only young.

1174
01:18:57,684 --> 01:18:59,810
She's wearing a dog collar.

1175
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,613
There's a fella chained to it.
He's got one on, too.

1176
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:15,492
Well...

1177
01:19:16,494 --> 01:19:18,370
As long as she's happy.

1178
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:31,216
Lunch break.

1179
01:19:33,928 --> 01:19:36,180
Yes, Gerry, man!
That's right!

1180
01:19:36,431 --> 01:19:38,098
Gerry's a bad boy!

1181
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:41,393
Put the Englishman on their
heavy, heavy manners.

1182
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:45,189
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1183
01:19:46,483 --> 01:19:49,276
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1184
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:50,694
Hello, Mr. Conlon.

1185
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:54,990
I'm watching you.

1186
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:07,961
What is it?

1187
01:20:08,922 --> 01:20:12,424
I'm the one who planted the
Guildford bomb, Mr. Conlon.

1188
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:17,680
Did you tell the police that?

1189
01:20:17,764 --> 01:20:19,098
Yes, I did.

1190
01:20:20,767 --> 01:20:21,892
But we haven't heard a thing.

1191
01:20:21,976 --> 01:20:23,936
Will you just wait and see
what he has to say, Da?

1192
01:20:25,146 --> 01:20:26,313
Go on.

1193
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:30,275
I told them. They know...
They know the truth.

1194
01:20:31,945 --> 01:20:34,113
They can't afford to face it.

1195
01:20:34,614 --> 01:20:37,866
It's a war.
You're one if its innocent victims.

1196
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:40,035
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1197
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,995
Don't be sorry for us.

1198
01:20:42,997 --> 01:20:44,540
You should be sorry
for the people you killed.

1199
01:20:46,418 --> 01:20:49,294
It was a military target,
a soldiers' pub.

1200
01:20:50,004 --> 01:20:53,841
They were innocent people,
God's children.

1201
01:20:54,426 --> 01:20:58,512
Look, I'll do all I can to
help you while you're in here.

1202
01:20:58,888 --> 01:20:59,972
We don't need your help.

1203
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:04,184
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us alone.

1204
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:07,271
Whatever you say.

1205
01:21:10,442 --> 01:21:12,234
I'm sorry about that.

1206
01:21:16,197 --> 01:21:17,948
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1207
01:21:18,324 --> 01:21:20,284
What? Manners to him?

1208
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:22,369
I don't want any part
of him, or his ways.

1209
01:21:22,454 --> 01:21:23,912
At least he stands up for himself.
At least he fights back,

1210
01:21:23,997 --> 01:21:25,164
which is more than you
ever did in your life.

1211
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,582
What are you talking about?

1212
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:28,333
Do you remember Lydon Hill?
Huh?

1213
01:21:29,002 --> 01:21:31,503
You used to ride me up on the
crossbar of your bike up Lydon Hill.

1214
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,464
And then one day you
couldn't make it to the top,

1215
01:21:33,548 --> 01:21:36,133
and I hopped off the crossbar,
and I looked back,

1216
01:21:36,217 --> 01:21:38,051
and your face was all red.

1217
01:21:38,136 --> 01:21:39,928
Remember that?
Aye.

1218
01:21:42,891 --> 01:21:45,476
It was working in the paint
shed done that to you.

1219
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,602
What?

1220
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:50,314
It was the fumes from working in
the paint shed done that to you.

1221
01:21:50,398 --> 01:21:52,858
Never mind jumping off the ferry
and swimming back to Mummy.

1222
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,777
It was the one job a Catholic can get,

1223
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:56,361
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1224
01:21:57,155 --> 01:21:58,655
Go on outside.

1225
01:21:59,783 --> 01:22:01,450
Play with your newfound friend.

1226
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:04,119
Look, all I'm saying is that you've
been a victim all your life.

1227
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:05,871
It's about time
you started to fight back.

1228
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:07,581
Get out of my sight.
I'm going.

1229
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:14,171
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternative.

1230
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:32,523
Well, what are you doing?

1231
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:33,690
Nothing.

1232
01:22:35,485 --> 01:22:37,152
They didn't do it.

1233
01:22:37,237 --> 01:22:38,237
They all did it.

1234
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:44,034
I'm going back to Belfast.

1235
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:52,251
After the fight, nobody stopped us

1236
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:54,378
going out in the yard to exercise.

1237
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,088
I felt brilliant.

1238
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,673
Joe explained things to me.

1239
01:22:57,757 --> 01:23:00,843
He explained how the Brits never
left anywhere without a fight.

1240
01:23:00,927 --> 01:23:04,388
How they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied.

1241
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:07,683
How this prison was just
an extension of their system.

1242
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:10,352
Calling for work on the threes.

1243
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:13,856
We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.

1244
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,023
Mr. Smalls.

1245
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:17,943
But to do that, we had to
take care of Ronnie Smalls.

1246
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,904
Can I have a word
about 54, Halsley Road?

1247
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:26,076
Take a walk.

1248
01:23:34,294 --> 01:23:37,170
If anything happens to me or Gerry

1249
01:23:38,548 --> 01:23:40,674
or any other Irish prisoner,

1250
01:23:41,509 --> 01:23:45,220
we'll have 54, Halsley Road
blown to smithereens

1251
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:47,806
with your family in it.

1252
01:23:49,809 --> 01:23:52,477
Threaten my family and I'll
cut your fucking head off.

1253
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,774
I don't make threats.

1254
01:23:57,859 --> 01:23:59,818
I just carry out orders.

1255
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,862
I don't want to hurt your family.

1256
01:24:07,118 --> 01:24:10,704
Your trouble is, Joe, you want
to rule the fucking world.

1257
01:24:12,624 --> 01:24:13,749
Paddy's all right.

1258
01:24:25,595 --> 01:24:28,388
Soon, we were all one happy family.

1259
01:24:28,514 --> 01:24:29,556
Again!

1260
01:24:29,641 --> 01:24:31,975
Even Kojak was ready to forgive.

1261
01:24:32,226 --> 01:24:33,560
Live and let live.

1262
01:24:33,686 --> 01:24:34,937
Barker began to panic.

1263
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,814
He told us to take our socks
out of the window.

1264
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:40,442
He thought we were signaling
to other prisoners.

1265
01:24:40,735 --> 01:24:43,487
We're not signaling.
We're drying our socks out.

1266
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:45,322
Take the socks out of the window.
Who says?

1267
01:24:45,657 --> 01:24:46,823
Mr. Barker.

1268
01:24:46,908 --> 01:24:49,201
That was all the excuse Joe needed.

1269
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:50,535
Give us two minutes.

1270
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:53,163
- Hey, up and away we went.
- Are you with me?

1271
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:54,581
What's he up to now?

1272
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:00,796
All prison officers
to vacate the wing.

1273
01:25:01,172 --> 01:25:03,298
All officers vacate the wing!

1274
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:11,181
This'll damage the whole campaign.

1275
01:25:11,265 --> 01:25:13,684
Look, you do it your way, and
we'll do it ours, all right?

1276
01:25:13,893 --> 01:25:15,310
You can read our demands.

1277
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:17,562
Go back to your cells.

1278
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:19,231
Blankets!

1279
01:25:19,899 --> 01:25:21,817
For God's sake, put a stop to this.

1280
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:23,735
You're weakening
my position, Guiseppe.

1281
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,696
It will end in violence.
Good.

1282
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,947
What's good about it?

1283
01:25:27,031 --> 01:25:28,115
It's all they understand.

1284
01:25:31,202 --> 01:25:33,161
Barker refused to negotiate.

1285
01:25:33,246 --> 01:25:35,455
But with the screws gone,
we'd a brief taste of freedom.

1286
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,748
Check out Ronnie!

1287
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:40,252
Him swallow half Africa.

1288
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:43,463
I give him about an hour.

1289
01:25:50,054 --> 01:25:52,723
We found out later
our protest got on TV.

1290
01:25:53,391 --> 01:25:55,267
And that's when the riot
squad was ordered in.

1291
01:25:57,895 --> 01:25:58,979
Shh!

1292
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:13,118
We were singled out
as the ringleaders.

1293
01:26:13,453 --> 01:26:14,494
Now!

1294
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:42,147
You just signed your own
death warrant, Barker.

1295
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:48,111
Are you happy now?

1296
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:54,534
And then you arrived, Gareth.

1297
01:26:54,786 --> 01:26:58,914
That's the first time I saw you,
under a raining shower of sparks.

1298
01:26:58,998 --> 01:27:02,876
It was the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.

1299
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,212
But to me, you were a lawyer first.

1300
01:27:05,296 --> 01:27:06,505
And I hated lawyers.

1301
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:07,923
And do you have a new isolation room?

1302
01:27:08,007 --> 01:27:09,674
Prisoners!

1303
01:27:10,093 --> 01:27:11,927
Bert, Andrew.

1304
01:27:12,178 --> 01:27:15,347
Bailey, Benjamin.
McAndrew, Joseph.

1305
01:27:15,431 --> 01:27:17,849
Sorry. Can you... I can't hear.
Conlon, Gerard.

1306
01:27:18,226 --> 01:27:19,893
O'Brien, John.

1307
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,939
Lynch, Bernard.
Crisp, Quincy.

1308
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:27,150
Lyon, Richard.
Burns, Delrow.

1309
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,902
What about Conlon?

1310
01:27:28,986 --> 01:27:31,071
Sorry. Guiseppe Conlon.

1311
01:27:31,697 --> 01:27:33,323
He's on the third floor.

1312
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:37,035
He has difficulty
getting down the stairs.

1313
01:27:38,538 --> 01:27:41,081
Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.

1314
01:27:41,165 --> 01:27:43,708
The delegation has seen enough.
Right-o. Sorry.

1315
01:27:44,043 --> 01:27:47,045
Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just...
Is that all right? Sorry.

1316
01:27:48,089 --> 01:27:50,507
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Sorry.

1317
01:27:57,306 --> 01:27:58,473
Sorry, I can't...

1318
01:27:58,558 --> 01:27:59,724
Pulmonary thrombosis.

1319
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:01,143
Uh-huh. And you're
getting medication...

1320
01:28:01,227 --> 01:28:02,310
He's getting proper medication?

1321
01:28:02,395 --> 01:28:03,478
Are you? Yes?

1322
01:28:04,063 --> 01:28:05,063
Uh-huh.

1323
01:28:08,901 --> 01:28:09,901
Son?

1324
01:28:10,403 --> 01:28:11,570
Gerry!

1325
01:28:12,738 --> 01:28:14,614
That's... Is it Gerry?

1326
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:15,949
That's Gerry.
Uh-huh.

1327
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:18,368
He's had a spot of bother
with lawyers in the past.

1328
01:28:22,415 --> 01:28:24,916
He's all yours.
Fifteen minutes.

1329
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,043
Thank you.
Sit down.

1330
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:36,011
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1331
01:28:57,074 --> 01:28:59,367
Why are you giving
my father false hope?

1332
01:29:00,203 --> 01:29:01,369
Sorry?

1333
01:29:02,205 --> 01:29:04,456
He's been up and down these stairs
every couple of weeks to see you.

1334
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,333
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1335
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:09,586
Oh, I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1336
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,796
Yes. She's a very
brave woman.

1337
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,715
Aye, you don't know the half of it.

1338
01:29:16,928 --> 01:29:18,303
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1339
01:29:19,055 --> 01:29:21,139
It's not the stairs that are
killing your father, Gerry.

1340
01:29:21,641 --> 01:29:22,974
Why, what is it, then?

1341
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:24,351
It's your lack of faith.

1342
01:29:25,144 --> 01:29:27,395
Lack of faith?
Faith in what?

1343
01:29:28,022 --> 01:29:29,189
In yourself.

1344
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:32,025
No, I have faith in myself.

1345
01:29:33,486 --> 01:29:37,155
Gerry Conlon, lifer,
30-year sentence.

1346
01:29:37,615 --> 01:29:39,199
And I know how to survive it.
No problem.

1347
01:29:40,993 --> 01:29:42,160
At what price?

1348
01:29:42,495 --> 01:29:44,579
I'll pay the fucking price.
Don't you worry about it.

1349
01:29:45,498 --> 01:29:47,249
The price for what?

1350
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:48,583
Right.

1351
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:52,045
You're very good at the
English, aren't you?

1352
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:55,715
You see, I don't understand
your language.

1353
01:29:57,635 --> 01:30:00,720
Justice. Mercy. Clemency.

1354
01:30:01,347 --> 01:30:04,599
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1355
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:08,103
You see, I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1356
01:30:08,187 --> 01:30:09,938
And that way I could put
my fist in my mouth

1357
01:30:10,022 --> 01:30:12,649
and never speak another word of
fuckin' English so long as I live...

1358
01:30:12,733 --> 01:30:14,859
Do you see what I'm saying, Miss Peirce?
Mrs. Peirce, is it?

1359
01:30:15,903 --> 01:30:17,404
Are you trying to impress me?

1360
01:30:19,573 --> 01:30:20,865
Visit's up.

1361
01:30:21,534 --> 01:30:24,369
Don't give my father
false hope, all right?

1362
01:30:24,662 --> 01:30:26,371
Gerry!

1363
01:30:27,707 --> 01:30:29,374
Well, you've got to help him!

1364
01:30:31,752 --> 01:30:34,796
In prison, you pray for
anything to break the monotony.

1365
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,549
A snowstorm is like
a present from God.

1366
01:30:42,888 --> 01:30:44,055
Whoo!

1367
01:30:46,976 --> 01:30:48,560
Stop!

1368
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:49,978
Prison officers are not to be hit!

1369
01:30:50,896 --> 01:30:52,564
All right, you lot,
you've asked for it.

1370
01:30:52,898 --> 01:30:54,399
Come along!

1371
01:30:55,234 --> 01:30:58,111
After the riot, my father's
health deteriorated badly.

1372
01:30:58,696 --> 01:31:01,656
He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.

1373
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:05,118
I waved up to him, but he was
looking at something else.

1374
01:31:15,379 --> 01:31:17,380
My da always saw the good in people.

1375
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,259
He recognized it in you the
minute he saw you, Gareth.

1376
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:23,011
Guv, guv, where you going?

1377
01:31:23,095 --> 01:31:25,430
Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1378
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,894
Thank you.

1379
01:31:35,358 --> 01:31:38,234
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Guiseppe.

1380
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:39,736
What's that?

1381
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:47,827
How'd you come by that name?

1382
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:51,373
What?
An Italian ice cream maker.

1383
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:54,918
Had a shop on the corner of
the street where I was born.

1384
01:31:55,002 --> 01:31:56,544
Guiseppe Fosco.

1385
01:31:57,338 --> 01:31:59,881
My mother fell in love with the name.

1386
01:31:59,965 --> 01:32:01,132
Were they...

1387
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:04,219
You know.
What?

1388
01:32:05,638 --> 01:32:07,222
Lovers.
Who?

1389
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,224
My mother and the Italian
ice cream maker?

1390
01:32:10,309 --> 01:32:12,185
Oh, no, God.

1391
01:32:12,269 --> 01:32:14,687
Jesus, no.
No, they were not.

1392
01:32:15,815 --> 01:32:17,941
No, she just liked the name.

1393
01:32:19,235 --> 01:32:21,236
But it made my life hell.

1394
01:32:21,821 --> 01:32:24,489
All the other children
laughing at you.

1395
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,117
You have any kids yourself?

1396
01:32:30,162 --> 01:32:31,496
He's talking to Barker now.

1397
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,958
Forget it, Joe. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1398
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,003
Two.

1399
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,549
Flown the nest now.

1400
01:32:59,859 --> 01:33:01,693
Whether Barker was responsible or not

1401
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:05,029
for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.

1402
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,533
Joe was still at war.

1403
01:33:08,617 --> 01:33:10,952
And to him, Barker was the enemy.

1404
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:14,164
Number?

1405
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,124
The name is McAndrew.

1406
01:33:18,169 --> 01:33:20,253
Get out... Get out of the
way, out of the light.

1407
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:22,964
Get out of the light.

1408
01:33:23,048 --> 01:33:24,007
Number?

1409
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:25,508
Name's Gerry Conlon.

1410
01:33:27,803 --> 01:33:29,721
Piss off out of the light.
Get out of the light!

1411
01:33:30,264 --> 01:33:31,639
You're 136.

1412
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:39,689
There's someone sitting there.

1413
01:33:41,942 --> 01:33:44,277
Move when you're told.

1414
01:33:50,367 --> 01:33:51,493
Put it out.

1415
01:34:22,107 --> 01:34:23,233
How's your boy?

1416
01:34:23,317 --> 01:34:24,400
He's good.

1417
01:34:24,485 --> 01:34:27,237
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1418
01:34:27,947 --> 01:34:29,822
He's smarter than I am.

1419
01:34:30,407 --> 01:34:31,950
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1420
01:34:32,117 --> 01:34:34,118
There's a hair
in the fucking projector!

1421
01:34:34,328 --> 01:34:37,080
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out the projector, will you?

1422
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:40,083
Come on. Get it out!

1423
01:34:40,459 --> 01:34:41,584
Get it out!

1424
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:46,923
I'm going fucking blind up here, guv.
Lively!

1425
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:55,265
We'll get there, Pop.
Quiet.

1426
01:34:55,349 --> 01:34:57,267
I didn't say a fucking thing.
You're blocking.

1427
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:58,601
Shut it.

1428
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:14,242
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this.

1429
01:35:15,327 --> 01:35:17,579
And Fredo, well...

1430
01:35:19,623 --> 01:35:21,207
Fredo was wrong.

1431
01:35:23,335 --> 01:35:26,170
And I never...
I never wanted this for you.

1432
01:35:29,258 --> 01:35:30,341
Oi, you!

1433
01:35:59,496 --> 01:36:02,415
Barker! Move back, Barker!

1434
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:03,958
Get in there!

1435
01:36:04,043 --> 01:36:05,501
Get it out!

1436
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:28,483
Stretcher!

1437
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:29,651
Let's check this out.

1438
01:36:30,069 --> 01:36:32,070
All right, mate.
You're with us.

1439
01:36:32,154 --> 01:36:33,696
All right. Stretcher!

1440
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:36,616
Gently, now.

1441
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:38,493
Come on, up!

1442
01:36:39,536 --> 01:36:41,704
That was a good day's work, McAndrew.

1443
01:36:42,539 --> 01:36:43,831
That was a good day's work.

1444
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:46,084
Get away from me.

1445
01:36:46,919 --> 01:36:49,253
Will you not look me in the
eye when I'm speaking to you?

1446
01:36:52,049 --> 01:36:54,926
See, I know how to look at
people without blinking as well.

1447
01:36:58,764 --> 01:37:01,182
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known

1448
01:37:01,266 --> 01:37:04,560
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1449
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:09,816
You're a brave man, Joe, a brave man.

1450
01:37:12,611 --> 01:37:15,029
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1451
01:37:15,447 --> 01:37:16,406
Stand your ground.

1452
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:19,158
Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1453
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:21,577
Benjamin Bailey, back to his cell!

1454
01:37:22,204 --> 01:37:24,163
Benjamin Bailey,
returning to his cell.

1455
01:37:24,248 --> 01:37:26,791
7445, Casey, back to his cell.

1456
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:29,419
6309, Johnston, level three.

1457
01:37:29,795 --> 01:37:32,630
Regis, 113, going up to number two.

1458
01:37:50,274 --> 01:37:52,358
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1459
01:37:53,485 --> 01:37:55,236
Barker was maimed for life

1460
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,739
and Joe was sent to another prison.

1461
01:37:58,157 --> 01:37:59,824
He's in solitary confinement
somewhere.

1462
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:02,452
We've had no news of him since then.

1463
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,371
The new chief screw
had the yard painted

1464
01:38:05,456 --> 01:38:07,373
and I was back
walking in circles again.

1465
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:09,125
Back to the cells.

1466
01:38:11,211 --> 01:38:12,712
Come on. Move.

1467
01:38:41,325 --> 01:38:44,118
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da...

1468
01:38:45,746 --> 01:38:47,955
If that's all right with you.

1469
01:38:48,582 --> 01:38:49,916
Do you mean it?

1470
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:51,626
Aye.

1471
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,128
That's great.

1472
01:38:54,588 --> 01:38:56,923
Okay, Gerry, what I need
from you is the whole story,

1473
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:59,926
your whole story, in as much
detail as you can remember.

1474
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,386
Every detail you can think of,
and I need you to write it down.

1475
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:04,388
It's really important.

1476
01:39:10,771 --> 01:39:12,396
I can't do this.

1477
01:39:15,067 --> 01:39:16,442
I can't write this, Da.

1478
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:18,319
Could your son not give you a hand?

1479
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:21,405
Nah. He's up in his
cell writing away.

1480
01:39:26,829 --> 01:39:27,912
Okay.

1481
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,044
Tape recorder.

1482
01:39:35,128 --> 01:39:37,421
You're...
You're a good talker.

1483
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:39,090
Talk.

1484
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:42,677
The strange thing is...

1485
01:39:44,096 --> 01:39:46,180
The strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a little jealous

1486
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:48,933
of me taking over
the campaign and that there.

1487
01:39:49,017 --> 01:39:51,769
Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.

1488
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:55,356
That's something I never
thought about Guiseppe,

1489
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,441
that he could be jealous.

1490
01:39:59,111 --> 01:40:02,363
Anyhow, the main thing is
to get the case reopened

1491
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,617
because I don't know how long
he can survive in here.

1492
01:40:23,802 --> 01:40:25,177
I'm tired of this.

1493
01:40:26,054 --> 01:40:27,680
Come on. We have to do this.
Come on.

1494
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:29,265
You behave yourself.

1495
01:40:33,645 --> 01:40:34,770
Get your head down.

1496
01:40:42,154 --> 01:40:45,364
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1497
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:47,033
And one day when you and Ma were out,

1498
01:40:47,117 --> 01:40:48,868
I got a big bowl of boiling water,

1499
01:40:48,952 --> 01:40:52,288
whacked a big drop of Vicks and
then put the towel over my head.

1500
01:40:52,372 --> 01:40:53,998
And then I sat there trying to
figure out what it was all about

1501
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:56,334
'cause nothing was happening.

1502
01:40:56,418 --> 01:40:58,377
And then I figured you must've been drinking it.
Do you remember that?

1503
01:40:58,462 --> 01:41:00,338
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1504
01:41:03,675 --> 01:41:05,426
How could I forget?

1505
01:41:06,428 --> 01:41:09,347
And your tongue
swelled up like a football.

1506
01:41:10,515 --> 01:41:12,475
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1507
01:41:12,559 --> 01:41:14,769
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1508
01:41:18,023 --> 01:41:19,023
Give us that.

1509
01:41:21,026 --> 01:41:23,319
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1510
01:41:31,161 --> 01:41:32,536
Was I always bad, was I?

1511
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:35,289
Not always.

1512
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:38,167
I don't deserve to spend the
rest of my life in here, do I?

1513
01:41:39,211 --> 01:41:42,129
All they've done
is block out the light.

1514
01:41:42,214 --> 01:41:43,673
They can't block out
the light in here.

1515
01:41:44,549 --> 01:41:45,758
Listen.

1516
01:41:46,051 --> 01:41:47,551
Every night...

1517
01:41:47,678 --> 01:41:49,845
I take your mother's hand in mine.

1518
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:52,640
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street,

1519
01:41:54,351 --> 01:41:57,269
down to Falls Road, up the Antrim Road

1520
01:41:59,064 --> 01:42:00,564
to Cave Hill.

1521
01:42:01,108 --> 01:42:02,900
We look back down

1522
01:42:05,153 --> 01:42:06,988
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1523
01:42:10,492 --> 01:42:13,327
I've been doing that every night

1524
01:42:13,412 --> 01:42:15,121
for five years now.

1525
01:42:17,082 --> 01:42:19,375
As if I never left your mother.

1526
01:42:29,302 --> 01:42:31,887
What I remember most
about my childhood is,

1527
01:42:31,972 --> 01:42:33,639
holding your hand.

1528
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,392
My wee hand in your big hand.

1529
01:42:36,643 --> 01:42:39,353
And the smell of tobacco.
I remember that...

1530
01:42:39,438 --> 01:42:42,732
I could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand.

1531
01:42:45,944 --> 01:42:50,031
When I want to feel happy, I try
to remember the smell of tobacco.

1532
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:54,994
Hold my hand.

1533
01:42:55,537 --> 01:42:57,747
Get the fuck...

1534
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,916
Now, don't go sentimental on me now.

1535
01:43:01,918 --> 01:43:05,546
Don't be upset, Da.
Look, I'll hold your hand if you like.

1536
01:43:08,008 --> 01:43:09,633
I'm going to die.

1537
01:43:11,053 --> 01:43:12,845
Don't be saying that.

1538
01:43:13,847 --> 01:43:15,222
I'm scared.

1539
01:43:17,392 --> 01:43:18,559
You've no reason to be scared.

1540
01:43:18,643 --> 01:43:19,852
You have nothing to be scared about.

1541
01:43:19,936 --> 01:43:24,482
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1542
01:43:24,566 --> 01:43:27,985
I'm scared I'm gonna die here
among strangers.

1543
01:43:28,153 --> 01:43:29,570
You're not fucking dying, all right.

1544
01:43:30,614 --> 01:43:34,325
Can I not say a thing without
you fucking contradicting me?

1545
01:43:35,202 --> 01:43:39,288
I'm scared to leave
your mother behind.

1546
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:44,877
Look, you are not
going to die, all right, Da?

1547
01:43:47,672 --> 01:43:50,966
Even if you do, sure I can
look after Ma all right.

1548
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,303
You think I'd leave
Sarah in your care?

1549
01:43:55,847 --> 01:43:57,473
What do you mean?

1550
01:43:58,016 --> 01:44:01,519
You haven't the maturity to take care
of yourself, let alone your mother.

1551
01:44:08,944 --> 01:44:11,028
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs. Peirce.

1552
01:44:11,822 --> 01:44:13,781
How can I help you?
Thank you.

1553
01:44:13,865 --> 01:44:17,159
I'm the solicitor for the
Conlons, Chief Inspector.

1554
01:44:17,369 --> 01:44:20,871
Guiseppe Conlon is critically
ill, as you may know.

1555
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,624
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1556
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:25,709
They want your clearance.

1557
01:44:26,419 --> 01:44:28,129
That'll be difficult,
Mrs. Peirce.

1558
01:44:28,213 --> 01:44:31,173
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1559
01:44:32,259 --> 01:44:33,968
Society demands
that they serve their time.

1560
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,555
But they didn't do it,
Chief Inspector.

1561
01:44:37,806 --> 01:44:39,056
Says who?

1562
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:41,600
Say the real bombers.

1563
01:44:41,893 --> 01:44:44,186
They told you they did it,
Mr. Dixon.

1564
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:47,022
Gerry Conlon told me he did it, Mrs.
Peirce.

1565
01:44:47,107 --> 01:44:49,024
These people are liars.

1566
01:44:49,776 --> 01:44:52,153
They're liars for a cause.
That's the worst kind.

1567
01:44:52,571 --> 01:44:54,530
But he's dying.
Guiseppe's dying.

1568
01:44:54,614 --> 01:44:57,491
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1569
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,123
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1570
01:45:04,749 --> 01:45:06,292
Is this your family,
Mr. Dixon?

1571
01:45:07,711 --> 01:45:09,378
That's my wife and my son.

1572
01:45:10,088 --> 01:45:12,173
You have another appointment.

1573
01:45:12,257 --> 01:45:13,340
Yes.

1574
01:45:15,385 --> 01:45:17,595
I'll see you again,
Mr. Dixon.

1575
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:55,966
Are you all right, Da?

1576
01:46:03,099 --> 01:46:04,141
Da?

1577
01:46:09,356 --> 01:46:11,023
Are you all right?

1578
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:15,986
Wake up, Da. Da?

1579
01:46:16,613 --> 01:46:19,657
Da, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Guiseppe?

1580
01:46:21,368 --> 01:46:23,077
Come on, dear God in heaven,
don't do this to me.

1581
01:46:23,161 --> 01:46:24,745
Come on. Wake up.

1582
01:46:24,829 --> 01:46:26,080
Wake up!
Fuck's sake, come on!

1583
01:46:26,164 --> 01:46:27,373
Come on, come on, wake up!

1584
01:46:27,457 --> 01:46:28,415
There you go.
Thank you, God.

1585
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,875
You're all right, Da.
You're all right.

1586
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,543
You're all right, Da.
I'm going to get some help.

1587
01:46:31,628 --> 01:46:33,045
I'm going to get some help, all right?

1588
01:46:33,129 --> 01:46:34,338
Number 73! Number 73!

1589
01:46:35,507 --> 01:46:37,883
Please come quickly!
My father's sick!

1590
01:46:37,968 --> 01:46:39,468
Benbay, Guiseppe's taken bad!

1591
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:41,136
Da! Da!
Put your arms around me.

1592
01:46:41,221 --> 01:46:42,304
I'm getting you out of bed.

1593
01:46:42,389 --> 01:46:44,348
Come on, put your arms around me.
That's it, come on.

1594
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:45,891
It's Conlon!

1595
01:46:47,185 --> 01:46:48,310
Open the fucking door!

1596
01:46:48,395 --> 01:46:49,520
He's number 73!

1597
01:46:49,604 --> 01:46:50,604
Open the fucking door!

1598
01:46:50,689 --> 01:46:51,730
Guiseppe!

1599
01:46:52,983 --> 01:46:55,651
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1600
01:46:56,111 --> 01:46:57,194
He can't breathe!

1601
01:46:57,279 --> 01:46:59,655
Look, my father's fucking dying!

1602
01:47:00,156 --> 01:47:01,448
He needs oxygen!

1603
01:47:01,533 --> 01:47:03,284
Give him a fucking break!

1604
01:47:03,368 --> 01:47:04,702
Open the fucking gate!

1605
01:47:04,786 --> 01:47:06,120
I'm right here, Da.
I'm right here.

1606
01:47:06,204 --> 01:47:07,830
Get him in here!
Get him in here!

1607
01:47:07,872 --> 01:47:09,873
- What the fuck is going on?
- Stay where you are.

1608
01:47:14,879 --> 01:47:16,297
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1609
01:47:16,381 --> 01:47:17,840
Look, I want to go with him.
Please, can I go with him?

1610
01:47:17,924 --> 01:47:19,508
Boss, I'd like to go with him.

1611
01:47:19,592 --> 01:47:22,761
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1612
01:47:22,846 --> 01:47:25,055
You're gonna be all right, Da!

1613
01:47:25,265 --> 01:47:26,849
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

1614
01:47:26,933 --> 01:47:28,058
Take him back to his cell.

1615
01:47:34,316 --> 01:47:37,568
Leave him alone, you bastards!
Just let him be!

1616
01:48:00,342 --> 01:48:01,967
He's still awake.

1617
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:19,068
Your father passed away an hour ago.

1618
01:48:20,278 --> 01:48:22,029
Thank you very much.

1619
01:48:24,449 --> 01:48:25,783
I'm sorry.

1620
01:48:57,732 --> 01:48:59,608
Guiseppe is dead, man!

1621
01:49:00,318 --> 01:49:02,069
They kill Guiseppe!

1622
01:49:08,827 --> 01:49:09,910
Gerry, man!

1623
01:49:12,831 --> 01:49:14,164
Gerry!

1624
01:49:14,999 --> 01:49:16,792
They killed Guiseppe!

1625
01:50:05,383 --> 01:50:08,177
Well, I think they ought to
take the word "compassion"

1626
01:50:08,428 --> 01:50:10,679
out of the English dictionary.

1627
01:50:13,349 --> 01:50:15,559
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1628
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:21,982
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1629
01:50:23,193 --> 01:50:26,612
Believe me, if there's one thing I
know about, it's guilt, you know.

1630
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:31,283
Keep looking 'em in the eye,
and it's gonna reveal itself.

1631
01:50:31,493 --> 01:50:33,911
You have to keep up the pressure.

1632
01:50:36,789 --> 01:50:38,707
Do what you have to do.

1633
01:50:40,627 --> 01:50:42,586
Free the Four! Free the Four!

1634
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:46,465
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1635
01:51:02,273 --> 01:51:05,150
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1636
01:51:08,988 --> 01:51:11,615
"The Parade of Innocence."
What do you think?

1637
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:13,784
Thousands of people lined
the streets of Dublin,

1638
01:51:13,868 --> 01:51:16,161
London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations

1639
01:51:16,246 --> 01:51:17,871
demanding the release
of the Guildford Four.

1640
01:51:18,414 --> 01:51:19,748
Questions have been raised...

1641
01:51:19,832 --> 01:51:21,208
Say good night to Daddy, darling.

1642
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:22,459
Good night, Dad.

1643
01:51:22,544 --> 01:51:23,627
Good night, Son.

1644
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:27,756
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1645
01:51:30,134 --> 01:51:31,593
Mr. Dixon!

1646
01:51:38,643 --> 01:51:40,352
This was a mistake.

1647
01:51:41,729 --> 01:51:43,522
Why don't we let her see the files?

1648
01:51:43,606 --> 01:51:45,482
What harm could it do?

1649
01:51:46,943 --> 01:51:48,318
Mr. Dixon!

1650
01:51:48,403 --> 01:51:49,820
Yes? You never get tired of this
sort of thing? What's that?

1651
01:51:49,904 --> 01:51:53,657
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Guiseppe Conlon case files.

1652
01:51:56,995 --> 01:51:57,995
Good morning.

1653
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:00,122
There are a few rules to be observed.

1654
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:04,376
Here's a complete list of the
Conlon, Guiseppe case files,

1655
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,253
the only files you'll need to see.

1656
01:52:06,337 --> 01:52:08,505
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1657
01:52:09,007 --> 01:52:10,757
You'll open it in front of
me, take a page at a time,

1658
01:52:10,842 --> 01:52:12,509
read it, and then return it.

1659
01:52:12,594 --> 01:52:14,636
Is there a problem,
Mr. Dixon?

1660
01:52:14,762 --> 01:52:16,305
Problem?
Not at all, Mrs. Peirce.

1661
01:52:16,389 --> 01:52:19,850
Our chief archivist, Mr.
Jenkins, is here to assist you.

1662
01:52:20,852 --> 01:52:23,145
If you want to make a photocopy,
I and I alone will do it,

1663
01:52:23,229 --> 01:52:25,439
and you use this pen
at all times for any notes.

1664
01:52:25,523 --> 01:52:26,481
Why?

1665
01:52:26,566 --> 01:52:27,733
If you deface or alter any document,

1666
01:52:27,817 --> 01:52:29,818
we'll be able to trace it through
the ink type in this pen.

1667
01:52:30,278 --> 01:52:34,531
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs. Peirce.

1668
01:52:34,741 --> 01:52:36,700
We wouldn't want
police intelligence files

1669
01:52:36,784 --> 01:52:39,620
leaked to the IRA now, would we?

1670
01:52:42,707 --> 01:52:44,791
Conlon, Guiseppe file.

1671
01:52:44,876 --> 01:52:46,168
Yes, sir.

1672
01:52:59,474 --> 01:53:00,807
Might as well leave my kit on the bus,

1673
01:53:00,892 --> 01:53:02,434
'cause I'm not staying in your jail.

1674
01:53:02,518 --> 01:53:05,437
So, our new VIP prisoner.

1675
01:53:06,064 --> 01:53:07,189
Welcome to Scotland.

1676
01:53:07,273 --> 01:53:09,274
I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1677
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:11,193
He died in one of your jails.

1678
01:53:11,277 --> 01:53:12,986
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1679
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:14,988
They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break up my campaign.

1680
01:53:15,073 --> 01:53:16,323
Put him in solitary.

1681
01:53:16,407 --> 01:53:17,532
This is a peaceful protest.

1682
01:53:17,617 --> 01:53:19,034
I'm not observing prison rules.

1683
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:20,535
We'll teach you manners.

1684
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,329
Better men than you
have tried that already.

1685
01:53:22,664 --> 01:53:24,998
Your Honor, I have not seen
my client for two months.

1686
01:53:25,083 --> 01:53:26,291
He's been moved to Scotland,

1687
01:53:26,376 --> 01:53:29,169
which has seriously impeded my
investigation into his case,

1688
01:53:29,253 --> 01:53:32,422
so I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access...

1689
01:53:32,757 --> 01:53:34,508
Free the Four! Free the Four!

1690
01:53:34,592 --> 01:53:35,592
Free the Four!

1691
01:53:50,441 --> 01:53:51,858
Thanks a lot.
Good day.

1692
01:53:51,943 --> 01:53:53,819
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1693
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:14,423
Sorry. Could you copy that
for me, please?

1694
01:54:15,299 --> 01:54:16,633
Thank you.

1695
01:54:27,353 --> 01:54:30,522
I just want my mother to be happy.

1696
01:54:32,316 --> 01:54:34,151
I'd like her to know

1697
01:54:34,819 --> 01:54:38,196
that Guiseppe talked about
her every day of his life.

1698
01:54:40,908 --> 01:54:42,826
He missed her terribly.

1699
01:54:47,665 --> 01:54:49,833
It's strange to be in
a cell without him.

1700
01:54:53,337 --> 01:54:55,881
I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.

1701
01:54:55,965 --> 01:54:58,175
Everywhere I look, I see him.

1702
01:55:05,141 --> 01:55:08,935
Strange what time does
when you're in prison.

1703
01:55:11,689 --> 01:55:14,191
Like, you can be staring at the wall.

1704
01:55:15,526 --> 01:55:18,320
Drip, drip, drip.

1705
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:21,615
It takes an eternity.

1706
01:55:21,699 --> 01:55:24,868
And then you blink, and
three years have gone by.

1707
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,167
I mean, what I'm trying to...

1708
01:55:32,251 --> 01:55:35,212
I don't know what the fuck
I'm trying to say.

1709
01:55:37,882 --> 01:55:40,884
But I can't forget
what they did to my family.

1710
01:55:42,595 --> 01:55:44,387
I just can't forget.

1711
01:56:33,312 --> 01:56:34,563
Morning.

1712
01:56:35,815 --> 01:56:37,107
Where's Jenkins?

1713
01:56:37,191 --> 01:56:38,441
He telephoned in sick.

1714
01:56:38,526 --> 01:56:40,527
I'm afraid you're going to
have to come back tomorrow.

1715
01:56:40,611 --> 01:56:42,445
No, no, I can't.
I've got a case in court tomorrow.

1716
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:43,613
There's just too much to get through.

1717
01:56:43,698 --> 01:56:45,073
Well, I can't help you.

1718
01:56:45,324 --> 01:56:46,992
Please. Look,
I've got a court order.

1719
01:56:47,076 --> 01:56:49,536
You saw what Mr. Jenkins did.
You just bring me the files.

1720
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:52,038
I'll take the notes and give them
straight back to you. Please.

1721
01:56:52,206 --> 01:56:53,206
What name is it?

1722
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:54,291
Conlon.

1723
01:56:55,126 --> 01:56:57,961
All right. Thanks.
Thank you very much. Cheers.

1724
01:57:04,218 --> 01:57:05,760
What name was that again?

1725
01:57:05,845 --> 01:57:06,970
Conlon.

1726
01:57:07,388 --> 01:57:09,431
Well, we've got two Conlon boxes.

1727
01:57:09,515 --> 01:57:13,310
Is it Guiseppe Conlon
or Gerard Conlon?

1728
01:57:15,354 --> 01:57:16,563
Gerard.

1729
01:57:24,363 --> 01:57:26,156
Well, that's the start of them.

1730
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:49,512
Fuck 'em!

1731
01:57:50,556 --> 01:57:52,015
Fuck 'em!

1732
01:57:52,516 --> 01:57:54,434
It's good news, Gerry.

1733
01:57:54,852 --> 01:57:57,687
We're talking about
a piece of evidence

1734
01:57:58,439 --> 01:58:00,190
that says they knew all along,

1735
01:58:00,274 --> 01:58:01,900
that they let my father die in prison?

1736
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:04,861
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that, Gareth?

1737
01:58:05,363 --> 01:58:06,696
We'll get them in court.

1738
01:58:07,156 --> 01:58:08,281
"We'll get them in court?"

1739
01:58:08,366 --> 01:58:09,658
For fuck's sake,
will you catch yourself?

1740
01:58:09,742 --> 01:58:11,576
They've kept us
in prison for 15 years.

1741
01:58:11,661 --> 01:58:12,994
They can keep us in for another 15.

1742
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:14,871
This is the fuckin'
government, Gareth!

1743
01:58:15,373 --> 01:58:17,958
It's the fuckin' government!
What are they gonna say?

1744
01:58:18,626 --> 01:58:20,627
"We're sorry about that?"

1745
01:58:21,545 --> 01:58:24,506
"Made a wee bit of a mistake there,
but you can be on your way now?"

1746
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:26,716
What are they gonna say?
"Sorry we killed your da"?

1747
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:28,510
"Sorry we fucked
your fucking life to hell"?

1748
01:58:28,594 --> 01:58:30,762
What are they going to say?

1749
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:36,101
Gerry...

1750
01:58:47,405 --> 01:58:49,990
Look, I'm not putting my
mother through hell again.

1751
01:58:51,242 --> 01:58:52,575
Are you afraid of court?

1752
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,161
Look, I just don't wanna be
humiliated again.

1753
01:59:16,767 --> 01:59:18,059
I swear by Almighty God

1754
01:59:18,144 --> 01:59:21,521
that the evidence I shall give shall
be the truth, the whole truth

1755
01:59:21,605 --> 01:59:23,648
and nothing but the truth.

1756
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:34,451
Mr. Dixon, do you know
these young people

1757
01:59:35,828 --> 01:59:37,954
known as the Guildford Four?

1758
01:59:40,166 --> 01:59:41,332
Yes, I do.

1759
01:59:42,418 --> 01:59:44,461
Do you know how long
they have spent in jail?

1760
01:59:46,297 --> 01:59:48,298
Fifteen years, I believe.

1761
01:59:49,842 --> 01:59:51,509
Do you know Annie Maguire

1762
01:59:52,595 --> 01:59:55,430
who served her 14 years
without remission?

1763
01:59:56,807 --> 01:59:59,476
Do you know her son Vincent
who served five years?

1764
01:59:59,852 --> 02:00:01,394
Do you know her son Patrick
who served four?

1765
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:03,646
Do you know her husband,
Paddy Maguire,

1766
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:05,982
who served 12 years?

1767
02:00:06,859 --> 02:00:10,487
Carole Richardson was 17 when
she went to jail, Mr. Dixon.

1768
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,280
Now she is 32.

1769
02:00:14,533 --> 02:00:15,909
Do you know Carole Richardson?

1770
02:00:15,993 --> 02:00:17,786
My Lord, what is the point of this?

1771
02:00:17,953 --> 02:00:20,371
Yes, come to the point,
Mrs. Peirce.

1772
02:00:27,421 --> 02:00:29,923
Do you know who this is,
Mr. Dixon?

1773
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:35,887
No, I don't.

1774
02:00:36,847 --> 02:00:39,182
Well, then would you be so kind

1775
02:00:39,266 --> 02:00:41,601
as to read this statement
that you took from him

1776
02:00:41,685 --> 02:00:44,729
on the 3rd of November, 1974?

1777
02:00:44,814 --> 02:00:47,941
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all of these people,

1778
02:00:48,025 --> 02:00:49,150
all these innocent people.

1779
02:00:49,235 --> 02:00:50,944
My Lord, I need to see a
copy of this statement.

1780
02:00:51,028 --> 02:00:55,031
Either that man or his superior
or his superior's superior

1781
02:00:55,116 --> 02:00:57,534
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats

1782
02:00:57,618 --> 02:00:59,577
by a nation that was baying for blood...
Mrs. Peirce!

1783
02:00:59,662 --> 02:01:00,662
My Lord!

1784
02:01:00,746 --> 02:01:04,249
In return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1785
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:05,625
And by God, you've got
your blood, Mr. Dixon.

1786
02:01:05,709 --> 02:01:07,252
Mrs. Peirce is making
a political speech.

1787
02:01:07,378 --> 02:01:09,045
This is outrageous.
You got the blood of Guiseppe Conlon,

1788
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:11,047
you got the lifeblood
of Carole Richardson,

1789
02:01:11,132 --> 02:01:14,092
and you got 15 years of blood and
sweat and pain from my client

1790
02:01:14,176 --> 02:01:17,178
whose only crime was that he was Irish.
-Silence in court!

1791
02:01:17,263 --> 02:01:20,140
And he was foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

1792
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:23,476
Mrs. Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

1793
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,526
And one of your colleagues, My Lord,

1794
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:33,736
who sat where you sit
now said, and I quote,

1795
02:01:33,821 --> 02:01:36,906
"It is a pity you were not charged
with treason to the Crown,

1796
02:01:36,991 --> 02:01:40,577
"a charge that carries a
penalty of death by hanging.

1797
02:01:40,786 --> 02:01:44,247
"A sentence I would have no
difficulty in passing in this case."

1798
02:01:44,582 --> 02:01:48,042
Mrs. Peirce, I am trying
to read this document.

1799
02:01:48,127 --> 02:01:50,712
I will not tell you again to be silent

1800
02:01:50,796 --> 02:01:54,132
or you will be removed from the court.

1801
02:02:36,258 --> 02:02:38,760
My Lord, this document

1802
02:02:38,844 --> 02:02:41,721
brings the entire British
legal system into disrepute.

1803
02:02:42,014 --> 02:02:44,432
My Lord, this is new evidence.

1804
02:02:44,808 --> 02:02:46,476
It is shocking new evidence.

1805
02:02:46,977 --> 02:02:48,186
My Lord, this evidence

1806
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:51,481
was not submitted at the
trial that is under appeal.

1807
02:02:51,732 --> 02:02:55,151
That, I believe, is the point that Mrs.
Peirce is trying to make.

1808
02:02:55,361 --> 02:02:56,527
Proceed, Mrs. Peirce.

1809
02:02:56,612 --> 02:02:57,695
My Lord, I demand a recess.

1810
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,990
There will be no demands
made in my court.

1811
02:03:02,201 --> 02:03:03,576
Stand back.

1812
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:09,999
My Lord, this alibi for Gerry Conlon

1813
02:03:11,085 --> 02:03:12,543
was taken by Mr. Dixon

1814
02:03:12,628 --> 02:03:15,421
one month after
Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1815
02:03:16,257 --> 02:03:20,051
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

1816
02:03:20,344 --> 02:03:22,178
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defense."

1817
02:03:29,937 --> 02:03:32,605
I have one question
to ask you, Mr. Dixon.

1818
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:34,983
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon,

1819
02:03:35,067 --> 02:03:38,695
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people,

1820
02:03:39,655 --> 02:03:41,322
kept from the defense?

1821
02:03:49,373 --> 02:03:51,124
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

1822
02:03:51,959 --> 02:03:53,710
Silence!

1823
02:03:53,961 --> 02:03:54,961
It's about time!

1824
02:03:55,045 --> 02:03:56,754
Order in the court!

1825
02:03:58,716 --> 02:04:01,551
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

1826
02:04:01,635 --> 02:04:02,885
This is most irregular.

1827
02:04:03,053 --> 02:04:05,471
Yes. I am aware of that,
My Lord.

1828
02:04:06,557 --> 02:04:07,890
Very well.

1829
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:26,451
Mr. Dixon,
you may stand down.

1830
02:04:26,535 --> 02:04:28,161
No! No! No!
My Lord!

1831
02:04:28,245 --> 02:04:30,455
My Lord, this is the man
who should be under arrest!

1832
02:04:30,581 --> 02:04:32,749
Be silent,
Mrs. Peirce!

1833
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:34,625
This court is now in recess.

1834
02:04:34,710 --> 02:04:35,960
Guards, get ready.

1835
02:04:36,253 --> 02:04:38,379
Look, don't try
and make me the fall guy

1836
02:04:38,464 --> 02:04:41,132
for the whole
British legal establishment.

1837
02:04:45,554 --> 02:04:48,222
Look, if I accept this mercy deal...

1838
02:04:48,724 --> 02:04:49,974
They've a flippin' cheek,
offering me mercy.

1839
02:04:50,059 --> 02:04:51,601
I mean, they should be begging
for mercy themselves.

1840
02:04:52,603 --> 02:04:53,728
You ready, Mr. Conlon?
Aye.

1841
02:04:53,812 --> 02:04:55,188
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

1842
02:04:55,272 --> 02:04:56,481
I know.
The truth has to come out.

1843
02:04:56,565 --> 02:04:57,690
They may not want to hear it
in the court,

1844
02:04:57,775 --> 02:04:59,525
but there's people outside
who'll listen.

1845
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:00,860
Just think about it, will you?

1846
02:05:00,944 --> 02:05:02,028
Just think about it.

1847
02:05:02,112 --> 02:05:03,154
All right.

1848
02:05:03,238 --> 02:05:04,781
Aye. Give us three of them.

1849
02:05:20,589 --> 02:05:21,839
Silence!

1850
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:30,139
In the matter of Her Majesty vs.
Gerard Patrick Conlon,

1851
02:05:31,058 --> 02:05:33,518
the case is hereby dismissed.

1852
02:05:38,065 --> 02:05:40,400
My husband died in your
prison an innocent man!

1853
02:05:40,484 --> 02:05:42,860
I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.

1854
02:05:42,945 --> 02:05:44,070
I'll see you outside.

1855
02:05:44,154 --> 02:05:45,822
This way. Let's go.
I'm going out the front door.

1856
02:05:46,198 --> 02:05:47,365
What about Guiseppe Conlon?

1857
02:05:47,574 --> 02:05:49,909
Your Honor, he was an innocent man!

1858
02:05:52,704 --> 02:05:54,914
Mr. Conlon, that's not a good idea.
Use the back...

1859
02:05:54,998 --> 02:05:56,249
For security reasons.

1860
02:05:56,333 --> 02:05:57,959
I'm a free man, and I'm
going out the front door.

1861
02:05:58,669 --> 02:05:59,710
Get back.

1862
02:05:59,795 --> 02:06:03,673
In the matter of
Her Majesty vs. Paul Hill,

1863
02:06:03,757 --> 02:06:06,551
the case is hereby dismissed.

1864
02:06:13,934 --> 02:06:17,478
Leave me alone!
I'm going out the front door with Gerry!

1865
02:06:20,607 --> 02:06:25,027
In the matter of Her Majesty vs.
Patrick Armstrong,

1866
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:27,947
the case is hereby dismissed.

1867
02:06:29,992 --> 02:06:33,995
In the matter of Her Majesty vs.
Carole Richardson,

1868
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:36,998
the case is hereby dismissed.

1869
02:06:37,916 --> 02:06:39,375
I'm an innocent man!

1870
02:06:39,501 --> 02:06:43,629
I spent 15 years in prison
for something I didn't do!

1871
02:06:43,714 --> 02:06:45,548
I watched my father die

1872
02:06:45,632 --> 02:06:48,217
in a British prison
for something he didn't do!

1873
02:06:48,385 --> 02:06:51,220
And this government
still says he's guilty!

1874
02:06:51,305 --> 02:06:53,181
I want to tell them

1875
02:06:53,265 --> 02:06:56,309
that until my father
is proved innocent,

1876
02:06:56,393 --> 02:06:59,979
until all the people involved in
this case are proved innocent,

1877
02:07:00,063 --> 02:07:02,648
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice,

1878
02:07:03,108 --> 02:07:04,775
I will fight on

1879
02:07:05,194 --> 02:07:07,779
in the name of my father

1880
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,779
and of the truth.
