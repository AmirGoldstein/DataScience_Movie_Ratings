00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,282
EDDIE <i>CHUNG: After a long day
at work in the spring of 2004,</i>

2
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,191
<i>I met up with a
friend at the bar.</i>

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,221
<i>Pissed, tired and just uptight,
I was in need for a beer.</i>

4
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,829
<i>Three in, I discovered he and a couple
of buddies were heading to Las Vegas</i>

5
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,931
<i>for</i> a <i>far-out convention
called the Lebowski Festival.</i>

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,912
<i>I had seen </i>The Big Lebowski<i>
when it first came out,</i>

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,280
<i>but like many, I did not
get the grandeur of the movie.</i>

8
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,583
<i>Curious, I packed up my camera
gear and set off to Lost Wages,</i>

9
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,147
<i>expecting nothing,
but hoping for everything.</i>

10
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,252
Take it easy with the camera, man.
Just take it easy, man.

11
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,630
You name me one movie that has
so many touches of life in it.

12
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,560
Nothing is lost in this movie.

13
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,604
You know, we're the only
four people in the world

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,266
who really have a big
following for this movie.

15
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,708
A guy went overseas...
I know the story.

16
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,440
And the guy, he was sitting
in a bar in the UK,

17
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,049
and he was kind of venting to
the bartender, as people do.

18
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:16,020
And he turned to the bartender, and
he goes, "Friends like these men."

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,888
And then the bartender kind of looked
up, and his eyes kind of sprouted,

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,223
and they're like,
"Friends like these."

21
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,456
And they began to quote
Lebowski quotes all night.

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,433
<i>CHUNG: Now, the story unfolded when
Will Russell and Scott Shuffitt</i>

23
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,202
<i>decided to riff fines from
the movie The</i> Big <i>Lebowski</i>

24
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,107
<i>and noticed people
were riffing back.</i>

25
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,045
So <i>goes the idea of</i> a <i>fest.</i>

26
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,217
<i>In the most unlikely of places,</i>
a <i>Baptist-run bowling alley,</i>

27
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,812
<i>Will and Scott opened the doors
to the very first Lebowski Fest.</i>

28
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,887
My name is Scott Shuffitt,
I am co-producer

29
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,952
of the first annual Big
Lebowski What Have You Fest

30
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,261
being held in the Fellowship
Lanes, Louisville, Kentucky.

31
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,767
<i>Will Russell,
official Louisvillian.</i>

32
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:08,773
Scott and I, about three months
ago, we were vending a convention

33
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,331
<i>for the Mothership Connection.</i>

34
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,308
<i>They knew those Lebowski lines,</i>

35
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,405
and we began to realize that
there was a community out there,

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,352
a very, very 'large community of people
with feeling towards a fantastic movie

37
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,548
that was created
by the Coen Brothers.

38
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,887
<i>Someone said we should have</i>
a Big <i>Lebowski convention.</i>

39
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,153
It happened.

40
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,458
And then it was just
like... I was, like...

41
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,096
<i>The next thing you know,
we were taking notes.</i>

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,691
The bowling alley that we
picked was the Fellowship Lanes,

43
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,032
<i>which was</i> a <i>Baptist-run
bowling alley.</i>

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>They had</i> a <i>big sigh at the door
when we walked in that said,</i>

45
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,064
<i>"No Cussing.</i> “

46
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,608
They also allowed no drinking,

47
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,908
but they smoked lots of cigarettes,
and they sold all the hot dogs,

48
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,311
<i>so those Baptists
were very happy.</i>

49
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,545
Fellowship Lanes. We should have a
dress-as-your-favorite-character contest.

50
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,416
<i>Highest bowling score.
Highest bowling score.</i>

51
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,617
<i>It really</i> just... <i>It wrote itself.
We put up</i> a <i>website,</i>

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,626
<i>and it was just unbelievable
the response we got.</i>

53
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,683
<i>Fantastic.</i>

54
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,162
Yesterday, we had, like, 160
unique visitors to the site.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,063
<i>Everybody is just
in love with this idea.</i>

56
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,600
The media.

57
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,794
<i>The bowling guy.</i>

58
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,964
So, I'm Mike Walsh. I am driving around
the country, bowling in all 50 states,

59
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,031
and I came here, kind of out of my way.
I was scheduled to be bowling

60
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,805
with some funeral directors
in South Jersey tonight,

61
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,006
but I heard about the
party through my website.

62
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,141
Someone e-mailed me about
this one, so I checked out

63
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,015
the Big Lebowski website,
and I couldn't miss it.

64
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,316
Anyone who's bothering
to throw a party

65
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,755
on the shady side of
Louisville has got my vote.

66
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,589
<i>I understand this is the First
Annual, and with a lot of things,</i>

67
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,028
<i>they never happen again the second time,
but I can feel there is a vibe here,</i>

68
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,264
and you know that this thing
is going to last for 50 years,

69
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,063
and I'll be damned
if I miss one.

70
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,837
<i>CHUNG: So it began.</i>

71
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,631
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

72
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,801
<i>Two guys from Louisville, Kentucky,
planted the seed for</i> a <i>social phenomenon.</i>

73
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:56,505
<i>The concept is simple. Gather fans, bowl,
drink like Russians, and just be Dude.</i>

74
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,173
<i>You see what happens?
This is what happens.</i>

75
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:03,048
<i>And, eventually, the media caught
on to spread the Lebowski lexicon.</i>

76
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,421
We were driving to her
parents' house when I found out

77
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,393
that we were in Spin magazine, which
was probably the biggest moment

78
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,520
in Lebowski Fest history so far.

79
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,596
We were mentioned as one of
the 19 events you can't miss

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,659
with, like, Lollapalooza, and Bonnaroo,
and fucking Warped Tour and Ozzfest.

81
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,759
It was unbelievable.

82
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,567
This is what The Big Lebowski does,
is it brings people together

83
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,301
<i>from the far
corners of the world.</i>

84
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,539
<i>Even if those corners are just North Carolina
and Kentucky, it brings them together</i>

85
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,480
in the spirit of goodwill
and friendship.

86
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,214
An Achiever is the
self-applied title

87
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,312
<i>of someone who</i> is a <i>fan
of The Big Lebowski.</i>

88
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,382
It doesn't matter what you're
into as far as your job,

89
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,768
<i>or what kind of music
you're into.</i>

90
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,853
You could walk up to
pretty much any Achiever

91
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,591
and just start up
a conversation.

92
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,156
They are a very diverse
group of folks.

93
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,602
I mean, you'll have from a
layabout to judges, professionals.

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,435
CHUNG: What do you guys
do for a living?

95
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,171
I'm actually a district attorney, but
I don't want to say where 'cause...

96
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,806
And I have a white-collar
job in Atlanta as well.

97
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,650
I work in advertising.
I'm a whore.

98
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,309
(ALL LAUGH)

99
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,720
Well, to me, Achiever has kind
of taken on a new air about it

100
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,157
since I've started my first
real job this past fall,

101
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,161
and I have the forum to
get me through the day,

102
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,255
and these people are really funny.
They're great folks.

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,765
I can't wait to go to Louisville.
I haven't been to Louisville yet,

104
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,325
and I'm looking
forward to going.

105
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,402
<i>CHUNG: In the summer of that same year, I
went to Louisville for the first time.</i>

106
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,843
<i>Dios mio, man.</i>

107
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,508
<i>What I found there was every bit as
stupefying as 5 had ever seen before.</i>

108
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,382
<i>What started as a one-day event
took on a carnival atmosphere.</i>

109
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,890
<i>Over 4,000 people attended,
not exactly</i> a <i>lightweight.</i>

110
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,595
<i>Some of the local Achievers
took me across the river to</i>

111

<i>their private residence
in Indiana</i>

112
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>and their friendliness
was overwhelming.</i>

113
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,696
My name's Andy Cheney.

114
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,937
I post to the forum with all the
other fellow Achievers here.

115
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,970
At my house in Indiana, it's the cookout,
the forum cookout, before the movie.

116
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,915
And there's plenty of burgers,
there's plenty of beer,

117
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,218
and thanks to our other fellow Achievers,
there's plenty of White Russians to have.

118
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,555
It's a good time, and
there's dogs to play with.

119
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,655
The best way I've always been
able to put Lebowski Fest

120
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:29,497
is imagine the best party you've
ever gone to, and then double it,

121
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,500
and I think last night is
a perfect example of that,

122
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,563
just a group of people
getting together,

123
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,009
<i>things getting pretty, what could
be considered out of hand,</i>

124
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,577
<i>but it's still just,
like,</i> a <i>good time.</i>

125
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,478
<i>Everyone's really friendly
with each other.</i>

126
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,177
Our troubles are fucking over, and
then we're going to the movie.

127
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,718
It's a way of life.

128
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,886
<i>CHUNG: A year later, the
festival came to my hometown,</i>

129
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,890
<i>Los Angeles, the City of Angels.</i>

130
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,291
<i>Jeff “the Dude" Dowd, who was the
inspiration for the character, the Dude,</i>

131
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,887
<i>made an appearance, along with some
of the other actors from the movie.</i>

132
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>If you ask me, this whole thing
is about friendship, new friends</i>

133
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,498
<i>and forever-going-on
friendship.</i>

134
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,041
My name's Jerry Haleva.
I'm in the dream sequence,

135
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,410
and so I'm trying to convey Saddam as
if he's working at this bowling alley.

136
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,906
They said, "How about coming to the
Lebowski Fest down in Los Angeles?"

137
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,316
And I said, "Great!"

138
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,548
I had not been familiar
with the Lebowski Fest,

139
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,923
and then I was invited to come down to
the one in Lakewood a year or so ago.

140
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm sort of driving along,
and I see all these people.

141
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,260
I've described it to people as,
clearly, the only place I've ever gone

142
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,929
where I felt like a rock star.

143
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:45,705
And it dawned on me, 'cause I could see these
guys with bathrobes on and flip-flops.

144
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,537
And it wasn't about, again, that
I play Saddam in the movies,

145
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,513
it was that I was Saddam
in The <i>Big</i> Lebowski.

146
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,077
So, I thought, "They're going to jump
on my car, they're going to swamp me."

147
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,750
That group of people,
everybody knew who I was.

148
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,657
Well, everybody was just the
opposite of what I thought.

149
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,356
My friend, he lives in
Portland, and he was like,

150
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,954
"I tell people I'm
from Kentucky,

151
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,330
“and they're, like, 'That's
where Lebowski Fest is from."'

152
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,370
And I'm like, "Fucking A. That
is what I'm talking about,

153
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,770
“putting Louisville on the map
as the home of Lebowski Fest

154
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,641
"instead of some backwoods
kind of hick thing, you know."

155
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,748
We're ready to throw some
rocks, knock some pins.

156
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:28,110
Maybe harass a few 8-year-olds.
Let's see what happens.

157
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,756
MAN 1: Saddam!
Let's see what happens.

158
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,153
MAN 1: Saddam!

159
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,816
MAN 2: Bring the Seattle
Seven, too.

160
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,985
Hey, Seattle Seven, come over.

161
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,255
Tim!

162
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,588
There he is.
We found our party.

163
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,565
MAN 3: This is our spot, man.

164
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,532
Apparently, I am standing in the
line you can see behind me,

165
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,136
waiting to get into the Lebowski
Fest bowling extravaganza.

166
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,043
The line is currently very long,

167
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,880
indicating that it is obviously the
most popular part of the festival.

168
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:04,445
I'm apparently dressed as Saddam Hussein,
which has a very small part in the movie

169
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,186
and hands out the bowling shoes
during a dream sequence to the Dude.

170
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,058
Now, the mustache I am wearing
is made of real human hair,

171
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,098
which I did not realize until
after I had purchased it.

172
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,328
It's also made in Korea,
so yeah.

173
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,098
I just don't want to think of
where this hair has come from.

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,664
And it's applied with spirit gum, so
I really shouldn't smoke anything

175
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,437
'cause I will burn.

176
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,138
<i>CHUNG: When released in</i> 1998, <i>The</i> Big
<i>Lebowski did not fill many seats,</i>

177
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,443
<i>but that was then.</i>

178
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,418
<i>Years later, the movie found its
audience and became a cult sensation,</i>

179
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,477
<i>to use the parlance of our time.</i>

180
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,359
<i>To my amazement, the costumes begin
to take on</i> a <i>cerebral element,</i>

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,258
<i>delving into the minds of
the characters from the movie.</i>

182
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,731
Last year, I went as the walrus,
and that is from the scene

183
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:54,033
where Donny mistakenly takes the quote
by Lenin as being by John Lennon,

184
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,768
so he keeps saying, "I am the walrus.
I am the walrus."

185
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,300
So I came as a walrus. It's getting
hard to find a good costume.

186
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,382
Everything's been done, so you got to
really try hard to find a good costume.

187
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,975
Why did you dress
up like Sandy Koufax?

188
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,885
'Cause Walter says in the movie,
"Damned right he's Jewish.

189
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,391
"3,000 years of beautiful tradition
from Moses to Sandy Koufax."

190
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,519
So we had to be the span
of Moses to Sandy Koufax.

191
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,499
And Brian's also one of his buddies
who died facedown in the mud,

192
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,831
so we represent
Walter's subconscious.

193
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,803
Well, I was inspired by
the Lebowski Fest West.

194
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,432
I saw a girl dressed
up as the toe,

195
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,905
and I thought, "Well, if you can be the
toe, you can be anything in the movie."

196
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,039
<i>Who's in the movie
more than Jeff?</i>

197
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,377
<i>The Caucasian.</i>

198
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,214
So here we are. You can't have a
Lebowski Fest without the Caucasian.

199
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,086
<i>Eddie! Eddie!
ALL: (CHANTING) Eddie! Eddie!</i>

200
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,647
<i>CHUNG: After years of filming,
I discovered the Achievers</i>

201
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,249
<i>embraced me as one of their own.</i>

202
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,785
<i>Without even realizing it, I had a
character to play in this whole scene,</i>

203
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,127
<i>the Chinaman with the camera.</i>

204
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,428
Excuse me, camera-American.

205
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,960
There's only one documentarian, and
that documentarian's name is Eddie.

206
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,372
So many bullshit
documentaries going on.

207
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,401
Johnny-come-lately
wannabe motherfuckers.

208
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,139
They don't got the
fucking street credit

209
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,912
of the one and only real
Lebowski Fest documentary.

210
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,150
Did you guys ever hear
of the Seattle Seven?

211
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,021
That's the Dude, and six other guys.
We traveled all the way from Seattle.

212
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,821
Seattle Seven right there.

213
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,222
It started out as a
fucking Vietnam protest,

214
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,890
but then it just turned into
a fucking bowling team now.

215
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,159
It's bigger.
It's bigger.

216
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:32,397
It's bigger. We just drink old sodas and
White Russians and just get her done.

217
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,208
<i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

218
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,013
<i>CHUNG: The fest went to the city
where the other Jeffrey Lebowski,</i>

219
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,281
<i>the real Dude,
protested the man,</i>

220
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,449
<i>marking his place in the
American cultural revolution.</i>

221
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,618
When I was first asked to
go to what was the second

222
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,389
Lebowski Festival in Louisville,

223
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,329
<i>I was very surprised, I mean,
really surprised, by what I saw.</i>

224
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,298
<i>What you saw there,
which was really great,</i>

225
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,302
<i>was all these people gathering
together and making new friends.</i>

226
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:11,206
<i>But I met couples and people who were
secretaries and doctors and students</i>

227
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,775
<i>and, you know, all kinds
of different people.</i>

228
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,403
The film got to them.

229
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,821
<i>CHUNG: I realize now that the Fest is more
than just a celebration of the movie.</i>

230
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,162
<i>It breaks down barriers and
builds lifelong friendships.</i>

231
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,294
<i>Andy's wife said it best.
It is</i> a <i>way of life.</i>

232
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,032
<i>One more festival ends.</i>

233
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:46,237
<i>The last I will photograph, but definitely
not the last one to come as an Achiever.</i>

234
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,185
These fuckers behind the camera,
they're married, they have kids,

235
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,883
and they're trying to get
some kind of shit on us.

236
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,546
All right? This is
some wholesome stuff.

237
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,960
Hey, hey, Travis.
Huh? How about your real name, Travis?

238
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,162
Travis. How do you like that?

239
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,824
It's on camera, isn't it?
We know it is.

240
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,094
Travis. Yeah. You're
gonna edit that out?

241
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,367
Some things that
we call "secrets"...

242
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,735
What are you laughing
about, Ronnie,

243
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,069
the sound guy?
Really aren't "secrets."

244
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,597
Yeah? You should see these two,
what they did last night. Huh?

245
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,665
It was dangerous.

246
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,838
I mean, porn stars
wouldn't go that low.

247
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,903
Dangerous.

248
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,450
How about that?
The truth is out now.

249
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,746
You got the camera
all pointed on us.

250
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,578
Look at these guys.

251
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,522
Just a note, here. Just a note,
this guy's totally unprepared.

252
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,528
He has no list of questions.

253
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,532
I mean, he's a total slacker,
alienated, Lebowski guy.

254
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,467
Just a note, here. This is
who comes to interview me.

255
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,902
All right?
Nothing. Nothing.
