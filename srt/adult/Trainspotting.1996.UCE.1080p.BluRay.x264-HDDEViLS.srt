the fuck out of there, and after that,

It was one of his major weaknesses.

and he never cheated on anyone.

he can hardly hold the fucking cue,

so all he has to do is to pot the black

to salvage a little bit of pride

Being perpetrated with three of the most
useless and unreliable fuckups in town.

1021
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,921
I knew what was going on in his mind.

1022
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,716
Any trouble in London,
and he would dump us immediately.

1023
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,176
One way or another, he had to.

1024
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,137
If he got caught
with a bag full of skag

1025
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:45,516
on top of that armed robbery shit,
he was going down for 1 5 to 20.

1026
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,976
Begbie was hard.

1027
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,855
But not so hard that he didn't
shite it off 20 years in prison.

1028
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,822
This was to be my final hit.

1029
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,201
But let's be clear about this.
There are final hits and final hits.

1030
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:07,538
What kind was this to be?

1031
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,046
-Did you bring the cards?
-What?

1032
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:18,507
The cards, the last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1033
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,384
I've not brought them.

1034
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,056
It's fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

1035
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,390
I'm sorry.

1036
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,810
-Bit fucking late.
-Why didn't you bring them?

1037
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,397
'Cause I fucking told you to bring them,
you doss cunt.

1038
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,274
Christ.

1039
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,657
MAN: These are your friends, right?

1040
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,283
SICK BOY: These are the guys
I told you about.

1041
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,910
MAN: Okay.

1042
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,204
-Well, is he here?
-Yeah, he's here.

1043
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:33,999
-You didn't get followed, did you?
-We didn't get followed.

1044
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,626
Okay.

1045
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,937
-All right.
-Hi.

1046
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,526
RENTON: Straightaway
he clocked us for what we were.

1047
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,446
Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.

1048
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:15,916
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1051
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,763
So...

1052
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,724
How much would you like for this?

1053
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,145
£20,000.

1054
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,730
(CHUCKLING)

1055
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:23,234
I don't think it's worth
much more than £1 5,000.

1056
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,904
RENTON: This was a real drag to him.
He didn't need to negotiate.

1057
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,406
What the fuck were we going to do
with it if he didn't buy it?

1058
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,159
Sell it on the streets? Fuck that.

1059
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:36,288
-Well, £1 9,000.
-Terribly sorry, I can't go to £1 9,000.

1060
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,252
Well, fucking £1 6,000 then.

1061
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,670
(CHUCKLING)

1062
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,007
Okay. Well, fucking £1 6,000 it is, then.

1063
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,182
These, gentlemen, are £2,000 bundles.

1064
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,600
That's two.

1065
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:00,271
That's four.

1066
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:02,606
RENTON: We settled on £1 6,000.

1067
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:06,861
He had a lot more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.

1068
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,320
DEALER: ...make eight.

1069
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:16,036
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1070
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,789
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
haggling with you.

1071
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,749
Fucking brand-new, by the way.

1072
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:24,587
Okay?

1073
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,382

(ALL LAUGHING)

1075
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:34,263
RENTON: Just for a moment,
it felt really great.

1076
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,808
Like we were all in it together,
like friends, like it meant something.

1077
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,394
A moment like that,
it can touch you deep inside.

1078
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:43,522
That doesn't last long.
Not like £1 6,000.

1079
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:46,817
What about you, Spud?
Any major investments on the horizon?

1080
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,694
Going to buy yourself
an island in the sun?

1081
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,279
For fucking £4,000?

1082
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,823
One palm tree, a couple of rocks
and a fucking sewage outflow.

1083

(ALL LAUGHING)

1084
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:57,661
I don't know, man.

1085
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:00,497
I'm going to get something for my ma.

1086
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,667
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1087
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:06,670
Then get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1088
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:10,674
-And shag her senseless?
-No, man, true love. True love.

1089
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:15,679
But I could really handle some hot sex
with a Jewish princess tonight.

1090
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,848
-You daft cunt.
-Or a Catholic.

1091
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,352
If you're going to waste it on a bird,
you might as well leave it all to me.

1092
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,729
-Now get the drinks in.
-I got a round already.

1093
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:26,482
-I got the last one.
-It's your round, Franco.

1094
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,736
Okay. Same again? Right.

1095
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,655
SICK BOY: I'm off for a piss.

1096
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,157
See when I get back
that money's still here.

1097
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,201
The moment your back's turned
we're out the door.

1098
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,869
I'll be right fucking after you.

1099
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,664
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1100
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,874
By the way, see, when I get back...

1101
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,752
We'll be halfway down the street
with the money.

1102
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:50,089
-I'd fucking kill you.
-I thought you might, Franco.

Thought you might.

Are you game for it?

1105
01:22:58,848 --> 01:22:59,974

01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,394

01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,699
I don't know. What do you think?

1109
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,787
-Still here, I see.
-We wouldn't run out on a mate.

to the hospital, man.

You're not going to any fucking
hospital. You're staying there.

to myself in all sorts of ways.

01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:36,560
It wasn't a big deal,
just a minor betrayal.

1138
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:40,188
Or we'd outgrown each other,
you know, that sort of thing.

1139

But let's face it, I ripped them off,
my so-called mates.

1140

But, Begbie,
I couldn't give a shit about him.

1141
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:51,908
Sick Boy would have done the same to me
if he'd only thought of it first.

He never hurt anybody.

I could offer a million answers,
all false.

1151
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,414
The truth is that I'm a bad person.

But that is going to change.
I'm going to change.
