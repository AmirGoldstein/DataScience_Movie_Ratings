1
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,814
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,696
...I always think of her head.

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,950
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,244
unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,038
trying to get answers.

6
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,626
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,003
"What are you thinking?"

8
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,297
"How are you feeling?"

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,092
"What have we done to each other?"

10
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,066
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,862
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,365
I got you a present.

13
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,351
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

14
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,619
You loved it.

15
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,080
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,041
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,383
What's up, Jitters?

18
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,305
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,725
with another excruciating story
by Margo Dunne.

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,436
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,480
- changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

22
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,400
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,368
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,445
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,625
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,449
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,451
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,453
- 5 years.
- 5?

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,663
That came fast.

30
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,164
And furious.

31
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,797
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,968
I met a boy.

33
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,556
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

34
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,976
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,477
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,314
where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,066
because the party's down to three
Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.

38
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,914
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,821
It could.
I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.

40
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,328
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,247
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,415
"Meat"?

43
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,666
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

44
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,544
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,004
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,340
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,716
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,345
while he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about Proust.

49
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,680
Uh-oh. ls that him?

50
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,129
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,353
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."

52
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,397
What type are you?

53
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,899
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,067
Missouri?

55
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,026
Cute.

56
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,403
- Native New Yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,571
What's your name?

58
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,697
Amy.

59
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,033
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,412
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,625
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,920
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,383
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,678
and I happen to be a charter subscriber
to Middling Warlord Weekly...

65
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,054
so I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,597
I'm gonna go with "C."

67
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,182
And you?

68
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,434
Who are you?

69
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,939
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,737
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,032
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,283
No.

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,397
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,246
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,872
Never with you.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,748
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,417
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,252
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,086
Why?

80
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,754
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,922
My chin?

82
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,633
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,427
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,597
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,974
Okay.

86
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,434
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,604
and we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,233
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,404
You have to see this.

90
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:12,955
Hey.

91
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,081
Hey.

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,675
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,135
Is that right?

94
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,472
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,475
Wait a second.

96
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,645
There you go.

97
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,992
Nick Dunne...

98
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,829
I really like you.

99
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,254
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,381
treasure hunts?

101
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,425
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,428
what an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,679
Wow.

104
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,101
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,353
Deep Hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,854
Spin.

107
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,774
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,111
"When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,862
"this dessert just must be sold."

110
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,030
The answer?

111
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,698
I still don't know the answer, Go.

112
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,909
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,677
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,123
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,040
What did you get her?

116
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,458
A kite.

117
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,460
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,880
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,300
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,635
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,719
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,054
What's the gift for 5?

123
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:52,888
Wood.

124
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,416
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,769
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,396
"There's some wood for you, bitch."

127
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,234
The Bar.

128
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,279
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,613
Hey, it's Watchful Wally.

130
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,909
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,373
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

132
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,263
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,974
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,033
Ame?

135
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,846
Amy!

136
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,526
Hello?

137
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,153
Come on in.

138
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,571
Hey.

139
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,031
- Mister Dunne.
- Hi.

140
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,575
I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
This is Officer James Gilpin.

141
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,663
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,665
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,502
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,921
but it's weird, right?

145
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,173
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,216
Please.

147
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,664
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,387
2 years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,554
City?

150
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,683
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,351
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,019
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,022
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,524
She's dead.

155
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,692
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,700
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
My sister Margo and I
own The Bar downtown.

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,579
Oh, The Bar.

159
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,873
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
Thanks.

161
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,879
Pretty things.

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,844
Stay.

163
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,762
My office, here.

164
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,851
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,522
Date night?

166
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,940
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,611
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,405
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,115
I checked up here.

170
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,495
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,955
obviously.

172
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,431
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,224
Amy's office.

174
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,282
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,487
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,785
I remember these.

177
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,287
I loved these books.

178
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,751
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,920
Your wife is Amazing Amy?

180
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,714
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,508
Wow.

182
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,014
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,849
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:12,064
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

185
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,735
Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,737
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,491
In the next book,
Amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,953
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,746
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,832
She made varsity.

191
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,127
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,294
She got the dog.

193
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,297
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
Wow.

195
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,843
I love your parents...

196
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,678
but they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,179
- Nick!
- Sir!

198
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,014
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:46,849
No problem.

200
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,434
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,310
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,189
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,108
bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,026
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,695
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

206
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,030
15 minutes, tops.

207
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,535
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,204
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,292
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,544
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,045
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,548
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

213
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,925
Hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,760
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,568
Amy, you know
what would make Dad's night.

216
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,222
I'm on it.

217
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,393
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,686
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,563
it's difficult for you to see
Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,900
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,277
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,112
Is that correct?

223
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,700
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,704
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,872
It's you.

226
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,583
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,086
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick Dunne for how long?

228
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,923
- 2 magical years.
- 2 magical years.

229
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,799
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,302
to perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,264
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

232
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,766
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,134
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,727
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,939
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,626
when Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,818
of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,904
These bag of bone shoes

239
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,113
That's just frightening.

240
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,493
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,454
Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,999
You are brilliant,
yet entirely UN-snobby.

244
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,670
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,171
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,298
you have a world-class vagina.

247
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,428
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,639
Is that correct?

249
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,140
I'm not.

250
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,642
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,645
And then...

252
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,648
the night wasn't so bad anymore.

253
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,375
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,379
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,987
but given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,008
and given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,510
we are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,678
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,848
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,496
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

261
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,810
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,578
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,565
- We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
- You're having a press conference?

264
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,191
I wanna get the word out, right?

265
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,654
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode.

266
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,748
Time is of the essence in these cases.

267
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,542
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

268
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

269
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,545
So, you and Amy
have been here 2 years.

270
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,840
- You tend bar...
- I own The Bar.

271
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,385
And I teach creative writing at MVCC.

272
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,220
- No kids?
- Not yet.

273
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,722
So, what does Amy do most days?

274
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,099
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

275
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,893
I don't know. She keeps busy.

276
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,561
Doing what?

277
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,273
She's a voracious reader.

278
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,276
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

279
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,695
Well, days can get long.

280
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,574
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

281
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,909
Or prescription pills.

282
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,517
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

283
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,954
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some OxyContin.

284
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,082
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

285
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,583
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

286
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,086
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

287
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

288
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,257
No, not really.

289
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,259
No friends? This whole town?

290
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,930
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

291
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,218
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

292
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,392
in our neighborhood.

293
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,486
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

294
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,771
We'll look into that.

295
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,315
You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.

296
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,942
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

297
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,110
Well, I was home.

298
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,612
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

299
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,380
I went to Sawyer Beach
and read the news.

300
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,491
Did you visit with anyone there?

301
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,618
I kind of go to Sawyer Beach
for the solitude.

302
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,247
So, your wife has no friends here.

303
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,124
Is she kinda stand of fish?

304
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,584
Ivy League? Rubs people the wrong way?

305
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,253
She's from New York.

306
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,632
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

307
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Type A?

308
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,428
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

309
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,305
You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.

310
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,641
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

311
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,852
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

312
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,688
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

313
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,648
and you don't know
your wife's blood type.

314
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,941
Sure you all are married?

315
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,694
Maybe it's type O.

316
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,779
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,531
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

318
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,699
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

319
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,493
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

320
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,954
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

321
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,457
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

322
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,833
Fine.

323
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,257
Should I know my wife's blood type?

324
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,341
No.

325
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,345
I apologize, Marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

326
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,889
Now I'm at the station...

327
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,559
and the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

328
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,104
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

329
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm standing right next to
Detective Rhonda Boney...

330
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,526
who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

331
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,947
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

332
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,533
This is Detective Boney.

333
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,910
I wanna go home.

334
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,412
I don't know why I have to be here.

335
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,081
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

336
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,374
Dad?

337
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,251
This is my father. What's going on?

338
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,461
Really? You're Nick Dunne?

339
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,588
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

340
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,396
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

341
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,466
- Bitch.
- Don't.

342
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,885
Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill
after lunch.

343
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,304
We found him walking Route 79,
disoriented.

344
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,806
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,098
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

346
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

347
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

348
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,229
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

349
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,939
Dad, stop.

350
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,818
You wanna drive him home?

351
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,779
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

352
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,426
This voice mailbox is currently full.

353
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,345
Fuck.

354
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,933
Get your fucking hands off me.

355
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,476
Thanks.

356
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,326
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

357
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,954
marriage is hard work.

358
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,040
And compromise and more work.

359
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,334
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."

360
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,296
"When young Amy's hope did wane...

361
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,672
"she wandered here..."

362
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,216
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

363
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,886
"...in search of Jane."

364
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,972
With us, 2 years...

365
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,640
it's just good.

366
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,976
Austen.

367
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,481
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

368
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,984
Look at that.

369
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,195
My God.

370
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,864
You naughty minx.

371
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,992
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

372
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

373
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,205
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

374
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,082
God bless Jane Austen.

375
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,435
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

376
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,690
Thank you.

377
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,193
Year two. Cotton.

378
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:29,079
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

379
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,706
So, these are 2,000 thread-count...

380
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,547
We're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

381
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,926
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

382
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,827
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

383
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,056
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

384
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,392
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

385
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,726
You know, they asked...

386
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,395
why didn't she have any friends?

387
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,270
What did you say?

388
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,439
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

389
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,068
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch."

390
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,158
God. I feel sick.

391
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,743
Thanks.

392
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,912
It's so bizarre.

393
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,456
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

394
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,666
She always attracts...

395
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,418
Drama?

396
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,503
You can say it. It's just me and you.

397
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,089
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

398
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,697
doesn't mean I don't care about her.

399
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,762
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

400
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,024
Detective? Excuse me.

401
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,818
I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

402
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,613
Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?

403
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,532
5 doors down. 1032.

404
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,784
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

405
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,703
Can I come by in half an hour?

406
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,455
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

407
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,291
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

408
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,792
But that's usually bath time.

409
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,129
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

410
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,123
All right. So, what do you got?

411
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,844
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

412
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,888
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

413
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,307
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

414
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,975
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

415
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,310
Well, okay.

416
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,022
Interesting.

417
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,148
What's that?

418
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,693
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

419
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,863
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

420
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,740
Even his bar's in her name.

421
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,700
I don't know that that's so surprising.

422
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,368
No. But it is humiliating.

423
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,328
What you got?

424
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,331
It's with her unmentionables.

425
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,554
Well, we have our first clue.

426
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,192
I have to take a shower.

427
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,027
No, don't. You've been up all night.

428
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,363
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

429
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,200
Hey, be careful today, okay?

430
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,576
That's a weird thing to say.

431
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,372
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

432
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,915
Please don't say, "Like Dad."

433
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,709
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

434
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,544
Perfect.

435
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,338
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

436
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,215
Okay. Just be...

437
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,175
Myself?

438
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,553
...sponsoring a raffle to
benefit West County 4H...

439
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,056
and raffling season tickets for
Mizzou football.

440
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,518
Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut or
local Tri-State Tire stores.

441
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,440
Your in-laws made it.

442
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,443
- Hi, Rand.
- Hey, man.

443
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,236
I'm Detective Boney.

444
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,238
I'm the twin. Margo.

445
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,366
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

446
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,742
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

447
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,670
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

448
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,745
We didn't have a lot of choice.

449
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,457
We are all worried. We are all scared.

450
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,087
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

451
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,099
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

452
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,267
Good.

453
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:25,106
As you know, my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...

454
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,067
disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

455
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,446
under suspicious circumstances.

456
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,947
Louder!

457
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:37,368
If anyone out there
has any information...

458
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,787
please come forward.

459
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,581
Thank you.

460
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,628
I'm Rand Elliott.
My wife, Marybeth Elliott.

461
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,879
Should I have said my name?

462
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,298
Amy is our only child.

463
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,469
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

464
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,471
She really is Amazing Amy.

465
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,390
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

466
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,976
who grew up with her and care about her.

467
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,771
We care about her, we love her.

468
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,066
And we just want her back.

469
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,487
Amy is a decorated scholar.

470
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,490
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

471
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,825
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

472
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,328
and she made a life in her adopted home.

473
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,665
Now, Amy needs your help.

474
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,835
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the Drury Lodge.

475
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:33,341
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.

476
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:39,013
And our website is
WWW.FindAmazingAmy.com.

477
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,474
- Mr. Dunne!
- Mr. Elliott!

478
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,686
Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?

479
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,108
Mr. Elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

480
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,610
Smile.

481
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,785
That's all for now. Thank you.

482
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,082
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

483
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,000
Right, Nick?

484
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,209
Yeah, definitely.

485
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,753
And we've had instances...

486
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,839
- where things got...
- Scary.

487
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,340
Do you know about Desi Collings?

488
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,050
Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.

489
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,343
He was obsessed.

490
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,722
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

491
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,307
We had to file a restraining order.

492
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,726
This would be high school?
20 years ago?

493
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,979
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just 2 hours away.

494
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,897
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

495
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,566
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

496
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,818
This is only 8 years ago,
in New York.

497
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,154
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

498
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,002
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

499
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,991
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

500
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,993
I only know it was bad.

501
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,828
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

502
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,788
Thank you.

503
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,248
Anything more recent?

504
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,587
Not that I know of.

505
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,967
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

506
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,762
Yeah.

507
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,393
Imagine our confusion.

508
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,603
A missing persons case...

509
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,230
and in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue."

510
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,524
That's for our anniversary.

511
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,860
My wife does these treasure hunts.

512
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

513
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,447
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

514
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,185
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

515
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,452
Of course. Okay.

516
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,205
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

517
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,666
"it's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

518
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,712
I know this one!

519
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,716
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

520
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,136
it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

521
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,933
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

522
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,019
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

523
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,275
Well, well. What does it say?

524
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,944
Clue two.

525
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,448
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

526
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,828
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

527
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,329
"Let's head on over...

528
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,164
"to the little brown house.

529
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,043
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."

530
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,089
These yours?

531
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,715
No.

532
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,092
But you read the first clue.

533
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,262
Randy professor, naughty student.

534
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,430
I blush.

535
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,265
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

536
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,755
Where's this little brown house?

537
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,394
I have no idea.

538
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,980
Hello?

539
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,524
Nicholas Dunne.

540
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,278
Under my father's name, William Dunne.

541
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,663
My wife's first pet? ls this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

542
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,831
Yeah, I know.

543
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,458
It's... It's...

544
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,213
It's "Puddles," right?
Or is it "Poodles?"

545
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,760
We're good.

546
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,346
Hello, stranger.

547
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,515
Fancy meeting you here.

548
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,850
It's your dad's house, right?

549
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,519
Are you following me?

550
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,436
What you doing?

551
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,647
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

552
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,525
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

553
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,611
But it looks okay.

554
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,239
I'll walk you out.

555
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,868
You know...

556
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,163
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

557
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,414
From the clue.

558
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,542
Nope. Still blue.

559
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,104
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

560
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,983
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

561
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,611
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

562
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,657
"So open the door, and look alive."

563
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,993
Bitch!

564
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,708
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

565
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,835
Add one recession...

566
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,461
subtract two jobs.

567
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,047
It's surprisingly effective.

568
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,508
Promise me we'll never be like them.

569
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,676
Like who?

570
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,469
All those awful couples we know.

571
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,473
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

572
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,100
to be trained and paraded.

573
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,437
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

574
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,398
to be out-foxed and avoided.

575
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,821
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

576
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,283
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

577
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,535
I'll probably be next.

578
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,953
We have each other.

579
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,873
Everything else is background noise.

580
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,751
You are exceptional.

581
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,718
My turn.

582
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,931
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

583
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:56,807
That's terrible.

584
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,268
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

585
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,811
How much?

586
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,189
Almost a million.

587
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,232
That's almost all of it.

588
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,568
This is where you say,
"Everything else is background noise."

589
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,776
Amy, if you're laid off...

590
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,071
and I'm laid off...

591
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,238
I said I'd do it.

592
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,531
Without talking to me?

593
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,158
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

594
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,910
...their money, technically.

595
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,999
You know what? You're right.

596
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,627
Everything else
is just background noise.

597
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,595
Hey.

598
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,767
More games?

599
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,560
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

600
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,230
What's the laptop for?

601
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,315
Laptop-ing.

602
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,360
I see.

603
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,530
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

604
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,673
but God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

605
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,742
You are spending a lot.

606
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,953
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

607
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,681
You certainly don't trust my intention.

608
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,539
What are you talking about?

609
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,207
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

610
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,501
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

611
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,086
Because it's easy to throw.

612
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:07,920
Nick, I don't get it.

613
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,298
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

614
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,427
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

615
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,846
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

616
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,055
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,543
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

618
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,476
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

619
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,645
You'll get another job.

620
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,276
Hi, Go.

621
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,654
What? Hold on. What?

622
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,114
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

623
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,158
...I knew everything
was about to get worse.

624
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,909
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

625
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,772
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

626
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,732
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

627
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,025
Nick, good to see you.

628
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,193
Good to see you.

629
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,486
Hey, guys, hey.

630
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,406
- Jodie.
- Nick.

631
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,743
Oh, we'll find her.

632
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,301
You look like hammered shit.

633
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,136
Thank you.

634
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,949
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

635
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,233
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

636
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,068
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

637
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,236
Do-gooders?

638
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,403
Freaks.

639
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,405
Hey, I meant to ask you.

640
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,032
Noelle Hawthorne?

641
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,629
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

642
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,954
I've never heard the name
Noelle Hawthorne.

643
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,164
She and her husband have triplets.

644
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,332
Oh.

645
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,460
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

646
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,004
But "best friend"? No.

647
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,756
Excuse me, one sec.

648
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,012
He acted like
Noelle was a complete stranger.

649
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,264
Of course he did.

650
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,807
Look, these two are yours.

651
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,226
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

652
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,186
so everybody can see him
being a good guy.

653
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,021
You really don't like him, do you?

654
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,690
What's to like?

655
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,882
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

656
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,427
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's Shawna Kelly.

657
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,263
I am so sorry for your troubles.

658
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,222
Thank you. That's kind.

659
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,682
Are you remembering to eat?

660
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,850
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

661
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:12,062
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken Frito pie.

662
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,750
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

663
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,399
You have to keep your strength.

664
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,942
Would you...

665
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,695
say, "Chicken Frito pie!"

666
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,200
You know what?

667
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,703
Would you delete that picture for me?

668
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,622
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

669
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,081
But just do me a favor.

670
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,875
Will you?

671
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,836
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

672
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,004
You just press...

673
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,422
What is wrong with you?

674
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,757
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

675
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,260
I will share it with whomever I please.

676
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,307
- Dude.
- Yeah?

677
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,808
Marybeth is pissed.

678
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,518
Why?

679
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,648
Marybeth?

680
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,234
It's like you're the goddamn
Homecoming King.

681
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,989
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

682
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,950
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

683
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,701
It looked like you were having fun.

684
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,120
I am in a nightmare!

685
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,123
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

686
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,002
to the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

687
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,714
You're right.

688
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,550
And I'm sorry.

689
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,181
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

690
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,362
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

691
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,947
No.

692
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,658
How about a brand new Stratocaster?

693
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,951
No, nothing like that.

694
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,745
Well, all right.

695
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,670
How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.

696
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,005
No, it's nowhere near that.

697
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,256
Okay.

698
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,008
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

699
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,135
He asked me to feed his cat.

700
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,511
I saw some in the pantry.

701
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:12,474
Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?
Noelle Hawthorne!

702
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,101
I know y'all are in there!

703
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,772
Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

704
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,608
Detective Boney!

705
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,612
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

706
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,168
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

707
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,550
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

708
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,678
How's Marybeth?

709
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,555
She's a wreck.

710
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,182
And you?

711
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,309
Awesome.

712
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,477
Hey...

713
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,062
have you told me everything?

714
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,313
Of course.

715
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,314
Everything?

716
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,356
Why would you even ask me that?

717
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,694
Ever since you walked into The Bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

718
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,988
- off.
- I am off.

719
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,242
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

720
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,704
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

721
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,081
and not be judged.

722
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,749
Can we do that?

723
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,168
Of course.

724
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,421
You know what I keep thinking?

725
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,589
If Mom were here?

726
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,093
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

727
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,347
Nick, Mom would fix it.

728
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,774
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

729
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,029
- Love you.
- Love you.

730
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,285
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

731
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,914
I am a Missourian.

732
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,089
Bye, Dad.

733
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,344
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

734
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,555
And then, we heard from Go.

735
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,515
Mama Maureen...

736
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,518
Stage 4 breast cancer.

737
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,398
So, we moved to Missouri.

738
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,066
I don't mind.

739
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,403
I just wish he'd asked.

740
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,500
Nick is happy to be home.

741
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,086
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

742
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:50,716
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

743
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,927
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

744
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,305
Something disposable.

745
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,767
I feel like I could disappear.

746
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,647
Oh, my God!

747
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,649
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

748
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,359
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

749
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,611
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

750
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,488
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

751
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,365
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

752
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,532
Rehearsals.

753
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,617
What?

754
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,993
Godspell.

755
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,309
My sister's asleep in the other room.

756
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,456
I needed to see you.

757
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,166
I know this is a bad idea.

758
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,814
Can you at least tell me you love me?

759
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,505
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

760
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:12,798
I've been so scared.

761
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,049
Between rehearsals?

762
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,842
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

763
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,386
I know.

764
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,679
We need to stop.

765
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,013
I need you.

766
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,975
Touch me.

767
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,022
Stop it. Come here.

768
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,984
Sit down.

769
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,360
Okay.

770
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,489
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

771
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,032
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

772
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,868
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

773
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,996
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

774
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,748
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

775
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,210
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

776
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,378
Sweetheart, think.

777
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,714
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

778
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,383
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

779
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,218
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

780
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,845
Until when?

781
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,722
Until it's safe.

782
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,348
You were going to get a divorce.

783
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,559
Never say that out loud again.

784
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,395
Okay. I'm sorry.

785
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,272
I don't wanna fight.

786
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,734
I just wanna be with you.

787
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,068
Andie, please...

788
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,571
That's all I want.

789
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,990
I can't.

790
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,453
It's our last time together.

791
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,663
Let's make the most of it.

792
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,757
Real quick, but then you have to go.

793
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,262
My husband has come undone.

794
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,265
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

795
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,143
but as it turns out, we couldn't.

796
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,190
It means a lot that you came.

797
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,719
We took a hit on the brownstone...

798
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,111
and I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

799
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,114
So far, it's just costing money.

800
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,122
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

801
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,795
Otherwise, I don't exist.

802
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,006
We should go to Outback tonight.

803
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,299
That would be nice.

804
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,552
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

805
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,515
I became someone I don't even like.

806
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,475
The kind of woman I used to mock.

807
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,477
You're out so much.

808
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,854
- I know.
- Stay home.

809
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,232
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

810
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,067
You would hate it.

811
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,487
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

812
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,366
Do our code. No bullshit.

813
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,202
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

814
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,544
Okay, bye.

815
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,048
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

816
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,591
Something positive.

817
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,052
Maybe it's time.

818
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,055
Now is literally the worst time.

819
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,463
It would be a new start for us.

820
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,268
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

821
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,519
A child is not a hobby.

822
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,687
Not a hobby.

823
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,897
An inspiration.

824
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,443
We could have had this fight
4 hours ago. I'm late.

825
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,735
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

826
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,197
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

827
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,365
"Save"?

828
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,909
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

829
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,120
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

830
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,706
You're a fucking coward.

831
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,624
No, it can't go on like this.

832
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,792
Really?

833
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,252
- I won't.
- You won't?

834
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,629
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

835
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,589
It's not even close!

836
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,883
You stupid bitch!

837
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,303
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

838
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:50,307
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

839
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,726
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

840
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,397
I am frightened of my own husband.

841
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,660
You want me to call for backup?

842
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,913
Nah, I'll protect you.

843
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,088
Jesus.

844
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,804
They ought to burn this place down.

845
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,932
Seems like folks are trying.

846
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,606
You really think this is anything?

847
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,942
Cross it off the list.

848
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,621
Hey, Jason.

849
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,206
What's up, Rhonda?

850
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,625
"...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men..."

851
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,212
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

852
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,297
She was reported missing.

853
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,219
"...and so dedicated, can long endure."

854
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,179
Yeah. I remember her.

855
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,473
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

856
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,142
She wanted a gun.

857
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,311
I told her it's not my thing.

858
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,356
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

859
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,985
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

860
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,861
Are you sure this is her?

861
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,155
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

862
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,533
She was all in pink.

863
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,244
It was Valentine's Day.

864
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,833
For Valentine's Day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

865
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,586
That is how crazy I've become.

866
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,674
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

867
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:51,845
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

868
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,513
The bitch with the prenup.

869
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,559
I could go home to my parents...

870
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,020
but I'd have to tell them the truth.

871
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,898
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

872
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,860
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

873
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,863
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

874
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,198
It's just...

875
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,702
I'd sleep better with a gun.

876
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,881
Oh, shit.

877
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,676
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

878
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,266
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

879
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,561
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

880
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,855
Just get that.

881
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,026
Be very careful.

882
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:49,861
I'm all right.

883
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,364
Here you go.

884
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,282
Promise me we'll talk everyday.

885
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,575
Okay, we will.

886
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,453
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

887
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,246
Don't go crazy.

888
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,623
Okay.

889
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,255
You fucking idiot.

890
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,259
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

891
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,304
I'm sorry.

892
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,099
How old is she?

893
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,642
She's in her early 20s.

894
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
How long?

895
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,772
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

896
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,620
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

897
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,109
It's so fucking small.

898
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,112
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like Dad!

899
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,446
How did you even meet her?

900
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,823
She's one of my students.

901
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,617
I thought writers hated cliche.

902
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:38,493
I'm not a writer.

903
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,861
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

904
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,623
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

905
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,583
how fucking terrible she made me feel.

906
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,795
Flyover Boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

907
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,672
just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

908
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,000
dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

909
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,300
This is so bad.

910
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,428
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

911
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,097
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

912
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,807
where, occasionally, Andie and I...

913
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,267
I don't know what the fuck it means.

914
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,476
Are they Super-Twat's?

915
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,603
Her name is Andie.

916
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,147
She's not entirely sure.

917
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,874
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

918
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,316
who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

919
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,684
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

920
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,362
and she left them there for me to find.

921
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,158
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

922
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,493
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

923
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,663
and this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

924
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:24,998
Can you imagine?

925
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,835
Have you watched television lately?

926
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:32,005
Cable news is all over your shit.

927
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,340
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

928
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,676
His wife's nowhere to be found...

929
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:40,388
and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

930
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,891
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

931
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,851
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

932
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,019
She was trying to give me a casserole.

933
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,189
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt...

934
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,900
patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.

935
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,570
Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick Dunne?

936
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,738
Well, let me just say...

937
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,532
as always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

938
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,242
But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.

939
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,935
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

940
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,371
that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

941
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,750
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

942
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,877
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

943
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,046
to behave normally in this situation...

944
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,840
because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

945
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,551
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

946
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,845
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

947
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,681
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

948
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,935
You need to hire Tanner Bolt.

949
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:29,687
I don't deserve this.

950
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,606
Innocent until proven guilty.

951
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,025
That's exactly what you deserve.

952
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,735
Go home, Nick.

953
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,137
Hey, buddy.

954
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,789
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

955
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,699
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

956
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,427
just because some blonde dunce says so.

957
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,287
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

958
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,790
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

959
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,750
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

960
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,085
She was trying to buy a gun.

961
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,296
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, Gil.

962
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,463
Give me the update.

963
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,466
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

964
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,594
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

965
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,221
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

966
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,431
- Hey.
- Hey.

967
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,893
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

968
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,227
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

969
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,395
The blood is profuse.

970
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,647
It is Amy's, type B,
and we should have DNA soon.

971
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,815
Thoughts on a weapon?

972
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,734
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

973
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,236
Maybe a club or a 2-by-4.

974
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,948
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

975
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,408
Amy's medical records come in?

976
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,577
No, we'll have them later tonight.

977
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,580
My wife says he's a killer.

978
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,166
Well, if Tiffany says...

979
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,776
Hey.

980
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,110
Hey.

981
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,692
Thank you all for coming out.

982
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,869
Hey Donnie, how are you?

983
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,373
Rich, thank you so much.

984
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,673
Hey.

985
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,183
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

986
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,143
It just means the world to our family.

987
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,145
And to Amy.

988
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,731
As you all know...

989
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,735
my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...

990
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,404
disappeared 3 days ago.

991
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,408
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

992
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,369
please come forward. Help us.

993
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,328
So hot.

994
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,746
He is so creepy.

995
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:37,250
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

996
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,335
and are too polite to ask.

997
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,922
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

998
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,341
I'm cooperating with the police.

999
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,427
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1000
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,720
I have nothing to hide.

1001
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,515
Amy is my soul mate.

1002
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,058
She is brilliant...

1003
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,687
she's charming, and wise.

1004
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,731
I love you, Amy.

1005
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:04,944
Asshole.

1006
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,197
I love my wife...

1007
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,782
so much.

1008
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:16,622
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1009
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,126
and if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1010
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,880
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1011
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,966
but don't harass
the people of this town.

1012
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,052
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1013
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,303
Nick!

1014
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,631
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1015
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,098
Where's your wife, Nick?

1016
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,767
Let the police do their jobs.

1017
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,810
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1018
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,806
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1019
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,982
Did you tell them
Amy was 6 weeks pregnant?

1020
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,905
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1021
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,715
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1022
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,164
Gil, go, go.

1023
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,541
Nick, where are you going?

1024
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,127
Stop him!

1025
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,505
No questions right now. Thank you.

1026
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,550
Why are you running away?

1027
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,053
Don't run.

1028
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,138
Everybody, stay back.

1029
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,978
Guys, come on. You know better.

1030
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,481
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1031
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,941
- Hey, Gil...
- On it.

1032
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,109
All right.

1033
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,944
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1034
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,320
Hello?

1035
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,489
Hello?

1036
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,365
Fuck.

1037
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,908
You scared me. Want a drink?

1038
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,451
Did you know she was pregnant?

1039
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,620
I told you,
Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1040
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,830
She doesn't even know Amy.

1041
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,098
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1042
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,968
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1043
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,219
We have her medical records coming.

1044
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,138
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1045
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,390
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1046
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,309
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1047
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,311
Dozens and dozens.

1048
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,564
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1049
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,900
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1050
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,239
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1051
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,283
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1052
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,951
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1053
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,119
No.

1054
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,246
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1055
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,957
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1056
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,251
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1057
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,419
Oh, my God.

1058
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,628
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1059
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,131
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1060
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,899
if they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1061
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,552
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1062
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,013
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1063
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,472
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1064
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,601
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1065
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,644
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1066
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,397
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1067
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,445
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is Noelle.

1068
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,985
She says, "Not good."

1069
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,528
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1070
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,697
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1071
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,490
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1072
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,869
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1073
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,622
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1074
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,624
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1075
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,667
There are these fun little splurges.

1076
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,252
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1077
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,420
I don't even golf!

1078
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:10,796
I do! You bought great clubs.

1079
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,131
I like the robot dog.

1080
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,133
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1081
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,134
We need to find out who did this!

1082
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,982
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1083
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,513
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1084
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,681
to $1.2 million.

1085
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,975
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1086
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,185
You filed the paperwork.

1087
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,561
Because she told me to!

1088
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,188
Hold on a sec.

1089
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,148
Yeah? Okay.

1090
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,235
For sure?

1091
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,819
All right.

1092
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:38,908
She was pregnant.

1093
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,497
This is insane.

1094
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,041
So, my question becomes...

1095
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,002
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1096
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,337
without a lawyer.

1097
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,680
Margo!

1098
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,566
Hey.

1099
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,238
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1100
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:18,197
Nick?

1101
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,033
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1102
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,037
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1103
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,582
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1104
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,087
You want to know the truth?

1105
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,631
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1106
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,094
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1107
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,222
You told me you didn't want kids.

1108
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,624
I was trying to put a good face on.

1109
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,393
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1110
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,769
That's a problem for you.

1111
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,897
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1112
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,399
Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

1113
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,900
You have to fucking talk to me!

1114
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:01,490
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1115
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,743
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1116
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,661
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1117
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,913
- Lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1118
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,241
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1119
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,834
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1120
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,002
Masturbate.

1121
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,670
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1122
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,255
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1123
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,424
Now, who would believe you?

1124
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,801
All right.

1125
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,104
This is a letter from the clinic...

1126
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,607
notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1127
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,776
unless I contact them.

1128
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,445
So, I gave it to Amy.

1129
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,490
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1130
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,116
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1131
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,994
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1132
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:51,332
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1133
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,632
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just..."

1134
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,050
This is the clue you couldn't solve.

1135
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,343
Yeah.

1136
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,306
A letter from Desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1137
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,755
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1138
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,727
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1139
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,895
Your prenup?

1140
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,065
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1141
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,025
I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!

1142
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,906
I love you no matter what.

1143
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,324
But you need to tell me.

1144
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,909
Tell you what?

1145
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,370
What are you asking me?

1146
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,125
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, Go?

1147
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,664
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1148
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,130
I would never ask you that!

1149
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,093
Margo!

1150
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,108
Don't walk on the glass.

1151
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,446
You have no clue, do you?

1152
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,840
Why was he here that night?

1153
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:27,178
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1154
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,345
Who cares?

1155
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,680
Rhonda, we got this.

1156
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,223
Let's make the arrest.

1157
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,350
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1158
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,351
No.

1159
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,520
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1160
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,440
So, I want one last thing.

1161
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:40,608
What's that?

1162
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,528
I want a body.

1163
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,992
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1164
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,785
Be careful.

1165
01:03:56,333 --> 01:04:00,753
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

1166
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,300
Fuck.

1167
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,096
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary 5.

1168
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,391
So, open the door...

1169
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,809
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1170
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,479
...and look alive.

1171
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,193
Punish. Wood.

1172
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,946
Wood.

1173
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,647
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1174
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,233
and will love this baby.

1175
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,529
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1176
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,864
But I could be wrong.

1177
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,956
Because sometimes...

1178
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,167
the way he looks at me...

1179
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,878
I think...

1180
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,130
man of my dreams...

1181
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,134
father of my child...

1182
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,930
this man of mine may kill me.

1183
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,309
He may truly...

1184
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,227
kill me.

1185
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:43,939
WTF?

1186
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,467
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1187
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,098
Technically, "missing."

1188
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,601
Soon to be presumed dead.

1189
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,437
Gone.

1190
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,524
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1191
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,986
will go to prison for my murder.

1192
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,698
Nick Dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1193
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,242
and my hope and my money.

1194
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,871
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1195
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,331
That's murder.

1196
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,292
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1197
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,879
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1198
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:56,095
You befriend a local idiot.

1199
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:02,810
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1200
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,772
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1201
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,192
Secretly create some money troubles.

1202
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,612
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1203
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,325
With the help of the unwitting...

1204
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,494
bump up your life insurance.

1205
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,249
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1206
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,711
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1207
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:33,674
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1208
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,802
And America loves pregnant women.

1209
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:40,013
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1210
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,473
You know what's hard?

1211
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,809
Faking a pregnancy.

1212
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,145
First, drain your toilet.

1213
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:50,482
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1214
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,152
and ply her with lemonade.

1215
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,492
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1216
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,079
Voila.

1217
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:08,208
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1218
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,049
Happy anniversary.

1219
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,346
Wait for your clueless husband...

1220
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,390
to start his day.

1221
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,185
Off he goes.

1222
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,520
And the clock is ticking.

1223
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,191
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1224
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:36,862
with just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1225
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,240
You need to bleed.

1226
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,575
A lot.

1227
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,869
A lot, a lot.

1228
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:49,041
A head wound kind of bleed.

1229
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,211
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,216
You need to clean poorly...

1231
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,383
like he would.

1232
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,595
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1233
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,807
And leave a little something behind.

1234
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,226
A fire in July?

1235
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,770
And because you're you...

1236
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,146
you don't stop there.

1237
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,649
You need a diary.

1238
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,735
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1239
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,571
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1240
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,907
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1241
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,076
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1242
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,912
After that, you invent.

1243
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
The spending.

1244
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,748
The abuse. The fear.

1245
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,751
The threat of violence.

1246
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,878
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1247
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,880
Burn it just the right amount.

1248
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,592
Make sure the cops will find it.

1249
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,642
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1250
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,981
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1251
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,650
for killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1252
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,319
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1253
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,487
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1254
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,907
and a pocket full of stones.

1255
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,743
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1256
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,080
Nick Dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1257
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,457
And she floated down
past all the other...

1258
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,961
abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1259
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,298
Then, Nick will die, too.

1260
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,925
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1261
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,094
But, then, we never really existed.

1262
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,347
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1263
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,515
"Cool Girl."

1264
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:32,686
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1265
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:33,854
"She's a cool girl."

1266
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,981
Cool Girl is hot.

1267
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,441
Cool Girl is game.

1268
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,609
Cool Girl is fun.

1269
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,320
Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.

1270
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,114
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1271
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,618
and then presents her mouth for fucking.

1272
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,661
She likes what he likes.

1273
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,290
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1274
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,502
If he likes Girls Gone Wild,
she's a mall babe...

1275
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,340
who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1276
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,968
When I met Nick Dunne,
I knew he wanted Cool Girl.

1277
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,679
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1278
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,848
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1279
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,644
I drank canned beer
watching Adam Sandler movies.

1280
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,521
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1281
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,690
I blew him semi-regularly.

1282
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,360
I lived in the moment.

1283
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:24,196
I was fucking game.

1284
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,865
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1285
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,869
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1286
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:34,206
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1287
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:37,167
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1288
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,837
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1289
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:44,758
I forged the man of my dreams.

1290
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:49,888
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1291
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,890
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1292
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,520
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1293
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,272
But Nick got lazy.

1294
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,525
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1295
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,861
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1296
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,908
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1297
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,912
and found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1298
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,080
Cool Girl.

1299
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:21,586
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1300
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,755
No fucking way.

1301
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,924
He doesn't get to win.

1302
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:40,230
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1303
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,110
He needed to learn.

1304
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,447
Grown-ups work for things.

1305
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,949
Grown-ups pay.

1306
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,911
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1307
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,624
Wait.

1308
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,669
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1309
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,463
or get angry.

1310
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,466
Okay.

1311
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,263
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1312
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,475
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary 5?

1313
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,309
Wood.

1314
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,479
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1315
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,148
That fucking bitch.

1316
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,224
- I thought...
- It's all right.

1317
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,819
I would have, too.

1318
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,365
What's that present?

1319
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,159
I don't know.

1320
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,286
Let's find out.

1321
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:46,671
"Dear Husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1322
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,159
"Don't believe that for a second.

1323
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,580
"I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going."

1324
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,722
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1325
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,641
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1326
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:00,393
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1327
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,853
What's "up, up river"?

1328
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,022
"Up the river." Prison.

1329
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,024
Fucking crazy bitch.

1330
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,692
That's what this is.

1331
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,028
She's framing me for her murder.

1332
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,363
You married a complete psychopath.

1333
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,490
The morning of our anniversary...

1334
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,869
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1335
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,372
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1336
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,331
Then what happened?

1337
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,666
Before I could say anything, she said...

1338
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:26,086
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage."

1339
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,379
She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.

1340
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:28,713
So you'd have no alibi.

1341
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,091
She stage-managed me.

1342
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,928
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1343
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,513
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1344
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,361
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1345
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,672
And by the time you got home...

1346
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,226
She was gone.

1347
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:42,602
You fuck!

1348
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,354
She's good.

1349
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,232
Part of me was relieved...

1350
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,693
when I thought she was gone.

1351
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,782
Punch and Judy puppets.

1352
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,746
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1353
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,039
So I'm Punch.

1354
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,042
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1355
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,046
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1356
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,366
Hey, neighbor.

1357
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,661
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1358
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,789
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1359
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,959
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 AM...

1360
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,003
we're gonna be best friends.

1361
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,130
All right. Nice meeting you.

1362
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,882
I'm Greta.

1363
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,675
I'm Nancy.

1364
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,677
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1365
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,137
I'm sorry. I can't.

1366
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,513
I've got work to do.

1367
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,849
All right. See you around!

1368
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,060
You will.

1369
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:56,236
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1370
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,906
You asshole.

1371
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,881
Hey.

1372
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,428
Nancy.

1373
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:25,557
Nancy.

1374
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,768
It's hot again today.

1375
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,897
So, where are you from?

1376
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,566
Let me guess.

1377
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:38,695
Nebraska.

1378
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,115
New Orleans.

1379
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,954
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1380
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,789
Oh, I just bet you are.

1381
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,584
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1382
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,086
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1383
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,255
So sweet.

1384
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,759
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1385
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,056
I see we have the same taste in men.

1386
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,893
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1387
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,104
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1388
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,398
Let me guess.

1389
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,444
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1390
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,447
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1391
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:23,615
I got it.

1392
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,950
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1393
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,118
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1394
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,498
Worse.

1395
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,624
Worse?

1396
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:37,045
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1397
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:41,925
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1398
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,888
On the very first night that we met...

1399
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:51,309
we walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1400
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,396
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1401
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,731
A sugar storm.

1402
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,900
And before he kissed me...

1403
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,152
he leaned in...

1404
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,948
and did this.

1405
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,961
- And guess what.
- What?

1406
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:19,838
He did the exact same thing with her.

1407
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,970
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1408
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:28,847
Thank you.

1409
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,196
Thanks very much.

1410
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,289
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1411
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,891
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1412
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,185
Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?

1413
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,354
Nick Dunne.

1414
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,815
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1415
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,403
I'm sorry.

1416
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,280
Do you not believe me?

1417
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,575
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1418
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:34,078
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1419
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,957
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1420
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,584
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1421
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,377
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1422
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,879
I'm way in.

1423
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,548
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1424
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:49,010
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1425
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,720
$100,000?

1426
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,305
We'll figure something out.

1427
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:53,513
I'll give you a special...

1428
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,309
"my wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1429
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,477
Okay.

1430
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,062
So, what's the plan?

1431
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,980
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1432
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,483
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1433
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,485
She is telling the perfect story.

1434
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,947
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1435
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,514
- And if we decide to go with your version of...
- The truth.

1436
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,620
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1437
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,914
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1438
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:21,417
and see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1439
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:25,672
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1440
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,966
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1441
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,094
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1442
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,513
8 years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1443
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,848
That should be easy to find.

1444
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,644
Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1445
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,692
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1446
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:45,233
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1447
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,532
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1448
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,952
Apparently.

1449
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,671
Tommy?

1450
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,381
Yeah.

1451
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,758
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,555
You're gonna want a drink.

1453
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,307
Yeah.

1454
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,143
So, she said you got physical with her.

1455
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,146
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1456
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,690
First degree, felony rape.

1457
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,151
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1458
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,404
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1459
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,364
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1460
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,617
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1461
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,703
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1462
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,663
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1463
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,123
I've been unemployed
for the last 8 years...

1464
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,667
because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1465
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:47,795
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1466
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:51,174
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1467
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,053
Could you walk me through what happened?

1468
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:58,348
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1469
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,016
We click. She's perfect.

1470
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,393
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1471
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,729
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1472
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,564
I think, "What's the catch?"

1473
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,901
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1474
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,488
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1475
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,991
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1476
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,828
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1477
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,081
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1478
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,875
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1479
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,712
- So, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1480
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,548
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1481
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,258
So I thought.

1482
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,594
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1483
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,555
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1484
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,600
And within 2 minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1485
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,227
and she is kneeling down, and...

1486
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,270
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1487
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,189
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1488
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,441
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1489
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,236
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1490
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,364
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1491
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,575
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1492
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,287
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1493
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,789
Me!

1494
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,582
And then, guess what they find.

1495
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,793
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1496
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,420
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1497
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,921
You do know your wife.

1498
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,298
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1499
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,883
On TV, last week, with you.

1500
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,760
I thought, "There's Amy.

1501
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,931
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered."

1502
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,889
You been watching this, too?

1503
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,062
Last night's bombshell.

1504
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,230
We just found out...

1505
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,150
Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1506
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,486
Kelly Capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1507
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,489
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1508
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:39,991
that turns men into animals?

1509
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,659
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1510
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,152
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1511
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,497
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1512
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,417
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1513
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,504
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
Noelle Hawthorne.

1514
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,923
Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.

1515
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,258
Thank you, Ellen.

1516
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,801
And let me just say this...

1517
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,430
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1518
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,598
Oh, that's nice.

1519
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,683
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, Noelle?

1520
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,269
Amy was so nurturing.

1521
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,688
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1522
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,148
"She was a real rag."

1523
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,111
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1524
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,197
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1525
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,866
What do you mean? People love her.

1526
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,452
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1527
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,539
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1528
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:29,791
Paid the ultimate price.

1529
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,294
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1530
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,962
He never introduced himself.

1531
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,381
Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?

1532
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,549
I think we know why.

1533
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,469
Because he had a violent temper.

1534
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,637
A little harsh.

1535
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,180
That's life, baby.

1536
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:45,908
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1537
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,059
Don't get me wrong.

1538
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,977
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1539
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,564
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1540
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:56,692
Fuck, yeah.

1541
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,028
She was so alone.

1542
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,988
And she was so innocent.

1543
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,492
You're a good friend, Noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1544
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,743
Thanks for coming on.

1545
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,245
Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.

1546
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,580
Tanner Bolt landed me.

1547
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,917
I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings
on my way home.

1548
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,919
And, Go...

1549
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,256
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1550
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,174
That's just the retainer.

1551
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:24,053
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an IRA.

1552
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,181
I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.

1553
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,100
Thank you.

1554
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,394
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1555
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:34,188
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1556
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,440
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1557
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:37,608
Oh, fuck!

1558
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,194
His twin sister, Margo,
well, she is a peach.

1559
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,697
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1560
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:45,283
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1561
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,450
What the fuck?

1562
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,287
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1563
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,622
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1564
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,542
they both seem very, very close.

1565
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,127
It's twin-cest.

1566
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,046
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1567
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,090
And so, we close with a question.

1568
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,633
What kind of moral rot...

1569
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:07,388
allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1570
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,142
to vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1571
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,310
Can I bum a cigarette?

1572
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,147
Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1573
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,733
And you know what else we won't forget?

1574
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:21,152
Missouri has the death penalty.

1575
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,486
Amen.

1576
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,514
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1577
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,185
near the woodshed
on the property of one Margo Dunne.

1578
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:36,852
Hey.

1579
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,527
- Mr. Dunne.
- Mr. Collings.

1580
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,489
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1581
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,366
I wanted to help.

1582
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,743
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1583
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:55,997
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1584
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,251
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1585
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:04,255
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1586
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,090
everything.

1587
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,551
You were together for 2 years
in boarding school, right?

1588
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,761
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1589
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,597
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1590
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,599
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1591
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,851
That's a rude question.

1592
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,602
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1593
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,605
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1594
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,733
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1595
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,278
and you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1596
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,240
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1597
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,617
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1598
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,123
Mr. Collings.

1599
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,127
Fuck.

1600
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,635
...the missing persons case
of Amy Elliott Dunne.

1601
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:55,473
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.

1602
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,742
You're reading that diary again?

1603
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,910
You know how it ends.

1604
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,329
It interests me.

1605
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,955
Hey, Rhonda.

1606
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,916
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1607
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,085
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1608
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,252
It's private. There's no one there.

1609
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,089
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1610
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,092
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1611
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,469
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1612
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,596
Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."

1613
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,764
You ever hear the expression...

1614
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,772
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1615
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,352
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1616
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,312
- Good night.
- Good night.

1617
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:46,982
Hey.

1618
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,202
Elvis is in Missouri.

1619
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,371
Thank God. Come on in.

1620
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:03,419
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1621
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,876
- Play God.
- Yeah, Old Testament God.

1622
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,044
Okay. Keep talking.

1623
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,712
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1624
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,339
decides to teach me a lesson.

1625
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,299
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1626
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,552
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1627
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,803
She does the treasure hunt.

1628
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,179
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1629
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:20,891
She's taking us on a tour of my
infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1630
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,977
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1631
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,745
which will lead them
back to my office...

1632
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,314
which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1633
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,691
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1634
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:29,900
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1635
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,652
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1636
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,071
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1637
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,489
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1638
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,032
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1639
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,826
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1640
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,370
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1641
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,746
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1642
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,332
Nick, Margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1643
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,168
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1644
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,086
Dad's house is blue.

1645
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,424
After the divorce,
when Dad wasn't coming around...

1646
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:57,887
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. Brown, who...

1647
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:01,599
for the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1648
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,184
You never told me that.

1649
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,102
You told her that?

1650
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,563
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1651
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:10,298
We've got a Showcase Showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1652
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:14,612
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1653
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,779
And be honest.

1654
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:17,740
I honestly have no idea.

1655
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:28,626
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1656
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,713
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1657
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,050
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1658
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:38,928
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1659
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,304
Okay. Amy's parents?

1660
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:41,931
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1661
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:45,226
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1662
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,873
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1663
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:48,646
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1664
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,315
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1665
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,817
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1666
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,153
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1667
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,155
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1668
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,740
We need to be on the front end of that.

1669
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,243
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1670
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:03,911
They'll go after Margo.

1671
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:04,954
They can't do that, can they?

1672
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,914
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1673
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,166
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1674
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,502
God.

1675
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,796
Well, what are we going to do?

1676
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:14,964
We find Amy.

1677
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:17,466
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1678
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,874
I've got two ex-Secret Service guys
that are really good.

1679
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,512
I'll put them on it.

1680
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,097
But where do they start, Nick?

1681
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,598
Where would Amy go?

1682
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,394
I have no idea.

1683
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,484
Are we keeping score?

1684
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,528
Hey!

1685
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,199
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1686
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:43,367
He's nice.

1687
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,869
Because he wants to fuck you.

1688
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,039
She's still moping about her ex?

1689
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,502
He got cheated on, too.

1690
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,633
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.

1691
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,343
I'm not sad.

1692
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:02,886
I'm angry.

1693
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,555
There you go.

1694
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,224
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1695
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,518
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1696
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:10,806
Don't give him the pleasure.

1697
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,856
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1698
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:16,400
let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1699
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,235
Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.

1700
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:22,197
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1701
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,825
Please put that on a T-shirt.

1702
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,753
Miss Moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1703
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,547
That's a fat wad.

1704
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:42,009
It's mostly singles.

1705
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:44,053
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1706
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,431
Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?

1707
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:49,600
We're just teasing.

1708
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,186
Don't they tease people down in NOLA?

1709
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,441
We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest
any day now.

1710
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:01,195
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1711
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:05,199
And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,
missing for 5 days...

1712
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,493
crying out for justice.

1713
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,995
We'll be right back.

1714
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,716
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1715
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:05,551
Yeah?

1716
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,177
You're doing Sharon Schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1717
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:08,345
It could go so wrong.

1718
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,028
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1719
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,348
Nope.

1720
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,392
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1721
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,519
You haven't heard from her
in 3 days.

1722
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:19,273
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1723
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:21,881
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1724
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,361
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1725
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,196
People empathize with that.

1726
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,408
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1727
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:32,536
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1728
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:35,080
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1729
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:37,040
She's going to ask real questions.

1730
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,917
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1731
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,419
What to say, what not to say.

1732
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:41,587
A trained monkey?

1733
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,874
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1734
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:48,469
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1735
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,262
They need to like you.

1736
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,266
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1737
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,936
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1738
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:08,071
Hello?

1739
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,448
Hey, baby.

1740
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:12,493
One minute.

1741
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:22,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

1742
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:23,754
You clearing out?

1743
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,464
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1744
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:27,090
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1745
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,258
I'll come by before...

1746
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,093
Let us give you a hand.

1747
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:38,727
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1748
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,106
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1749
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,736
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1750
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,923
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1751
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,410
A sock...

1752
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:59,122
or undies or what have you.

1753
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:05,295
You did a real good job.

1754
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,424
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1755
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:14,096
Look under her dress.

1756
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,765
He talked you into this?

1757
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:18,141
I talked him into it.

1758
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:20,310
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1759
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:24,356
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1760
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:27,484
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1761
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,987
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1762
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,197
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1763
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:34,612
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1764
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,833
Holy shit.

1765
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,547
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1766
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:50,215
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1767
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,743
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1768
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:28,962
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1769
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,660
I did not kill my wife.

1770
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:03,830
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1771
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:05,082
I didn't kill my wife.

1772
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,502
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1773
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,213
or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1774
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,215
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1775
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:16,677
Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1776
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:21,556
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1777
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:22,724
You both did.

1778
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,187
We both lost our jobs.

1779
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,773
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1780
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,359
who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1781
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,152
Your dad's scorched earth.

1782
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,862
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1783
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,072
Go on.

1784
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,616
For a while,
things had been building up.

1785
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:43,161
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1786
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:45,747
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1787
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,083
I had a moment of weakness.

1788
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,669
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1789
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,550
I disrespected my wife.

1790
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,636
And I disrespected my marriage.

1791
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,471
And I'll always regret it.

1792
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:02,931
That works.

1793
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:05,392
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1794
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,144
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1795
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:08,019
"Everything I do is wrong."

1796
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,230
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1797
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:13,275
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1798
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:16,653
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1799
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,573
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1800
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,741
You hate that watch.

1801
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,743
No, Go. I love that watch.

1802
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,786
Just like I love this tie.

1803
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,081
Just like I love my wife.

1804
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,696
It's you!

1805
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,865
It's you.

1806
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,701
I'm sorry.

1807
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:06,703
I'm sorry.

1808
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,498
Good God.

1809
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:11,041
Last week...

1810
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:16,713
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1811
01:42:17,048 --> 01:42:19,216
So, I disappeared.

1812
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,219
I lost the baby.

1813
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,387
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1814
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:28,475
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1815
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,393
Well, he is looking for you.

1816
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,896
He showed up on my doorstep
3 days ago.

1817
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:35,565
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1818
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:37,901
You saved them.

1819
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,402
Knowing you were out there...

1820
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,072
was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1821
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,490
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1822
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:44,825
No, I can't turn up now.

1823
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,078
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1824
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:52,082
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1825
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,084
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1826
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,256
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1827
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:00,423
It's utterly secluded.

1828
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,552
Why are you so good to me?

1829
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:04,928
You know why.

1830
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:06,096
Excuse me.

1831
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:07,264
I know you, don't I?

1832
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:08,098
No.

1833
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:10,100
You're one of the Nolan girls, right?

1834
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:13,019
No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.

1835
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:13,937
We should leave.

1836
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,188
Just a second.

1837
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:18,900
That was Boney. I'll call her later.

1838
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,944
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1839
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:22,237
Sharon! Hi.

1840
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:23,947
Hope this is worth my while.

1841
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:25,240
You're gonna be very happy.

1842
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:26,366
Sharon.

1843
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:28,618
Ms. Schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1844
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,787
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1845
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,956
No, I had some gummy bears.

1846
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:35,625
What the fuck?

1847
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:37,919
I'm sorry?

1848
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:42,090
We have a major shocking development
in the Amazing Amy disappearance.

1849
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:43,508
We go live to that story now.

1850
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:44,968
Oh, my God.

1851
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:48,805
You little slut.

1852
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:51,975
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1853
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,519
I met Nicholas Dunne...

1854
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:58,189
when he was my creative writing teacher
at Mill Valley.

1855
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,317
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1856
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:01,818
I am deeply ashamed...

1857
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,988
of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1858
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,948
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1859
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:08,992
I truly believed we were in love.

1860
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,994
Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.

1861
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:13,830
I know that is no excuse.

1862
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,165
No, it is not.

1863
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:19,544
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick Dunne would have killed for me.

1864
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,005
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1865
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:25,175
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1866
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,349
We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.

1867
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:34,559
That love ended today.

1868
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,353
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1869
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,189
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1870
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,316
We now absolutely believe...

1871
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,735
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1872
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,154
Our Amazing Amy.

1873
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,157
This just got very exciting.

1874
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,576
We need a moment.

1875
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:55,205
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1876
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:57,173
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1877
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,501
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1878
01:44:59,669 --> 01:45:01,309
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1879
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,254
This is a completely different dynamic.

1880
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:06,174
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1881
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,385
Just trust me.

1882
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,015
Okay.

1883
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,266
Great.

1884
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:17,560
Mic him.

1885
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,082
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1886
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:46,423
Thank you.

1887
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:48,758
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1888
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:49,926
Yeah, no kidding.

1889
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:57,600
Roll tape. 5... 4...

1890
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,394
3... 2...

1891
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:04,399
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1892
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:05,900
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

1893
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:09,112
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1894
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,600
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1895
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:13,491
Andie was really good TV.

1896
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:15,619
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1897
01:46:15,745 --> 01:46:16,745
Ride this out...

1898
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:19,664
and when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1899
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,291
But, until then...

1900
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,293
don't show your face.

1901
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:25,295
No problem.

1902
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,979
Welcome.

1903
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,691
Make yourself at home.

1904
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:50,695
I've got music, satellite...

1905
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:51,863
Netflix.

1906
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:52,864
He was her teacher!

1907
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:53,990
Roku.

1908
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,035
Internet, obviously.

1909
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:00,205
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1910
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:04,042
If there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1911
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,336
just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1912
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:09,506
Instead of the A-B-C's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1913
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:12,467
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1914
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,636
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1915
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:19,349
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1916
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:22,936
Not that I don't appreciate
Bait Shop Chic.

1917
01:47:24,105 --> 01:47:26,481
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1918
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:29,692
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1919
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,195
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1920
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,949
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1921
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:37,534
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1922
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:40,036
The bed is Savoir.

1923
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,455
You'll never get a better sleep.

1924
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:48,670
This is just what I need.

1925
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:52,048
I'm so exhausted.

1926
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:55,718
I'll leave you to it, then.

1927
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,223
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1928
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:04,227
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1929
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:06,229
There are cameras everywhere.

1930
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:09,149
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1931
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,316
Anyone...

1932
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,735
who is caught coming or going...

1933
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,574
will be recorded.

1934
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,870
You are more than safe.

1935
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:27,333
And I am not letting you get away again.

1936
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,672
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1937
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:17,550
I'm sorry.

1938
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,054
I need to feel safe.

1939
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:24,390
You are very safe.

1940
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:28,102
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1941
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,855
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1942
01:49:31,023 --> 01:49:33,024
It's hard for me.

1943
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:39,572
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1944
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,117
I know just what that feels like.

1945
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:46,037
You were never under my thumb.

1946
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:48,539
- On your leash.
- Never.

1947
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:50,208
A new start.

1948
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:53,127
Decent clothes.

1949
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:56,297
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1950
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,091
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1951
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:01,886
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1952
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:05,056
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.

1953
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,767
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1954
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:09,894
Nonsense.

1955
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:14,941
I'll be back.

1956
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:18,611
And I am looking forward...

1957
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:21,698
to my reunion with Amy Elliott.

1958
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,055
Great.

1959
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:49,058
Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.

1960
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:50,852
- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.

1961
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:56,024
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1962
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:59,986
but on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1963
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:03,865
Nick Dunne...

1964
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:07,410
you're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1965
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:10,038
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1966
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,664
I bought that tie.

1967
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:13,750
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1968
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,003
I did not kill my wife.

1969
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,088
I am not a murderer.

1970
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,049
But you were unfaithful.

1971
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:23,301
I was unfaithful.

1972
01:51:23,469 --> 01:51:25,011
And I am deeply ashamed.

1973
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:27,513
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1974
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,433
her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1975
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:35,396
believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1976
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,324
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1977
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,360
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1978
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,236
now that we know you're a liar.

1979
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,531
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1980
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:48,868
because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1981
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:51,371
But I don't care about that anymore.

1982
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,039
I just want to find my wife.

1983
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:55,625
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- Let me be clear.

1984
01:51:55,793 --> 01:52:00,088
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1985
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:01,422
I'm not a good guy.

1986
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,300
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1987
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,427
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1988
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:09,222
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1989
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,182
But what does that really mean to you?

1990
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,393
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1991
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:17,438
I met Amy Elliott 7 years ago.

1992
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,190
I was completely transfixed.

1993
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,442
Amy can do that to you.

1994
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,028
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1995
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,072
with mediocre aspirations.

1996
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,616
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1997
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:30,618
And I wanted her to love me...

1998
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,121
so I pretended to be better than I was.

1999
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:37,542
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2000
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,419
That guy who works harder.

2001
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:41,671
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2002
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:44,757
and loves with as much passion
as she does.

2003
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,217
But I failed her.

2004
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:48,496
Instead of doing what was right...

2005
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:50,930
I did what was easy.

2006
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:55,184
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2007
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:56,853
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2008
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,312
She is still alive.

2009
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:03,025
Will you look at that camera for me?

2010
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,195
Will you look in the lens...

2011
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,197
and talk to your wife?

2012
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:11,325
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2013
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:14,162
what would you like to say to her, Nick?

2014
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:20,001
Amy, I love you.

2015
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:23,379
You're the best person I've ever known.

2016
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:27,884
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2017
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:29,886
And if you come back, I promise...

2018
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:32,555
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2019
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:36,893
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2020
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,480
I love you.

2021
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:42,982
Come home.

2022
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:48,738
Here.

2023
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:56,370
Regardless of what you thought...

2024
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,581
What does it say?

2025
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,166
...I think we can all agree...

2026
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,709
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2027
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:02,919
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.

2028
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:04,206
They're going crazy for you.

2029
01:54:04,213 --> 01:54:08,591
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2030
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:10,259
And now they love me.

2031
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:13,262
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2032
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,348
He's certainly earned mine.

2033
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:17,266
What is it?

2034
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:23,272
I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.

2035
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:30,863
Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2036
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,115
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2037
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:37,870
but a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2038
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:39,288
Call Tanner.

2039
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:40,456
Okay. Fuck!

2040
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:46,045
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2041
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:48,377
Is that what this is about?

2042
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:54,428
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2043
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:56,764
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2044
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:58,307
Every time you said something stupid...

2045
01:54:58,475 --> 01:55:00,726
I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."

2046
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:03,312
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2047
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,480
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2048
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:05,648
None of that is mine.

2049
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:07,400
None of this was put here by me.

2050
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:10,987
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2051
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:14,156
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2052
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:15,408
Nick!

2053
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:19,579
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2054
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:30,339
Amy, it's time to move on.

2055
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:32,216
What can I do to help?

2056
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,343
I need some time to think.

2057
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,887
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2058
01:55:37,055 --> 01:55:39,515
20 years,
you have kept me dangling.

2059
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:43,352
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2060
01:55:44,062 --> 01:55:45,271
Follow that instinct.

2061
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:47,857
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2062
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,569
sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2063
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:57,617
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2064
01:56:00,037 --> 01:56:02,705
I understand what you're saying, Desi.

2065
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,583
I do.

2066
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,921
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2067
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:16,469
I've forgotten how to behave.

2068
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:24,393
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2069
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:27,146
and we'll work it out together.

2070
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:32,943
I just want you to be you again.

2071
01:56:40,786 --> 01:56:42,306
They only took Margo to fuck with you.

2072
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:43,913
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2073
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:46,832
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2074
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:49,251
What?

2075
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:52,755
We tell Boney very little.

2076
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,924
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2077
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:57,259
their only hope is a confession.

2078
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,261
So, you let them do all the talking.

2079
01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:01,430
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2080
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:03,974
The truth is my defense.

2081
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:10,940
Recognize these?

2082
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:12,942
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2083
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,777
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2084
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:17,446
Mommy, Daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2085
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:19,115
No.

2086
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,487
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2087
01:57:22,703 --> 01:57:25,955
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2088
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:29,238
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2089
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,168
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- Looks like it.

2090
01:57:31,336 --> 01:57:32,461
Our experts thought so, too.

2091
01:57:33,797 --> 01:57:35,506
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2092
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:37,341
Sure.

2093
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:41,971
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."

2094
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,099
Yeah, that's true.

2095
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:48,352
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2096
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:50,980
That is also true, yes.

2097
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:55,151
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2098
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:57,194
I hit her? No, never happened.

2099
01:57:57,362 --> 01:57:58,863
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

2100
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,114
I never touched her.

2101
01:58:02,534 --> 01:58:04,160
She tried to buy a gun.

2102
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,704
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2103
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,623
Shall I read the last entry?

2104
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:10,833
Sure.

2105
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,128
"This man may kill me."

2106
01:58:14,296 --> 01:58:16,380
In her own words,
"This man may kill me."

2107
01:58:16,548 --> 01:58:18,674
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2108
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:26,474
For future reference...

2109
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,851
the truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2110
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:30,060
Okay, I know.

2111
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:40,321
Judy's missing handle.

2112
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:44,033
Big as a 2-by-2, right?
Big as a club.

2113
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,827
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2114
01:58:46,995 --> 01:58:49,538
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2115
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:50,414
We bagged it.

2116
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:51,582
I've never seen that before either.

2117
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:54,251
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2118
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:56,504
So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...

2119
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:58,172
you're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2120
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,423
Do not say another word.

2121
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:00,925
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2122
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:15,606
More coffee?

2123
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,566
I'd love it.

2124
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:23,364
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the Cape?

2125
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:25,950
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2126
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:27,743
This reminds me of that.

2127
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:29,912
Never-ending holiday.

2128
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:33,541
You're not bored?

2129
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:35,084
Desi, how could I be bored?

2130
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:37,586
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2131
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:40,673
19th-century Impressionists,
quote Proust in French.

2132
01:59:41,049 --> 01:59:45,052
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2133
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,096
with one hand down his boxers.

2134
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,683
I really have to get going.

2135
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:54,353
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2136
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:02,027
My keys.

2137
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,243
Thank you.

2138
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,047
That's how the kids wear it.

2139
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:26,695
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2140
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:30,699
Hey.

2141
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:33,369
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2142
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:34,662
Yeah.

2143
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:36,705
Let's go.

2144
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:39,625
What does this mean?

2145
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:41,835
Well, you're out on bond.

2146
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:45,214
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2147
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,721
Keep your head down.

2148
02:02:08,154 --> 02:02:10,406
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2149
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:12,574
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2150
02:02:13,076 --> 02:02:14,702
She's air.

2151
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:19,707
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2152
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:19,349
Mr. Collings is home.

2153
02:03:19,517 --> 02:03:21,769
Hello, Mr. Collings.

2154
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:23,687
I've missed you.

2155
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:25,481
I've been thinking...

2156
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,108
I don't wanna be without you.

2157
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:31,028
Stay with me.

2158
02:03:31,196 --> 02:03:34,031
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2159
02:03:34,199 --> 02:03:36,492
Octopus and Scrabble?

2160
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:40,621
How long do you think until it's done?

2161
02:03:40,789 --> 02:03:44,374
Not long. 6 months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2162
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:45,876
He'll appeal.

2163
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:48,128
I can watch the rest overseas.

2164
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:06,688
Go slowly.

2165
02:04:06,856 --> 02:04:07,856
But I want it.

2166
02:04:28,211 --> 02:04:29,670
Don't rush.

2167
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:31,922
Just do it.

2168
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:41,932
Harder.

2169
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:23,659
You fucking bitch.

2170
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:36,004
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2171
02:06:37,632 --> 02:06:41,009
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2172
02:06:41,177 --> 02:06:42,337
We'll make sure it's a match.

2173
02:06:42,345 --> 02:06:43,971
Yeah, it'll match.

2174
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:46,473
Thank you very much.

2175
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:48,016
What do you think?

2176
02:06:48,184 --> 02:06:49,351
Are we pals again?

2177
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:52,938
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2178
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,106
What do you think?

2179
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:57,025
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2180
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:01,530
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2181
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,490
It's okay. I want to help.

2182
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:04,950
Ms. Dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2183
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:07,327
so we'll keep this very brief.

2184
02:07:07,495 --> 02:07:09,871
Can you walk us through what happened?

2185
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,127
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2186
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:17,879
So normal.

2187
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:19,881
I opened the door.

2188
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:22,342
So strange.

2189
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:26,471
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2190
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,599
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2191
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:31,393
Answer his letters.

2192
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,645
Keep him calm.

2193
02:07:35,064 --> 02:07:36,523
Oh, my God.

2194
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,650
I've encouraged him.

2195
02:07:38,818 --> 02:07:40,610
You can't blame yourself.

2196
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:44,406
He pushed inside.

2197
02:07:45,992 --> 02:07:48,035
And he grabbed me.

2198
02:07:48,745 --> 02:07:51,830
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2199
02:07:52,165 --> 02:07:53,874
And he clubbed me.

2200
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:55,625
I collapsed.

2201
02:07:55,793 --> 02:07:59,713
That club was actually the handle
to a Punch and Judy puppet.

2202
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,298
Right.

2203
02:08:02,216 --> 02:08:03,633
Treasure hunt.

2204
02:08:05,553 --> 02:08:07,471
I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...

2205
02:08:07,638 --> 02:08:09,348
Then how did Desi have that handle?

2206
02:08:11,225 --> 02:08:13,143
I'd just found it.

2207
02:08:13,895 --> 02:08:16,313
It must have fallen off.

2208
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:21,777
I was holding it when Desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2209
02:08:21,944 --> 02:08:23,028
About that woodshed...

2210
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:24,863
He took me to his lake house.

2211
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:27,032
Tied me to his bed.

2212
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,618
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2213
02:08:29,786 --> 02:08:31,495
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2214
02:08:31,662 --> 02:08:33,062
did you notice that it was packed...

2215
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:34,122
Lots of stuff.

2216
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:38,585
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2217
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,128
Nick and credit cards.

2218
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,714
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2219
02:08:42,882 --> 02:08:45,675
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
They're very close.

2220
02:08:46,219 --> 02:08:50,430
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2221
02:08:50,598 --> 02:08:53,225
by a man with a history
of mental problems?

2222
02:08:53,393 --> 02:08:54,473
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

2223
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:00,857
Desi assaulted me that night.

2224
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:03,652
Every night.

2225
02:09:04,779 --> 02:09:07,197
He tied me up like a dog.

2226
02:09:08,574 --> 02:09:11,076
And then, he'd punish me.

2227
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:15,038
Starve me.

2228
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,250
Shave me.

2229
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:21,837
Sodomize me.

2230
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,339
There were cameras everywhere.

2231
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:27,467
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2232
02:09:29,137 --> 02:09:32,347
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2233
02:09:33,433 --> 02:09:35,517
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2234
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:38,270
if he had her tied up the whole time?

2235
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,273
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2236
02:09:42,066 --> 02:09:43,900
Amy, we found your diary.

2237
02:09:44,068 --> 02:09:48,029
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2238
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:51,074
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2239
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:53,410
Nick didn't want a baby.

2240
02:09:55,246 --> 02:09:58,540
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2241
02:09:59,459 --> 02:10:00,459
But I love him.

2242
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:02,377
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2243
02:10:04,338 --> 02:10:06,298
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2244
02:10:06,466 --> 02:10:08,175
If I could just clarify one thing...

2245
02:10:08,342 --> 02:10:11,428
If this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2246
02:10:11,596 --> 02:10:13,472
my husband would be on death row...

2247
02:10:13,764 --> 02:10:17,517
and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2248
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:21,480
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2249
02:10:22,356 --> 02:10:24,399
Now, I have to ask you...

2250
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:27,402
do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2251
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:42,334
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2252
02:10:42,502 --> 02:10:43,752
Amy Dunne is home.

2253
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,879
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2254
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:47,923
but for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2255
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:53,011
and just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2256
02:11:00,478 --> 02:11:02,270
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2257
02:11:54,031 --> 02:11:55,240
We love you, Amy!

2258
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:01,580
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2259
02:12:01,747 --> 02:12:03,415
I'm not pretending.

2260
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:05,834
You were perfect.

2261
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:08,878
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2262
02:12:09,046 --> 02:12:11,646
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2263
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:13,508
That's how well you know me.

2264
02:12:13,676 --> 02:12:16,303
You know me in your marrow.

2265
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:18,763
Okay.

2266
02:12:18,931 --> 02:12:22,267
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2267
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:24,811
Take off your clothes.

2268
02:12:25,313 --> 02:12:28,523
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2269
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:45,707
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2270
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:47,334
I'm a fighter.

2271
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:49,836
I fought my way back to you.

2272
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:51,671
You killed a guy.

2273
02:12:51,881 --> 02:12:53,715
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2274
02:12:53,883 --> 02:12:58,553
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2275
02:12:59,138 --> 02:13:00,263
And I obliged.

2276
02:13:00,431 --> 02:13:01,890
But I want that Nick.

2277
02:13:02,224 --> 02:13:03,516
I'm leaving.

2278
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:06,311
You really think that's smart?

2279
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:07,979
Shampoo.

2280
02:13:10,691 --> 02:13:14,486
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2281
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:16,404
and he deserts her.

2282
02:13:16,572 --> 02:13:17,614
They'll destroy you.

2283
02:13:18,366 --> 02:13:19,741
Neighbors will shun you.

2284
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:24,120
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2285
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:31,294
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2286
02:13:31,879 --> 02:13:33,505
Once they go...

2287
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:35,173
I go.

2288
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:38,760
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2289
02:13:55,611 --> 02:13:57,195
Was there ever a baby?

2290
02:13:57,488 --> 02:13:59,572
There can be.

2291
02:14:03,577 --> 02:14:04,577
Good night.

2292
02:14:57,506 --> 02:14:59,174
Hey, Nick!

2293
02:15:11,312 --> 02:15:12,562
Hello, handsome.

2294
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:17,442
Crepe?

2295
02:15:18,152 --> 02:15:18,943
Sure.

2296
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:20,695
She was his dream girl.

2297
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:24,157
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2298
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:25,700
he took her.

2299
02:15:33,083 --> 02:15:34,417
You must be so proud.

2300
02:15:41,675 --> 02:15:43,676
It's been 4 hours.

2301
02:15:44,178 --> 02:15:47,013
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2302
02:15:51,185 --> 02:15:54,020
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2303
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:58,233
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2304
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,819
that's the real tragedy.

2305
02:16:04,573 --> 02:16:06,616
Kiss my cheek.

2306
02:16:12,957 --> 02:16:15,708
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2307
02:16:15,793 --> 02:16:17,877
She told me she killed Desi.

2308
02:16:18,045 --> 02:16:19,254
Not self-defense. Murder.

2309
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,839
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2310
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:22,048
She told you once before.

2311
02:16:22,216 --> 02:16:24,425
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2312
02:16:24,593 --> 02:16:27,720
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2313
02:16:27,888 --> 02:16:29,347
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2314
02:16:29,598 --> 02:16:31,307
You and Amy under the same roof?

2315
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:33,268
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2316
02:16:33,894 --> 02:16:36,145
Amy Dunne,
and the Miracle on the Mississippi.

2317
02:16:36,313 --> 02:16:38,690
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2318
02:16:38,858 --> 02:16:40,066
We've had our dark days.

2319
02:16:40,234 --> 02:16:42,068
But we thank you so much...

2320
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:47,115
for supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2321
02:16:47,366 --> 02:16:50,952
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2322
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,412
She's good.

2323
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,039
Amazing Amy and the Humbled Husband.

2324
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:57,166
The Real Housewives of Branson.

2325
02:16:57,334 --> 02:16:58,293
Take care of this guy, will you?

2326
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,060
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2327
02:17:00,087 --> 02:17:01,504
You are not at risk anymore.

2328
02:17:01,672 --> 02:17:03,047
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2329
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,260
You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie,
you franchised The Bar.

2330
02:17:07,428 --> 02:17:08,469
You may wanna thank her.

2331
02:17:11,515 --> 02:17:12,932
Just don't piss her off.

2332
02:17:13,767 --> 02:17:14,767
See you, guys.

2333
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:18,438
Elvis has left Missouri.

2334
02:17:18,606 --> 02:17:19,564
She had to have made a mistake.

2335
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:21,900
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2336
02:17:22,067 --> 02:17:23,943
Nick, I can't do anything.

2337
02:17:24,361 --> 02:17:27,071
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2338
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,959
The case is with the Feds now,
they're done.

2339
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:30,033
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2340
02:17:30,451 --> 02:17:32,243
It does.

2341
02:18:03,817 --> 02:18:05,276
What are you doing?

2342
02:18:07,196 --> 02:18:08,655
Couldn't sleep.

2343
02:18:08,822 --> 02:18:09,822
Come on...

2344
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:12,283
let me tuck you back in.

2345
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:27,590
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2346
02:18:29,677 --> 02:18:31,636
Yeah, it's just...

2347
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:33,137
I need more time.

2348
02:18:33,347 --> 02:18:36,891
I would never, ever hurt you.

2349
02:18:38,686 --> 02:18:41,020
I do need you to participate, though.

2350
02:18:41,188 --> 02:18:43,356
I need you to do your part.

2351
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:54,659
Okay.

2352
02:18:55,411 --> 02:18:58,204
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2353
02:18:58,288 --> 02:18:59,539
is a lie.

2354
02:18:59,707 --> 02:19:03,793
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2355
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:05,837
And I have been complicit...

2356
02:19:06,005 --> 02:19:07,130
Nick!

2357
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:14,846
Nick? Breakfast.

2358
02:19:15,014 --> 02:19:16,014
Honey?

2359
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,894
We should hold hands.

2360
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:25,148
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2361
02:19:26,567 --> 02:19:28,776
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2362
02:19:31,405 --> 02:19:33,156
"It's fantastic.

2363
02:19:33,323 --> 02:19:36,242
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2364
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:38,119
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2365
02:19:38,537 --> 02:19:39,537
"Amazing"?

2366
02:19:39,705 --> 02:19:42,415
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2367
02:19:42,583 --> 02:19:45,585
and that you hid all that stuff at Go's
and that you pushed me.

2368
02:19:46,336 --> 02:19:49,380
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2369
02:19:50,591 --> 02:19:52,425
You have to own this, Nick.

2370
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:56,763
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2371
02:19:58,348 --> 02:20:00,099
Nick.

2372
02:20:03,062 --> 02:20:05,688
What a beautiful home.

2373
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:09,484
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2374
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:11,694
You went on national television...

2375
02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:14,197
and told people that I murdered my wife.

2376
02:20:14,364 --> 02:20:15,490
I go where the story goes.

2377
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:18,493
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2378
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,080
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2379
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:26,918
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2380
02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:29,879
Ice-breaker.

2381
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:35,259
To go with your robot dog.

2382
02:20:35,427 --> 02:20:37,470
I'll go find Amy.

2383
02:20:39,515 --> 02:20:41,599
She's downstairs.

2384
02:20:44,103 --> 02:20:45,603
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2385
02:20:45,771 --> 02:20:47,188
Open it.

2386
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:49,107
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2387
02:20:49,274 --> 02:20:50,983
Open it.

2388
02:21:03,539 --> 02:21:05,081
I didn't touch you.

2389
02:21:05,249 --> 02:21:06,249
You didn't need to.

2390
02:21:06,333 --> 02:21:09,418
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2391
02:21:09,586 --> 02:21:10,962
I have that. You threw it out.

2392
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,964
The notice, yes.

2393
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:14,340
I want a blood test.

2394
02:21:14,758 --> 02:21:15,842
I want a paternity test.

2395
02:21:16,635 --> 02:21:17,844
I love tests.

2396
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:19,720
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2397
02:21:19,888 --> 02:21:22,598
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2398
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:27,311
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2399
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,730
He'll do that all by himself.

2400
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:31,774
You fucking cunt!

2401
02:21:33,652 --> 02:21:35,903
I'm the cunt you married.

2402
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:37,738
The only time you liked yourself...

2403
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:41,450
was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2404
02:21:41,618 --> 02:21:45,079
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2405
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:52,086
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2406
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:55,756
You think you would be happy
with a nice Midwestern girl?

2407
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:58,634
No way, baby. I'm it.

2408
02:21:58,802 --> 02:22:02,096
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2409
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:03,764
Why would you even want this?

2410
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:05,141
Yes, I loved you.

2411
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:08,603
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2412
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:09,810
And cause each other pain.

2413
02:22:10,314 --> 02:22:12,106
That's marriage.

2414
02:22:14,776 --> 02:22:17,153
Now, I'm getting ready.

2415
02:22:42,471 --> 02:22:45,431
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2416
02:22:45,599 --> 02:22:47,141
I can't just walk away.

2417
02:22:47,309 --> 02:22:48,768
You could get custody.

2418
02:22:48,936 --> 02:22:52,688
No, I won't. And you know it.

2419
02:22:52,856 --> 02:22:55,358
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2420
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:57,652
You wanna stay.

2421
02:22:57,819 --> 02:23:01,614
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2422
02:23:01,782 --> 02:23:03,032
You wanna stay with her.

2423
02:23:13,669 --> 02:23:14,710
You're breaking my heart.

2424
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:18,673
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2425
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,217
I need you with me on this.

2426
02:23:21,385 --> 02:23:23,844
Of course I'm with you.

2427
02:23:26,473 --> 02:23:30,476
I was with you before we were even born.

2428
02:23:32,229 --> 02:23:35,022
We've been through the darkness.

2429
02:23:35,565 --> 02:23:38,859
We've come out, united.

2430
02:23:41,863 --> 02:23:44,031
We communicate.

2431
02:23:46,326 --> 02:23:48,703
We're honest with each other.

2432
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,371
Right?

2433
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:54,792
We're partners in crime.

2434
02:23:58,171 --> 02:23:59,171
And?

2435
02:24:00,882 --> 02:24:02,216
And?

2436
02:24:05,721 --> 02:24:07,638
We're gonna be parents.

2437
02:24:09,349 --> 02:24:10,975
My goodness!

2438
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:13,352
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2439
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:20,526
"What are you thinking?"

2440
02:24:23,363 --> 02:24:25,573
"How are you feeling?"

2441
02:24:27,534 --> 02:24:30,161
"What have we done to each other?"

2442
02:24:31,747 --> 02:24:33,831
"What will we do?"
