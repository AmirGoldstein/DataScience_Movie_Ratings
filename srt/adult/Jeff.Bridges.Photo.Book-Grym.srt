1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:07,513
Here is a photo book that I made and
gave as a gift to the cast and crew

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,810
when we were <i>making</i>
The Big Lebowski.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:15,142
This is a photo book
made with a Widelux camera,

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,604
which is kind of unique.
It's a panning still camera,

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,240
and it gives you photographs
kind of like this.

6
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,989
There's a lot of information
on there, you know.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,993
That's probably about the
actual frame of the Widelux.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:36,079
One of the things I like about it is
that you see the beautiful actress,

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:41,213
dancer, Viking,
Julianne Moore, here.

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,546
And at the same time, you're able
to see her dancing partners.

11
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,180
Some are taking breaks.
This is the dream sequence.

12
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,516
She's really beautiful there,
I think, don't you?

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,101
I especially like
her bowling balls.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,280
Here's another shot of Julianne

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,325
<i>and the Bowling Pin Chorines,
we called them.</i>

16
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:15,827
Here's a picture of Jack
Kehler, the Dude's landlord.

17
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,333
This is also the... I used this
photograph as the cover of my album

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,667
<i>called Be Here Soon.</i>

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,630
It's available on iTunes.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,471
<i>Here we are at... What the hell
is the name of that restaurant?</i>

21
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:40,936
<i>It's in Santa Monica. It's a wonderful
delicatessen. The Broadway Deli.</i>

22
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,192
And this is my first meeting
with Joel and Ethan,

23
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,694
and there I asked them, "Do you
mind if I take your picture?"

24
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,574
(CHUCKLES) And you can see Joel's there.
He looks a little concerned.

25
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:56,501
<i>But if you look closely, you can see
all the miniature Santa stockings,</i>

26
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,499
it was Christmas time, that
are in the background there.

27
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:06,553
And Jeff Dowd, who was a model that
Joel and Ethan used for the Dude,

28
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,879
he's there, joining us.

29
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,967
Now, here is
our first read-through,

30
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:17,973
<i>and at this time,
you can see a drawing here,</i>

31
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,480
<i>and what it says there is,
"Who is The Big Lebowski?"</i>

32
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,779
Maybe that's a sign that they'd left
on there after they had cast David.

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,571
<i>But there's David Huddleston there.
It was great working with him.</i>

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,532
We'd worked together in a movie
called Bad Company, years before.

35
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,413
<i>Here's a shot of Joel and Ethan</i>

36
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,963
<i>trying to figure out how I'm
not going to break my teeth</i>

37
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,541
<i>when my head is shoved
in the toilet bowl.</i>

38
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,047
I really appreciated
their concern.

39
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,222
There's Ethan in repose,
lounging.

40
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,680
This is our first day
of shooting.

41
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,101
<i>And that was at the car lot,</i>

42
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,685
and the most memorable line
from that scene I remember is,

43
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,815
"Leads, leads!"

44
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,902
<i>There are the two boys. There's Ethan
over there, chewing on an apple.</i>

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,117
Here are the bowlers.

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,167
<i>You can see Jeff "the Dude"
Dowd included in there.</i>

47
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,331
Here's Joel and Ethan on a typical
day in the bowling alley.

48
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:32,969
This is some of the... This is the
team that was bowling against us.

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,636
This fellow here is Jimmie Dale Gilmore.
He plays Smokey back here.

50
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,598
<i>Wonderful country singer. We did
a lot of picking on the movie,</i>

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,603
<i>and it was a lot of fun.</i>

52
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:48,404
Here's the wonderful Sam Elliott,
who played The Stranger.

53
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,237
<i>That's a shot of us together
there in the bowling alley.</i>

54
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,239
<i>It's always wonderful
to work with Sam.</i>

55
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,287
Now, this fellow, Barry Asher, he
was hired to teach us how to bowl.

56
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,791
He's a wonderful bowler, and you never
see the Dude bowling, actually.

57
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:10,418
<i>Here's a shot of John taking some
direction from a bowling ball.</i>

58
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,472
Or maybe it's that fan that you
dry your hands on. I'm not sure.

59
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,686
There's another shot
of John Goodman.

60
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:26,605
<i>Here's a shot of Steve Buscemi
welcoming John Turturro.</i>

61
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,947
<i>This was John's first day
on the set.</i>

62
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,571
Moments after this shot was taken,
he French-kissed the bowling ball,

63
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,822
much to all of our enjoyment.

64
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,120
<i>"Jesus hurls."</i>

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,575
<i>Here's a shot of John
showing his great form.</i>

66
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,917
<i>Here he is talking to Ethan, making a point
about how he's going to play this scene.</i>

67
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,384
Here's my stand-in, Loyd Catlett.
We've done about 50 movies together,

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,977
<i>and this is a shot of us hanging out in
the trailer, picking with Jimmie Dale.</i>

69
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,520
<i>Smokey.</i>

70
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,019
Here are some of the beautiful
women that worked on our show.

71
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:14,027
<i>We're sitting there. You can see
the Ben Hur Auto Repair sign</i>

72
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,734
<i>behind that girl's head.</i>

73
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,114
More guys.
Here's a bowling ball.

74
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:27,663
<i>This is, "Steve picks his ear
while Peter holds his arm,"</i>

75
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>in front of the bowling alley
with those beautiful stars.</i>

76
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,430
Here's a shot of Tara Reid,
who's getting painted.

77
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:46,185
<i>She's the lady who offers
the Dude a blowjob for $1,000,</i>

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:51,273
and he runs off to see
if he can find a cash machine.

79
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,116
<i>Flea, Torsten and Peter prepare to drop
the marmot here with this shot here.</i>

80
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:07,289
There's Ethan and Mark contemplating the
bowling ball that's about to be dropped.

81
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,999
<i>Obviously, he's
never played golf.</i>

82
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,881
Here's stuntmen, Vince Deadrick,

83
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:18,258
who has been my stunt guy in quite a
few movies and Jery Hewitt there.

84
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,179
Here's a shot of Joel and Ethan
lining up a shot with Roger Deakins,

85
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,056
<i>who did such a brilliant job.</i>

86
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,313
<i>This is the scene, I think, where the Dude
meets The Big Lebowski, David Huddleston.</i>

87
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,278
I think probably they're lining
up the shot, here it looks like,

88
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,483
where the Dude is going to look and
see his reflection in that mirror,

89
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:44,037
<i>Time</i> magazine thing, where he looks up
there and sees he's Man of the Year.

90
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,907
<i>Here is Autobahn,</i>

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,463
<i>the shooting of the cover for the
groundbreaking album, Nagelbett.</i>

92
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,048
And here's Ethan lining up
the boys.

93
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,379
A lot goes into making
a movie, you know.

94
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,806
Shooting the album cover for the album
that I'm going to find in Maude's place,

95
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,182
you know, that's some
detailed stuff, man.

96
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,436
<i>Here's The Big Lebowski.
Here's David Huddleston, here,</i>

97
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,144
<i>getting something out of
his pocket, it looks like.</i>

98
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,655
Here's the beautiful Julianne Moore
being made up by Jean Black,

99
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,036
<i>makeup artist.</i>

100
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:30,368
Our first AD, Jeff Rafner,
looks on.

101
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,750
Now, see this painting?
This was in Maude's house.

102
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,082
<i>The brothers gave me
that painting as a gift,</i>

103
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,045
so I have that hanging in my
workout room at home, actually.

104
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,013
Beautiful thing.

105
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,803
<i>Here's another shot
of Loyd Catlett.</i>

106
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,012
<i>My stand-in, he's hanging-in
for me here.</i>

107
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:54,271
<i>This was our 32nd movie
at that time.</i>

108
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,445
<i>This is the scene where I'm flying
through the air in the dream sequence.</i>

109
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,238
<i>I got the bowling ball there.</i>

110
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,558
This is a picture... It's very...
It's a weird picture.

111
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,827
It's not very good,
but I wanted to include it

112
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,576
'cause it would remind me
of the moment.

113
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,081
"Peter Chesney supervises
the fitting of my body cast."

114
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,382
<i>And it was very small. You can see me
in the mirror here, holding the camera.</i>

115
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,175
<i>They made a whole cast
of my body</i>

116
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,879
<i>to support me while
I'm flying through the air.</i>

117
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:28,684
You know, that's how they did that,
so that's me getting this cast made.

118
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,856
<i>Here's Joel in the set
where Arthur Digby Sellers</i>

119
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,025
<i>is in his iron lung.</i>

120
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,604
<i>There he is. Beautiful set
design through the whole movie.</i>

121
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,108
You can see him arranging...

122
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,785
I don't know who this person
is, but they're getting it

123
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,707
<i>so you can see Arthur Digby Sellers in
his iron lung with his mirror there.</i>

124
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,331
<i>I don't know if that's ever in the
movie, if you ever see his face</i>

125
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,291
in the movie or not, but that
was one thought at one point.

126
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:06,051
<i>Here's Daniel Curet painting Ben
Gazzara, who played Jackie Treehorn.</i>

127
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,805
<i>Wonderful job. I loved working
with Ben, always admired his work.</i>

128
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,727
Here's makeup guys, Daniel
and Eddie Henriques here.

129
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,310
<i>They've done
a lot of movies together.</i>

130
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,278
Here John spits Peter's ear
into the sky.

131
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:29,828
<i>This is when Walter bites off this
guy's ear and spits it into the sky.</i>

132
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,749
Here, this shot is,
"Joel and Ethan enjoy

133
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,123
"Peter's ear being reloaded
into John's mouth."

134
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,296
<i>They had to do this scene
several times.</i>

135
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,467
Ben Hur Auto Repair sign
is well-lit in the back.

136
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,638
Very detailed. The Coen
Brothers, one of the things

137
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:53,936
that makes their movies so entertaining, I
think, for me, is their attention to detail.

138
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,856
They're really into
all those little deals.

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,521
<i>Here's a shot of Jon Polito, who
played Da Fino, the private dick.</i>

140
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,493
It says here, "Da Fino is searching for Bunny.
She's been kidnapped."

141
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,992
He's holding up photographs of her
parents' farm in Moorhead, Minnesota,

142
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:19,044
not far away from Fargo, North Dakota,
where my wife, Sue, was raised.

143
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,462
It's not unusual to have a Coen
Brothers film involve kidnapping.

144
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,044
If you notice, a lot of their
films involve kidnapping.

145
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,933
<i>Here's a shot of Jeff "the Dude" Dowd
and me, Jeff "the Dude" Bridges.</i>

146
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,054
<i>"Mr. Dowd was a role model for my
character, Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski.</i>

147
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:42,109
"Here he is, captured on film, visiting
the set, giving us his blessing."

148
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,230
Here's a shot of The Big Lebowski
being hurled to the floor.

149
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,698
<i>Here, on the next page,
Ethan directed as well.</i>

150
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,326
<i>Sometimes people don't think that
Ethan gets in there to direct,</i>

151
00:10:55,405 --> 00:11:01,287
but here he is seen attempting to
experience what Bugsy, Walter's dog,

152
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,667
might be feeling in the scene.

153
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,841
(LAUGHING)

154
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,925
That looks like a set-up thing,
but no, he actually did that.

155
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,974
There's no tongue in any
of the cheeks in this shot.

156
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:19,601
They're all serious men at work. Look
how serious all of the guys are there.

157
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,229
<i>Roger Deakins looks very
serious, slightly impatient,</i>

158
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,437
<i>but he's putting up
with the director's needs.</i>

159
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,697
Here's something
I like to do with this camera.

160
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,320
<i>This is a good example of it.</i>

161
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,027
<i>I have quite a few actors
photographed like this,</i>

162
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,833
<i>in the classic Greek
tragedia/comedia masks.</i>

163
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,292
Here's Philip Seymour Hoffman,
and that's all on one negative.

164
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,250
And because of the nature
of the shutter on my camera,

165
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,760
which actually pans, I can include a
double image like this on one negative.

166
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,971
<i>Here's a shot over here of David Huddleston
doing the same tragedy and comedy.</i>

167
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:05,226
(CHUCKLES) Here's a shot of T-Bone
Burnett looking into his own mouth.

168
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,398
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

169
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,447
<i>T-Bone's an old friend.
I met him on Heaven's Gate,</i>

170
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,274
<i>and we've been friends
ever since,</i>

171
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,985
and it was very exciting
for me to learn

172
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,117
that he was going to be the
music supervisor on Lebowski.

173
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:22,292
And it's a wonderful album, as
those of you who have it know.

174
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,745
Got some great songs
in The Big <i>Lebowski.</i>

175
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,585
<i>Here's another comedy/tragedy of
David Thewlis, the laughing man.</i>

176
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,881
<i>Very good face.</i>

177
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,090
Here's a picture of Jack Kehler.
This is one of my favorite scenes,

178
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,426
is his wonderful
dance performance.

179
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,683
<i>We go to his dance recital,
and here he is discussing</i>

180
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,518
with Bill and Jacqui Landrum his
very emotional performance, it says.

181
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,024
Here's Jack. This is his
very emotional performance.

182
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:58,863
And here we have me, the Dude,

183
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,788
<i>and the girls of my dream.</i>

184
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,540
<i>I somehow worked my way into their dressing
room here and got a picture of that,</i>

185
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,713
putting on their bowling
pin hats.

186
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,547
<i>I scored one of those. I have
a bowling pin hat actually.</i>

187
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,886
My girls enjoy wearing that
on Halloween.

188
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:20,092
There they are now. This is my wife,
Sue, and my daughters, Iz, Hay and Jess.

189
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,681
<i>They visit the set
and don bowling pin hats.</i>

190
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,812
<i>And Mary Zophres here
and Pam, her assistant,</i>

191
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,817
<i>are dressing the Bowling Pin
Chorines, putting their helmets on.</i>

192
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:39,119
Here's Bill and Jacqui, our choreographers.
They're choreographing the dance.

193
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,615
<i>A Busby Berkeley-type bowling
pin flower is executed here.</i>

194
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,369
"Bowling Pin Chorines,
take five."

195
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,001
<i>Those hats were kind of
a pain in the ass, I think.</i>

196
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,956
<i>Now, there they are,
just chilling out.</i>

197
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,336
Here's me and my girls.

198
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,801
<i>God, I look at that picture...</i>

199
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,226
<i>That's the thing about kids, they really
let you know how fast everything goes by.</i>

200
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,474
<i>They're all in
their mid-20s now.</i>

201
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,976
<i>Look at them, they're just
like little girls. My God.</i>

202
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,897
<i>"Andy pulls focus
on Maude and the Chorines."</i>

203
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,823
This shot here, you can see
this guy, he's very dimly lit,

204
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,824
<i>but that's one of the most critical jobs
making movies, is the focus puller.</i>

205
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,702
<i>You could be doing
all kinds of great work,</i>

206
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,285
and the film comes back, and
it's out of focus, it's no good.

207
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,042
So these guys don't get
heralded too much.

208
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,090
<i>Here's a shot that's very
much like the cover.</i>

209
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,009
"Maude as Bowling
Valkyrie Goddess."

210
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,604
And the thing I like
about this photograph,

211
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,222
I don't know if you can
see it here on this side,

212
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,927
<i>both of the sides, you can see
these girls lying down.</i>

213
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,272
<i>Can you see that?</i>

214
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,769
<i>And then you pan on the other side and you
can see them lying down on the other side.</i>

215
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,647
<i>They're taking five while
Julianne's working out her moves.</i>

216
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,821
Julianne Moore,
she's such a beauty.

217
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,904
Here's an interesting shot.

218
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,985
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

219
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,447
<i>And what happened here... I'll just
read the copy of the thing, it says,</i>

220
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,830
"As part of the dream sequence, the
Dude was required to glide between

221
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,038
"the legs of the Bowling Pin
Chorines, and look up their skirts.

222
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,591
"To ease the tension, I asked if I
could take a picture of this event.

223
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,135
"A Chorine winked and said,
'By all means, Dude.'

224
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,928
"Here is the picture right here.

225
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:25,760
<i>"As I looked up, I found each pubic
patch more ornate than the next.</i>

226
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,768
"They had stuffed huge clumps of
crepe hair in their leotards.

227
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,770
"We all had a good laugh."

228
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:39,073
<i>(LAUGHING) This is me
walking to the place.</i>

229
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,031
Here's a shot of Julianne
without her horns on.

230
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,035
Here's Joel demonstrating the
proper way to hold a trident.

231
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:59,293
<i>Here is my manager and dear friend
Neil Koenigsberg, visiting the set.</i>

232
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,176
And in the background, you can
see these disembodied legs here.

233
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,007
This was used for
one of the shots.

234
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,388
<i>This is kind of a bizarre image.</i>

235
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,814
Here we have another shot
of the Bowling Pin Chorines,

236
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,562
<i>resting between shots.</i>

237
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,484
Here, the shot of the brothers.

238
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,033
<i>This was the day where we cast
Denny's ashes to the wind.</i>

239
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,115
Here's another shot
of that spot.

240
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:35,170
And this is a shot of the bowling alley,
with a little tweaking on each edge.

241
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,963
You know, as the camera pans
like this...

242
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:44,050
It's a very forgiving camera. You can hold
it, you can take a shot at 15th of a second,

243
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,303
which is kind of tough
with normal still cameras.

244
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:53,105
And with this particular camera, a
15th of a second is about this long.

245
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,063
So you have that much time to
jack with the image, you know.

246
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,525
So, now, on this image, you can see
I'd moved the camera a little here,

247
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,203
stayed still for this one, and then
moved it a little bit on that side,

248
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,030
<i>and that's how
you get that effect.</i>

249
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:16,245
And that is my photographic
book from The Big Lebowski.
