1
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,042
What?

2
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:28,631
I said I want to tell you my story.

3
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,382
What the hell?

4
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,969
What's with the way
you fucking talk?

5
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:37,807
Who the fuck are you?

6
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:49,986
My name is...

7
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:57,576
Oh Dae-su.

8
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,203
Why did you hit on
someone else's girlfriend?

9
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,748
Hold on.
Did I hit on her?

10
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,459
- Mr. Oh Dae-su!
- Did I hit on her?

11
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,294
Fuck!

12
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:08,253
Okay! I got it.

13
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,631
Just a minute.
Okay! Okay!

14
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,799
Fuck.

15
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,054
Mr. Oh Dae-su
please sit down.

16
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,600
He is totally drunk.

17
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:25,020
I hit on her?
Hey, let me piss first.

18
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,106
I didn't hit on anyone!

19
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,734
- You son of a bitch!
- This guy is a real headache.

20
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,487
- Asshole!
- Mr. Oh Dae-su!

21
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,446
Sit down.

22
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,115
I'm very sorry.

23
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,243
- I gotta piss bad.
- Great.

24
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,580
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

25
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,874
Today is
my daughter's birthday.

26
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,170
I got her
a birthday present.

27
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,173
Snatches of clouds
float in the sky.

28
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,216
Ah, great.

29
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,968
A pleasure boat
floats on the river.

30
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,723
My name
Oh Dae-su, means...

31
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:08,271
..."Just get by the day quietly."
That's why I'm Oh Dae-su.

32
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,941
But, shit...

33
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,407
Why can't I get by this day quietly...
Let me go! Huh!

34
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,828
- Shut the hell up!
- Let me go!

35
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,931
Let go of me!

36
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,433
That guy really needs
some prison time.

37
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:48,563
- Get away from me!
- Hey, get him!

38
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:57,863
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

39
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,782
Have a nice day
Officer.

40
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,869
He's usually a nice guy, but...
Let's go.

41
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,246
I'll come visit you soon.

42
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,957
No need.
Don't come back.

43
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,544
That's up to me
you assholes.

44
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,379
Hey!

45
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:22,929
My sweet pea, it's daddy.
Daddy got you a present.

46
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,391
I'll be home soon with your gift
so wait a bit longer.

47
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,392
Let me talk to her.

48
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,896
- Good girl, good.
- Give me the phone.

49
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,565
Sweet pea, Joo-hwan
wants to talk to you.

50
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,611
You know Joo-hwan, right?
Hold on.

51
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:44,242
Hi, sweetie.
It's me, Joo-hwan.

52
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:49,039
So today's your birthday?
Happy birthday.

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,708
I'll treat you
to something nice tomorrow.

54
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:56,421
Hello?
Oh, Ja-hyun, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:56,422 --> 00:05:00,300
I know it's very late.
Dae-su is on his way now.

56
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,470
I'm sorry.
Yes? Hold on.

57
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:09,018
Dae-su, it's your wife.

58
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,771
Dae-su!

59
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,899
Dae-su!

60
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,655
Oh Dae-su!

61
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,534
Dae-su!

62
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:35,628
I really had enough!
Stop fooling around and let's go already.

63
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,884
Dae-su!

64
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,400
Sir, sir.

65
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,612
Wait, come here.
Come talk to me.

66
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:47,490
I won't ask you to let me go.

67
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:54,497
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?
I should know the reason at least.

68
00:06:54,498 --> 00:07:00,004
Shit, I've been locked up here
for two months already.

69
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,507
Sir, wait, come here.
What is this place?

70
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:09,137
Sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay in here.

71
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,218
Just tell me that, huh?
Sir!

72
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,725
Fuck you!

73
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,646
Come here, you asshole!

74
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,689
Son of a bitch.

75
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,109
I saw your face, asshole.
You're dead when I get out.

76
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,569
Come here, asshole.

77
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,529
I'm sorry. I won't curse.

78
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,660
Just tell me.
One month, two, or three?

79
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,787
Hey, where are you going?

80
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,208
Just tell me how long
you son of a bitch!

81
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,630
I said tell me how long
you asshole!

82
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:49,345
You son of a bitch!
Fucking assholes!

83
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,601
<i>If they had told me
it was going to be 15 years...</i>

84
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,146
<i>...could it have been
easier to endure?</i>

85
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,274

88
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,302
<i>When the gas comes
I fall asleep.</i>

89
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,228

that it's the same Valium gas...</i>

You eat it...

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,148

00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,898
<i>I'll be out.</i>

174
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,653
<i>I 'll be out after a month.
I 'll be out of here.</i>

175
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,324
<i>One month, in just one month
I 'II be out.</i>

176
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,286
<i>I'll need money when I get out
what should I do?</i>

177
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,414
<i>Should I steal or rob?</i>

178
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,376
<i>What shall I eat first?
Kimchi stew, grilled eels?</i>

179
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,213
<i>Anything as long as
it's not fried dumplings.</i>

180
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,131
<i>Where is this place anyway?</i>

181
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,176
<i>I hear noisy traffic
so this must be a city.</i>

182
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,763
<i>But the important thing is
just what floor this is.</i>

183
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,725
<i>What if I break through the wall
and it's the 52nd floor?</i>

184
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,604
<i>Even if! fall to my death
I'm still getting out.</i>

185
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,106
<i>I'm getting out.</i>

186
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,401
<i>In one month, I'm getting out.</i>

187
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,393
Right now
you're lying on a field.

188
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,397
When you hear the bell...

189
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:49,861
...you will turn your head
and look down.

190
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:57,828
You will see
an endless field of green grass.

191
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,335
The sun is shining bright
and there's a gentle breeze.

192
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,061
<i>It's a human being.</i>

193
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,232
Don't stop me!

194
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,275
Mister...

195
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:59,700
...even though
I'm no better than a beast...

196
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:08,291
...don't I have the right to live, no?

197
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,421
Mister...

198
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:20,262
...even though
I'm no better than a beast...

199
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:32,391
...don't I have the right to live, no?

200
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,384
<i>That phone booth alley
was right here.</i>

201
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,888
<i>Now there's
an apartment building.</i>

202
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,392
<i>Still, dumping me on the roof...
he's not the most flexible type.</i>

203
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,521
I want to tell you my story.

204
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,856
Die a little later.

205
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,275
What?

206
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,160
I see.

207
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:36,963
Now, I'll tell you my story.

208
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,638
You see, the reason
why I want to die...

209
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,434
Mister!

210
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,107
<i>It's a woman human being.</i>

211
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,003
That crazy guy took my sunglasses...

212
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:29,349
<i>Laugh, and the world laughs with you.</i>

213
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>Weep, and you weep alone.</i>

214
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,569
<i>My home is gone.</i>

215
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,947
<i>I can't call my friends or relatives...</i>

216
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,826
<i>...because I'm someone
who's murdered his wife.</i>

217
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,498
<i>Because I'm a fugitive.</i>

218
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,044
I swear man.

219
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,131
Nah, he'll kick your ass.

220
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,551
Come on, trust me man.

221
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,900
You fucktard!

222
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,371
<i>Fucktard...</i>

223
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:40,420
<i>Never heard that one before.
TV doesn't teach you curse words.</i>

224
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:54,517
<i>10 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

225
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,780
<i>It is.</i>

226
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:14,787
<i>Striped beakfish.
Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

227
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:18,083
<i>Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.</i>

228
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>Despite its weak reflexes...</i>

229
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,588
<i>...it's known to resist
tenaciously when caught.</i>

230
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,175
<i>In South Kyoung-sang Province
its offspring...</i>

231
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,178
<i>What's this smell?</i>

232
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,527
Don't even think about
asking me any questions.

233
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,571
I don't know a thing.

234
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,631
Pardon?

235
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,097
I said I want to eat something alive.

236
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,186
Oh, right...

237
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,604
Long time no see.

238
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,524
<i>This is my first time.</i>

239
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,734
Maybe not?

240
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,528
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

241
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:35,451
You look very familiar.
Where have we met?

242
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:40,497
"The Search for the Best Chefs"
Channel 11 Thursdays at 6:30

243
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:44,251
The youngest female
Japanese cuisine chef in Korea.

244
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,754
Oh that?

245
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,673
They said the ratings are low
but I guess not.

246
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:53,385
Women's hands are warm
so they can't make sushi.

247
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,306
You sure do know a lot.

248
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,279
Who are you?

249
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:18,036
<i>Do you like your clothes?</i>

250
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,168
Why...

251
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,174
- Why did you lock me up?
- <i>Who do you think I am?</i>

252
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,636
<i>- 'loo Heung-sam'!
- Wrong.</i>

253
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,473
- <i>Did Lee So-young hire you?
- No, Wrong again.</i>

254
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,809
<i>Lee Jung-VOW?</i>

255
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,020
<i>Kang Chang-sum Hwang Joo-yeon'!?</i>

256
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,023
Kim Na-sung'? Park Jin-woo?

257
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,109
Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung?
Kuk Su-ran? Who is it'?

258
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,528
Who the hell are you?

259
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,403
<i>Me?</i>

260
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:58,076
<i>I'm sort of a scholar
ano' my major is you.</i>

261
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,164
<i>An 0h Dae-su-ologist.
An expert on Oh Dae-su.</i>

262
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,543
<i>Who I am isn't important.
The important thing is why.</i>

263
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:11,631
<i>Think it over.
Review your whole life.</i>

264
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,885
<i>School is over, so now
it's time for homework. Right?</i>

265
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,347
<i>Keep this in mind...</i>

266
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:25,687
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

267
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,648
Let me ask you one thing.

268
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:33,111
You hypnotized me in there
didn't you?

269
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,698
What was the hypnotic suggestion?

270
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,702
<i>I miss you.
Hurry and come to me.</i>

271
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,382
Here you are.

272
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:02,974
It's alive, right'?
May I slice it now?

273
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,473
I must be different from other women.
My hands are very cold.

274
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,351
<i>What's with her?</i>

275
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,315
Sir.

276
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:57,819
Hold on.
Hey mister, wake up...

277
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,239
<i>Keep this in mind...</i>

278
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:08,665
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

279
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,381
You're awake?

280
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,060
Is this true?

281
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,250
That fever medicine
really works.

282
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:58,089
You fainted so easy for
someone who exercised so much.

283
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:05,847
Lack of sunlight over a longtime
leads to deficiencies in vitamins A and E.

284
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,935
Hence my lack of immunity
against the influenza.

285
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,731
Do you usually talk that way?

286
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:30,287
The bathroom door is broken
and doesn't lock.

287
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:34,375
Don't get any ideas.
I could slice you like sashimi.

288
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,295
What's this?

289
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,838
Suppositories.

290
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,634
How else could I feed medicine
to someone who's fainted?

291
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:02,153
<i>15 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

292
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,329
<i>It isn't.</i>

293
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,931
I deserve to die for that.

294
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:40,483
I bring you here only to deny you.
I get why you're angry.

295
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,860
I admit it.

296
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:52,245
I brought you here
because I like you too, but...

297
00:31:55,164 --> 00:32:00,086
You don't even know my name.
I'm Mido.

298
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:08,845
You know...
Later, when I feel I'm ready...

299
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,890
Then we do it.
Scouts honor.

300
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:18,520
That song, "The Face I Miss"
in your journal. That's the sign.

301
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:23,151
When I sing it
get yourself ready right away.

302
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:32,951
When it actually comes to
the critical moment, I may resist.

303
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,537
But show no mercy.

304
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,458
Just give it to me!

305
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,173
<i>Give it to you?</i>

306
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,055
The ants...

307
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:58,561
Do they still come out?
Do you still feel them?

308
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:04,566
When it comes to loneliness
it's always the ants.

309
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,569
The real lonely people I met...

310
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,073
...they all hallucinated ants
even if just for a second.

311
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,700
Come to think about it...

312
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,038
You know how ants always
move in groups.

313
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,752
So I suppose the real lonely people
keep imagining ants.

314
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,339
Of course, I never did myself.

315
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:31,319
She called from overseas
five or six years ago.

316
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,114
Asked if her dad showed up.

317
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,910
She didn't even know that
he killed her mother.

318
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:42,873
She must have called us since
she only has few relatives.

319
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,252
She had lost a lot of her Korean.

320
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,215
Her foster parents are
both doctors or something.

321
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:55,720
Anyhow, Miss Reporter...

322
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:03,269
Dae-su is really
not caught yet?

323
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,317
Your daughter's address is on the front.

324
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:13,487
On the back is a map to your wife's grave.

325
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,242
<i>Eva...</i>

326
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,288
<i>Stockholm... Eva...</i>

327
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,291
Do you want to call her?

328
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,841
Want me to call her?

329
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,891
Want to go to
the grave together?

330
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:52,818
<i>No, after I kill that bastard first.</i>

331
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,180
<i>"Blue Dragon"</i>

332
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,891
Is it the one?

333
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,269
<i>I haven't even started chewing.</i>

334
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,731
<i>"Blue Dragon"</i>

335
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,193
$0'?

336
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,114
Was that the same taste?

337
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,879
<i>Be it 10 or 100 restaurants
it doesn't matter.</i>

338
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:59,677
<i>I can't ever forget the taste
I had for 15 years.</i>

339
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,102
<i>"Blue Dragon"</i>

340
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,377
Shall I make you a log-in ID?
Your favorite movie or song?

341
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:40,049
I was talking to him...

342
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:47,349
<i>"Evergreen: Where did you go? Talking to someone?
Princess Sashimi: I was talking to him.“</i>

343
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,353
"The Count of Monte Cristo?"

344
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:58,360
There's no one
by that name here.

345
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:10,371
<i>"How's life in a bigger prison
Mr. Oh Dae-su?"</i>

346
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,832
Who are you?

347
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,963
"Who are you..."

348
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,216
<i>"A lonely prince locked up
in a high tower."</i>

349
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,343
Who is he?

350
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,684
I don't know.
Just someone I chat with sometimes.

351
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,354
And talk about sushi.

352
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:45,074
Where are you going?

353
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,499
Where are you going?

354
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,460
I can't trust you.

355
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,810
<i>"Purple... "</i>

356
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,689
<i>Purple Blue Dragon</i>

357
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:20,734
<i>A dragon that's purple and blue.
What does that mean?</i>

358
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,541
<i>Why order from so far away?</i>

359
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,879
<i>We passed five Chinese places
just on the way here.</i>

360
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,425
<i>Feels like my lungs will explode.</i>

361
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:56,562
Tell your chef to go easy on the scallions
in the fried dumplings.

362
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,439
Sure.

363
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,660
- Set it down and go.
- Okay.

364
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:53,242
We can't do it by ourselves if it's
someone protected by bodyguards.

365
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,204
There are people
who specialize in that.

366
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,040
You'll have to hire them too.

367
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,669
We do it by ourselves
only if they are small fries.

368
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:06,965
But if it's over six months
we'll bring them in for free.

369
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,385
Yes, that's right.

370
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,852
Why did you imprison me, you...

371
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,022
...fucktard.

372
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:31,031
In our 7.5 floor business
we guard client info with our lives.

373
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,177
I'm going to pay you back
for all 15 years of my life.

374
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:56,598
With each one pulled out
you age by one year.

375
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:12,990
Stay still.

376
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,458
Ready to talk?

377
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,397
I don't know...

378
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,275
I didn't see his face...

379
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:52,112
I recorded the call...

380
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,086
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

381
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,136
All AB blood types raise your hands.

382
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,611
Hurry, he lost a lot of blood.

383
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,047
Damn, look at him.
Is he dead?

384
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,686
You little piece of shit...

385
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,947
You piece of shit!

386
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:03,285
- Go, motherfucker!
- Get the fuck out!

387
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:18,842
Fuckface!

388
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,803
You fucked up son of a bitch!

389
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,571
Just kill him
damn asshole.

390
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:49,957
Fucking asshole!

391
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:06,825
<i>Yet another day
I couldn't get by quietly.</i>

392
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:13,040
<i>I've now become a monster.</i>

393
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:20,047
<i>When my vengeance is over
could I return to being the old Dae-su?</i>

394
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:30,097
Mister, are you alright?
Look at all this blood.

395
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:34,019
Mister, what happened to you?

396
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,650
Saewoon Apartments
in Eung-am, building 8.

397
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,195
Please take care of him.

398
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:47,491
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

399
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,285
Well, then...

400
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,288
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

401
00:47:57,084 --> 00:48:00,670
<i>Farewell, Oh Dae-su.</i>

402
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:06,927
<i>Farewell...</i>

403
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>A bastard you hate
but wouldn't want to kill.</i>

404
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,904
<i>A bitch you detest
but want more than to kill.</i>

405
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,824
<i>We'll take care of them.</i>

406
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,536
<i>Don't they go mad
being locked up for so long?</i>

407
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:20,666
<i>If you prefer that he doesn't
we can administer some medication.</i>

408
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,252
<i>There's this one called
“Risperdal Solution"</i>

409
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:28,132
<i>It's known to be a reliable
treatment for schizophrenia.</i>

410
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:31,052
<i>The duration is always the issue.</i>

411
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:35,682
<i>- How long are you thinking of...?
- 15 years.</i>

412
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:41,146
<i>- Too long?
- What did he do wrong...?</i>

413
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,773
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see...</i>

414
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,818
<i>...talks too much.</i>

415
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,530
Go to sleep.

416
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:55,494
It's about time you visited Joo-hwan's
Internet cafe tomorrow.

417
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,214
Sit wherever you'd like.

418
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:10,342
Joo-hwan.

419
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,897
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see...</i>

420
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,441
<i>...talks too much.</i>

421
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,406
Have you heard
this voice before?

422
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:37,202
Do you know anyone who would
hate me this much?

423
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:49,881
I don't know all the 260 names
of your women's husbands.

424
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:01,226
<i>"Mido (Princess Sashimi)"</i>

425
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:07,399
- Who's Mido?
- This girl who cries over nothing.

426
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,862
Joo-hwan.

427
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:20,161
Did I really talk that much?

428
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:29,878
Dae-su, the way I see it
you should look for the perpetrator...

429
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:33,383
...among those who used to be
in your close proximity.

430
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:37,971
<i>"Search for friends: Evergreen"</i>

431
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:43,559
<i>"Over 50 search results."</i>

432

<i>"Evergreen invites you

433

Open quote.

435
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,286
Like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter

436
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,999
Like a bird from
the snare of the fowler

437
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:08,668
Free yourself.

438
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,465
- Close <i>quote.</i>
<i>- Who are you?</i>

439
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:17,260
Who are you, you rotten bastard?

440
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,763
<i>I had decided
while I was locked up.</i>

441
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:23,474
<i>That I wouldn't
trust anyone if I get out.</i>

442
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:26,185
<i>That if! find anyone
to be suspicious...</i>

443
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:29,731
<i>...I would create a secret which
only that person and I will know.</i>

444
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:34,526
The messenger ID, 'Monster'
is a trap that I made to catch you.

445
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:38,198
You bring a complete stranger home.
Who are you?

446
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:49,501
Who is Evergreen?

447
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:01,220
<i>I tracked down that ID, Evergreen
and found out the personal details.</i>

448
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,348
<i>- Ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead</i>

449
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:07,559
<i>The name is Su Dee-ah.
Ever heard that surname, 'Su '.7</i>

450
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,521
- Address?
<i>- It's in Eung-am.</i>

451
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:12,399
<i>Saewoon Apartments
Building 7, unit 407.</i>

452
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:22,117
<i>I'm not doing fine
in this life in a bigger prison.</i>

453
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:42,137
"Evergreen."

454
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,390
"Who are you?"

455
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:51,980
You were going to
say that, right?

456
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:58,485
No, you must find out on your own.
Come on, it's a game.

457
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:02,573
First, who?
Then, why?

458
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:05,033
Once you solve the questions
come see me anytime.

459
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:09,831
I'll mark the answers for you.
You have until July 5th.

460
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,710
Only five days left.

461
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,756
Too short?

462
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:23,428
Do your best. If you pass
I'll kill myself instead of Mido.

463
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,974
That's right, Mido.

464
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:33,855
I'm going to kill every woman
you love until you die.

465
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:39,736
You're notorious for not being
able to protect your women.

466
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:49,871
Wow, you're strong
Mr. Monster.

467
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:53,500
You truly are the monster
of my creation.

468
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:59,672
But this way, you won't
ever find out the "why?"

469
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,050
The question that bugged you
for the last 15 years.

470
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:06,471
You don't care anymore?

471
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:16,022
Take that seat.

472
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:25,865
Ah, the dental torture.

473
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:30,202
You won't get enough time
to torture me.

474
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:34,122
I have a weak heart
so I have this motor inside.

475
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:40,046
When it was put in
do you know what I said to the doctor?

476
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:45,008
Doctor Hopkins...

477
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:50,347
...give me a remote control
that can switch the motor off.

478
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:53,434
Pardon? Why?

479
00:55:55,436 --> 00:56:00,691
Sol can kill myself easily
any time I want.

480
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:03,486
I'll give you a 100 grand more.

481
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,460
Oh, what a conundrum.

482
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,297
You want to kill me right away...

483
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:26,342
...but you won't find out
why you were locked up.

484
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:31,305
You want to torture me but
I say I'll kill myself first.

485
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:36,978
To get your revenge
or to find out the reason.

486
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:42,107
Oh, that is the big question.

487
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:45,361
I've been watching you
for 15 years.

488
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:53,369
I fared well thanks to you.
I wasn't bored or lonely.

489
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:59,626
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for the ones who were hurt.

490
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,502
Try it.

491
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:06,006
The loss of 15 years.

492
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:10,970
The pain of losing your wife and child.
All these would go away.

493
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:16,224
In other words
vengeance is healthy.

494
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:21,856
But what happens after
you've fulfilled your vengeance?

495
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:26,611
I bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again.

496
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,407
"Are you there
Mr. Oh Dae-su?"

497
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:36,996
"Mr. Oh Dae-su
long time no see."

498
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,134
Hasn't she been tied up for too long?
I think you also left the door open.

499
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,024
Please save me.

500
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,444
<i>I need saving myself.</i>

501
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:12,615
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose.

502
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:21,082
This dentist is really good.

503
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:33,469
Don't move.

504
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,805
What's with you?

505
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:45,690
Now...

506
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,317
...here we go.

507
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:12,500
You know, they say that
cowardice comes from imagination.

508
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:18,263
So try not to imagine.

509
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:20,767
It'll make you fucking brave.

510
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:23,978
Now, here comes the real thing.

511
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:54,008
Yes?

512
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:00,139
Well, sir, I do thank you for
telling me about this place...

513
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,684
...but I haven't even started.

514
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:05,644
What?

515
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:20,785
Let's go.

516
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,262
Let's really go.

517
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,180
Let's fight.

518
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:45,643
Let's fight.

519
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,691
Tenacious.

520
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,110
Your hand.

521
01:00:55,111 --> 01:01:00,825
I'm going to cut off your hand.
You touched Mido's breasts.

522
01:01:06,956 --> 01:01:09,292
Then what about my tongue?

523
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:27,852
You still don't trust me
you rotten bastard?

524
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,773
I don't think we'll
reach an agreement.

525
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,233
I looked into it...

526
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:38,570
...and their reason for not paying
more than 270 million...

527
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:41,489
...wasn't to do with
the evaluation of this building.

528
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,951
It's likely that their
convertible bonds holders are...

529
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,789
So I think there won't be a big issue.

530
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:56,339
Of course, there's the 25 percent stake
held by their chairman and his relatives...

531
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:04,889
Dae-su.

532
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,433
Yeah.

533
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,940
Did he really say
that he'll kill me?

534
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:16,901
Yeah.

535
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,446
Because I am
a woman you love?

536
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:27,745
Dae-su.

537
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:30,665
What?

538
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:35,086
I wonder where my love is.

539
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:39,882
The night is getting lonelier.

540
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:47,306
The words we spoke with our eyes...

541
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,185
<i>...can be felt with these hands.</i>

542
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:56,065
<i>Countless nights may pass...</i>

543
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:01,070
<i>...but my heart is turned to you.</i>

544
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:05,950
Though I may shed my sad tears...

545
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:10,997
<i>...it's still your face that I miss.</i>

546
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:20,006
They packed up and left in a rental car.

547
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:26,304
Mido called the restaurant and quit.

548
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,143
Let's go after this is done.

549
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,731
You should get some rest today.

550
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:43,321
I have insomnia anyway.
"The night is getting lonelier."

551
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:48,826
Mr. Han, do you really think...

552
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:53,414
...Mid0 has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

553
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:56,167
Already?

554
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:20,733
Dae-su, it really hurts.

555
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,861
But I'm enduring it.

556
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:26,864
I want you to know that.

557
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,757
How did you hold out?
For 15 years?

558
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,926
There's always a way.

559
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,762
Do you like it?

560
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:56,852
You really like it, right'?
I want to be good to you.

561
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,383
<i>Do not worry about the future.</i>

562
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,011
<i>Don't imagine anything.</i>

563
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:45,901
<i>I feel thankful for
all those years in that prison.</i>

564
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:52,491
<i>If I was still my old self
would Mido have liked me like this?</i>

565
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:33,341
<i>The fact that he knew I wanted to
cut off Park's hand means...</i>

566
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:36,594
<i>...he's planted a bug on us.</i>

567
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,514
<i>He knew where we were by tailing us.</i>

568
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:42,601
<i>"I've been bugged.
Please find it."</i>

569
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:46,312
<i>Maybe, he let you go...</i>

570
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:50,818
<i>...because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.</i>

571
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:56,282
<i>Never telling you why
toying with you forever.</i>

572
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,743
<i>Could that be it?</i>

573
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:04,038
Evergreen Press

574
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,707

<i>"Welcome to Evergreen Old Boys...</i>

<i>...the Sangnok High School

583
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:51,169
<i>But it's time to close up.</i>

584
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,132
Can't I look at the
records of Class '79?

585
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:02,139
It's dark so turn on the lights.

586
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,770
Take your time.

587
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:14,485
Joo-hwan?
Let me ask you something.

588
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:18,696
Do you know
Lee Woo-jin of Class '79?

589
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:20,407
I think he went to
America to study.

590
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,035
<i>Lee Woo-fin?</i>

591
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:29,791
<i>Don't know him. Is that his name?
How did you find out?</i>

592
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:33,127
Looked through all the yearbooks
and found his face.

593
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:35,421
<i>I wouldn't know him
just by his name.</i>

594
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:37,965
<i>"Scissorhands
Hair Salon... "</i>

595
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,718
<i>Got anything else?
Like the school records?</i>

596
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,888
Do you know Lee Soc-ah'?
She was in our year.

597
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:48,976
- <i>Lee Sea-ah? She died.</i>
- What class was she in?

598
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:52,563
<i>Homeroom two.
She was in my class...</i>

599
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:55,818
<i>...next to yours.
What about her?</i>

600
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,321
But why is there...

601
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:06,661
...no photo, because she was dead.
How did Soo-ah die?

602
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:11,959
<i>That's right, you wouldn't know.
She died after you transferred.</i>

603
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:20,376
<i>She went alone to the Habchun Dam
fell into the river, and drowned.</i>

604
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:28,141
<i>A week later they found
her bloated body in the water.</i>

605
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:30,601
- What was she like?
- Her?

606
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:33,730
She was a total slut.

607
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:40,194
Acting like a prude on the outside
but a filthy whore on the inside.

608
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:46,451
There was a huge rumor at the school
that she fucked anyone and everyone.

609
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:49,163
I should've gotten in there.

610
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:58,337
Anyway, her family was super rich.
Her grades were really good, too.

611
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:02,759
But the crucial thing was
that she was such a slut.

612
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,762
This is such an old story.

613
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:09,515
Dae-su, I don't remember too well
since it was so long ago...

614
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:13,479
...but that Soo-ah...
Wait, didn't you also...?

615
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:30,871
<i>Hey, what's going on?
Joo-hwan!</i>

616
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,374
<i>Joo-hwan
what's happening?</i>

617
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,420
<i>Joo-hwan!</i>

618
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,966
Mr. Oh Dae-su?

619
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:50,306
My sister wasn't a slut.

620
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:53,227
I really want you to know that.

621
01:11:55,312 --> 01:12:00,358
Because you got rid of all the bugs
I had to come all the way here.

622
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:02,027
To listen in.

623
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,863
So, Mr. Roh Joo-hwan...

624
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:10,911
...died because of you.
Okay?

625
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:28,011
<i>You son of a bitch!
I'm going to kill you!</i>

626
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,806
<i>I am going to rip you
into little pieces!</i>

627
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,286
Motherfucker!

628
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:16,894
We're not open yet.
Please come back in an hour.

629
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:21,690
A man who got six gold teeth here
recommended this place.

630
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,074
Mr. Park'?

631
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,161
I had to move because of you.

632
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:36,413
To celebrate...

633
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:42,419
...I bought some new TVs.
Do you like it?

634
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,131
There are so many channels.
Exciting, huh?

635
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,592
Some of them even
refuse to leave.

636
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:53,638
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years?

637
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:56,224
Got used to it after 11 years.

638
01:13:57,017 --> 01:14:01,646
Come on, I don't need money.

639
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:04,066
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

640
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,323
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

641
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:14,451
My wife will be happy...

642
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:19,122
<i>Damn sons of bitches</i>
I <i>want to kick</i> their <i>asses.</i>

643
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:27,214
So why did you bring me here?

644
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,758
Let me go!

645
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:34,429
If I don't return after July 5th
then let her go.

646
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:43,521
While I was locked up
I remember someone visiting me.

647
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:47,358
- What did that person do?
- Was it three times?

648
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:52,029
I put hypnosis-inducing
drug in your water.

649
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,615
Sodium Barbiturate?

650
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,368
TV Man knows it all.

651
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:00,122
Dae-su!

652
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:11,675
<i>"Scissorhands
Hair Salon... "</i>

653
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:20,016
That's nonsense.

654
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:22,393
Even though it was a
Catholic school...

655
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:25,771
...doubt she killed herself
because of those rumors.

656
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:28,275
There probably was
another reason.

657
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:33,572
Like she got pregnant
or something.

658
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:38,534
But I don't think Soo-ah
really was a slut.

659
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,953
She was such a
neat and tidy girl.

660
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:44,499
She wouldn't put out
for just anyone.

661
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:49,963
There must have been a guy
she was going out with.

662
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,925
So who was that guy?

663
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,763
Well, I wouldn't know.

664
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:14,945
Choon-shim.
You knew Lee Soo-ah, right?

665
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,948
Who was her boyfriend?

666
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:19,909
Don't know?

667
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,911
Shut the hell up.

668
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:26,040
What would you know
about friendship?

669
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,461
Shut your trap.
Then who'd know?

670
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:33,006
Who?
Joo-hwan?

671
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:37,928
What?

672
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:45,727
Yeah, I know him.
But how would he know?

673
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:50,314
<i>[Yeah'!
Ream]?</i>

674
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:53,318
Okay, hang up.
I'll call you in a bit.

675
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:05,371
Choon-shim says Joo-hwan
had told her about it.

676
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:08,792
And says that
you would know the best.

677
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:27,018
<i>Ring, ring, move aside.</i>

678
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:36,778
<i>You'll get hurt if you hesitate.</i>

679
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:50,167
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

680
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:10,686
Look at you.
Put it out!

681
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,774
I'm transferring today
to Seoul.

682
01:18:16,318 --> 01:18:19,486
So butt out, Miss Kim.

683
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,281
You good-for-nothing...!

684
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:23,968
- You're Oh Dae-su, right?
- And you're Miss...?

685
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,221
I heard you're popular
among the girls.

686
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:30,599
You know how rumors are.

687
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,271
I heard you're really funny.
Say something funny.

688
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,443
Being stuck with one image
isn't healthy, but...

689
01:19:50,412 --> 01:19:55,582
There's this father and son.
They went to the public bath...

690
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,835
See you later.

691
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:24,612
<i>"Take Care
Homeroom Three Fuckheads!"</i>

692
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,048
- Come on.
- Wait.

693
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,886
- Come here.
- No...

694
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:35,475
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay, okay.

695
01:21:44,109 --> 01:21:45,777
Satisfied?

696
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:48,404
- Raise this up.
- No way.

697
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,782
- Raise it.
- No.

698
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,339
What?

699
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,808
It tickles.

700
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,380
Give it here.

701
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:54,094
What are you doing?

702
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:56,806
- Let me see.
- See what?

703
01:22:57,682 --> 01:23:00,143
- Let me see.
- Stop.

704
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,030
Go away.

705
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:57,175
Was it really Soo-ah?
You sure?

706
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,303
I don't know her name.

707
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:04,559
All I know is that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

708
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,318
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul if I go.

709
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,864
- Where are you going?
- Going on a date with Choon-shim.

710
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:21,743
You're dead meat
if you tell anyone!

711
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:27,457
<i>No way.</i>

712
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:33,004
<i>You get locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?</i>

713
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:37,133
<i>Was that such a big sin?</i>

714
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:45,183
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

715
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,605
That's what Lee Woo-jin believes.

716
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:56,486
Then what's special about
July 5th?

717
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:59,155
That's the day...

718
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:04,160
...Lee Soo-ah died.

719
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,209
It's over then.

720
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:17,632
You said it's not about vengeance
but finding out why he locked you up.

721
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,304
Now we'll run away where
he can never find us, right'?

722
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:29,017
I can't end it like this.

723
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:32,271
Vengeance has now
become a part of me.

724
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:40,154
But you don't even know
where he lives.

725
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:44,658
<i>Like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter</i>

726
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:48,245
<i>Like a bird from
the snare of the fowler</i>

727
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:49,872
<i>Free yourself.</i>

728
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:55,877
<i>It's from The Proverbs chapter 6 verse 4.
"Proverbs" is another word for "Maxim".</i>

729
01:26:55,878 --> 01:27:00,757
<i>Ana' Evergreen said
he lives in a high tower.</i>

730
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:05,763
<i>So chapter 6 verse 4
must mean the floor numbers.</i>

731
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:10,727
<i>Fourth floor? Sixth floor?</i>

732
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:13,354
<i>Or the sixty-fourth floor?</i>

733
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:17,358
<i>P?</i>

734
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,235
<i>Penthouse!</i>

735
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,782
<i>Please press the passcode.</i>

736
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,083
What would you like me to pray for?

737
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:40,548
<i>Wrong entry.
Please press again.</i>

738
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:49,806
<i>Wrong entry.
Please press again.</i>

739
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,350
"Dear Lord...

740
01:27:53,186 --> 01:27:58,483
...please let me meet
a younger man next time."

741
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:53,996
Please make Lee Woo-jin
kneel down to Dae-su...

742
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:58,334
...and beg him for mercy.

743
01:29:11,556 --> 01:29:14,267
You slept with your sister.

744
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,571
Let's go up and talk.

745
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:50,678
Sic him!

746
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:16,037
Let's talk it out.

747
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:48,277
Feels great.

748
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,280
You slept with your sister.

749
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:53,616
So refreshing.

750
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:05,670
And I started the rumors.
That's why your sister died.

751
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:17,764
Looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day. Same for you?

752
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:22,853
How unfair of you to erase my memory
and then to tell me to find it.

753
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:25,231
I won, so...

754
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:29,526
...die like you promised.

755
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:35,658
You think you couldn't remember that day
because you were hypnotized? Really?

756
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:40,413
Do you know the real reason
why you couldn't remember?

757
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:44,959
Let me tell you.

758
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,715
You just forgot.

759
01:31:51,549 --> 01:31:54,134
Is that a let down?

760
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:57,721
But it's true
you simply forgot.

761
01:31:57,722 --> 01:32:00,391
Why?
Because it wasn't your business.

762
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:06,564
Your rumor grew to the point where
they were saying Soo-ah got pregnant.

763
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:11,860
My sister got sucked into that rumor
and in the end, began to believe it.

764
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:16,823
Then, her period actually stopped
and her belly began to swell.

765
01:32:16,824 --> 01:32:18,491
Amazing, isn't it'?

766
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:22,454
Ever thought about the girl, pregnant
with a child who's also her nephew?

767
01:32:22,455 --> 01:32:24,081
Understand now?

768
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:29,712
<i>'I our tongue
got my sister pregnant.</i>

769
01:32:31,505 --> 01:32:33,883
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

770
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:37,344
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

771
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:44,393
Is that why you killed your sister?

772
01:32:44,894 --> 01:32:50,483
I thought about the boy, about to
father a child who's also his nephew.

773
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:55,236
You were probably afraid.

774
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:59,158
Afraid that everyone will find out
once the baby's born.

775
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:04,704
When you realized that it was all just
her imagination after you killed her...

776
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,999
...how you must have hated me.

777
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:09,919
It's understandable.

778
01:33:15,049 --> 01:33:20,096
They say Soo-ah died alone at the dam
but who took this photo?

779
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:23,557
What about this date, July 5th?

780
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:34,317
This is no fun.

781
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:40,198
I'll just finish what I was telling you.
Listen carefully. My story is really fun.

782
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:43,118
<i>Ever heard of
post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

783
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,662
<i>You suggest something
during hypnosis...</i>

784
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:48,415
<i>...and then it's acted out
in your awakened state.</i>

785
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,669
Still haven't figured it out?

786
01:33:57,591 --> 01:34:01,262
You bring a complete stranger home
who are you?

787
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:04,098
<i>Who are you, you rotten bastard?</i>

788
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:11,856
<i>We hypnotized you both.</i>

789
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:16,192
<i>One very fortunate thing
was that you both were...</i>

790
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:19,905
<i>...highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to average people.</i>

791
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,574
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

792
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:27,371
<i>One word gets you pregnant
one word gets you in love.</i>

793
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:34,043
<i>But no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis...</i>

794
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:37,505
...or no matter how good
a hypnotist Ms. Yoo is...

795
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:41,552
...getting people to
fall in love isn't easy.

796
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,721
So do you know what we did?

797
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:50,351
- Oh <i>that?</i>
<i>- Your first suggest/on, of course...</i>

798
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:56,274
...was to go to that restaurant
as soon as you were released.

799
01:34:56,275 --> 01:35:00,778
Next, to react to the specific
melody from the cell phone.

800
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:05,451
When you hear the melody
you were to say certain words.

801
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,578
Who are you?

802
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:12,374
Do you like your clothes?

803
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:18,922
<i>To the man who says those words
Mido was to perform a certain action.</i>

804
01:35:18,923 --> 01:35:22,927
<i>When she grabs your hand
your reaction was to be, of course...</i>

805
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:29,642
Your true mistake was not
failing to find the answer.

806
01:35:30,601 --> 01:35:36,314
You kept asking the wrong question
so how could you find the right answer?

807
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:41,361
It's not "Why did Lee Woo-jin lock me up?"

808
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:44,948
It's "Why did he let me go?"

809
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:46,659
Once again...

810
01:35:47,034 --> 01:35:51,664
...why did Lee Woo-jin release
Oh Dae-su after just...

811
01:35:52,957 --> 01:35:54,375
".15 years?

812
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,792
<i>"Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you will weep alone."</i>

813
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:42,019
Mr. Han.

814
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:52,821
Mister Han!

815
01:40:33,195 --> 01:40:34,404
<i>Mme...</i>

816
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,163
Mido doesn't know, right?

817
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,254
Why did you hide her there?

818
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:55,758
You thought he'd hate me
because I cut off his hand?

819
01:40:55,759 --> 01:40:59,555
Didn't you stop to think
maybe it was a trap?

820
01:41:00,264 --> 01:41:04,309
How can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours?

821
01:41:05,102 --> 01:41:10,189
I've been secretly protecting Mido
since she was three.

822
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:12,776
But what about you?

823
01:41:13,402 --> 01:41:15,404
Mr. Park's hand?

824
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:18,448
You imbecile.

825
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,493
Know that new prison of his?
He said he had to move.

826
01:41:22,494 --> 01:41:26,123
So I gave him that building
in payment for his hand!

827
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,148
Dae-su!

828
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:57,194
There's a box here.

829
01:41:57,195 --> 01:42:01,741
It's that same violet box.
He's telling me to open it.

830
01:42:01,742 --> 01:42:02,826
No!

831
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:06,370
No, Mido, don't.

832
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,706
Don't open it no matter what.

833
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:11,083
If you open it
something terrible will happen.

834
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:14,837
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

835
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:17,840
Mido. My sweet pea
wait a bit longer.

836
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:23,138
I'll be there very soon.

837
01:42:24,848 --> 01:42:31,103
Can't you come right now?
I'm scared.

838
01:42:31,104 --> 01:42:33,147
My sweet pea
you can wait for me?

839
01:42:33,148 --> 01:42:34,149
Yes.

840
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:38,611
Good.
Good girl.

841
01:42:38,612 --> 01:42:43,033
I'll call you very soon, okay?

842
01:42:57,506 --> 01:42:58,965
I beg you.

843
01:43:02,094 --> 01:43:04,388
Please don't tell Mido.

844
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:10,519
What has she done wrong?

845
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:16,024
You know it was all my fault.

846
01:43:18,193 --> 01:43:19,653
I have...

847
01:43:21,405 --> 01:43:26,660
I have committed a terrible sin
to your sister.

848
01:43:28,245 --> 01:43:33,625
And I was very wrong to you.

849
01:43:34,835 --> 01:43:40,674
So please leave Mido alone, okay?

850
01:43:45,512 --> 01:43:51,392
If Mido finds out the truth...

851
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:53,728
...you asshole...

852
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:58,274
...from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes...

853
01:43:58,275 --> 01:44:04,363
...no one will be able to find any trace of
your body on this earth. Why?

854
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:07,826
Because I'm going to
chew up every last piece of it.

855
01:44:09,661 --> 01:44:10,829
WOO-jin!

856
01:44:11,788 --> 01:44:14,331
Mr. Lee Woo-jin
I made a mistake.

857
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:17,418
Please forget what I said.

858
01:44:17,419 --> 01:44:19,379
Sir! Boss!

859
01:44:19,838 --> 01:44:21,338
WOO-jin!

860
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:25,552
We're Evergreen Old Boys
remember?

861
01:44:26,303 --> 01:44:32,976
With the energy
from the green pine tree...

862
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:39,983
...the Great Sangnok High...

863
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:46,071
I'll do whatever you want.

864
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:48,991
I'll do anything.
I beg you.

865
01:44:48,992 --> 01:44:54,413
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be a dog, I will!

866
01:44:54,414 --> 01:44:58,083
I'm Woo-jin's dog from now on!

867
01:44:58,084 --> 01:44:59,920
I'm your puppy!

868
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:08,803
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

869
01:45:08,804 --> 01:45:10,346
I'm a dog.

870
01:45:10,347 --> 01:45:14,392
I'll guard your house.
I'll be your slave dog.

871
01:47:22,312 --> 01:47:23,647
The box...

872
01:47:29,527 --> 01:47:31,154
Just leave it closed.

873
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,291
Now...

874
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:48,463
...what joy will I live for'?

875
01:48:52,736 --> 01:48:54,029
<i>Dae-su.</i>

876
01:48:54,946 --> 01:48:56,531
<i>It really hurts.</i>

877
01:48:58,074 --> 01:48:59,868
<i>But I'm enduring it.</i>

878
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:02,912
<i>I want you to know that.</i>

879
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:21,181
<i>How did you hold out?
For 15 years?</i>

880
01:49:23,725 --> 01:49:28,229
My sister and I knew everything
but still loved each other.

881
01:49:31,316 --> 01:49:34,027
Can you two do the same?

882
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:39,031
<i>Dae-su.
Do you like it?</i>

883
01:49:39,032 --> 01:49:41,659
<i>I want to be good to you.</i>

884
01:50:16,694 --> 01:50:17,904
<i>Sou-ah.</i>

885
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:34,629
<i>Woo-Km.</i>

886
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:38,716
I know you've been scared.

887
01:50:41,302 --> 01:50:46,474
So let go of me, okay?

888
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:04,826
Remember me, alright?

889
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,545
I have no regrets.
Do you?

890
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:04,760
<i>Up until this point is
the whole story of my adventure.</i>

891
01:52:04,761 --> 01:52:08,389
<i>Thank you for listening to
this terrible story to the end.</i>

892
01:52:08,973 --> 01:52:13,018
<i>I hope you now understand
my sending a letter...</i>

893
01:52:13,019 --> 01:52:19,441
<i>...instead of talking to you in person.
This is because I have no tongue.</i>

894
01:52:19,442 --> 01:52:23,154
To be honest
I have no reason to help you.

895
01:52:27,867 --> 01:52:29,827
But you see...

896
01:52:30,745 --> 01:52:33,831
I was touched
by this last sentence.

897
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:39,544
<i>"Even though I'm no better than a beast...</i>

898
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:44,467
<i>...d0n 't I have the right to live?"</i>

899
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:50,723
But the hypnosis may go wrong
and mess up your memories.

900
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:53,726
Will that be okay?

901
01:53:14,706 --> 01:53:16,249
Once you're ready...

902
01:53:18,334 --> 01:53:20,837
...stare at that tree.

903
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:42,942
The tree is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

904
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:55,371
<i>You 're now inside Lee Woo-fin's penthouse.</i>

905
01:53:56,331 --> 01:53:58,166
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

906
01:54:01,252 --> 01:54:06,090
<i>The sound of your footsteps to the window
echo through the room.</i>

907
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:24,150
<i>When I ring my bell...</i>

908
01:54:25,151 --> 01:54:28,363
<i>...you'll be split
into two persons.</i>

909
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:36,329
<i>The one who doesn't know the secret
is named, "Oh Dae-su."</i>

910
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:40,583
<i>The one who keeps the secret
is named, "The Monster."</i>

911
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:43,126
<i>When I ring my bell again...</i>

912
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:46,547
<i>...the Monster will turn around
and begin walking.</i>

913
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:56,098
<i>With each step
he will age by one year.</i>

914
01:54:56,099 --> 01:55:00,603
<i>When the Monster reaches seventy
he will die.</i>

915
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:06,484
<i>There's no need to worry.
It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

916
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:15,243
<i>Good luck.</i>

917
01:55:58,035 --> 01:56:00,121
What's wrong?

918
01:56:00,955 --> 01:56:03,040
Look at you.

919
01:56:32,153 --> 01:56:34,071
Who were you with?

920
01:57:30,002 --> 01:57:32,504
I love you...

921
01:57:32,505 --> 01:57:34,298
...Dae-su.
