1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,472
The Big <i>Lebowski</i>
has grown in ten years.

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:10,178
People have seen this film more
than any film that I've been in.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,514
They've written books.
There's the Lebowski Fest.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,521
People are obsessed with that movie.
They're obsessed with it.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,274
What the hell is it?
What attracts people to it?

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,230
It hits something
in the young people.

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,826
Let's roll, please.
Rolling.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,320
Mark.
Action.

9
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,445
It's gigantic.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,336
This movie was released
after Fargo.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,090
And, you know,
Fargo was very successful.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:47,423
<i>And I think the critics didn't know what
to make of this when it was released.</i>

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,885
I remember when it came out,
everybody was like, "So what?"

14
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,562
There was sort of, like,
a little bit of a thunk.

15
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,187
And I loved it. I can remember going
to the premiere here in New York

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,564
and I was like,
"That was so funny."

17
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,318
People didn't seem to
think it was that funny.

18
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,277
It's taken me many years
to actually get the film.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,987
I mean, I liked it,
but then I liked it more.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,370
And it wasn't until the fourth time,
I think I saw it with my son...

21
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,577
You might want to watch
out that front window, Larry.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,162
...that I realized
how hilarious the film is.

23
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:22,425
Son, this is what happens when
you fuck a stranger in the ass!

24
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:29,348
And over the years, I think it's kind of
gotten the attention that it deserves.

25
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,223
<i>JEFF BRIDGES: I rarely will
watch a movie of mine on TV,</i>

26
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,100
<i>but Lebowski,
when that comes on,</i>

27
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,227
it'll hook me, you know,
because there are so many

28
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,400
little flavorful parts about it.

29
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,695
That rug really tied the room
together, did it not?

30
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:48,944
It's a great film to discover. There's a lot
of support out there for those discoverers,

31
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,327
for those little urban achievers or
whatever you want to call yourselves.

32
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:57,376
<i>MOORE: I always say that it's sort of a
Rorschach test, what movies people remember.</i>

33
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,295
When you walk down the street and
somebody says, "Hey I loved you in..."

34
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,295
And I first noticed it
happening with college guys.

35
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,469
And it's sort of
the frat boy kind of thing.

36
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:12,095
When a young man came by, who was 21,
22, it was always The <i>Big</i> Lebowski.

37
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:17,813
...without batting an eye, a man will refer
to his dick, or his rod or his Johnson.

38
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,358
What they say, they either point
at me and scream "Roseanne!"

39
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:26,360
Or call me Tom Arnold, or they'll
whip out a line from <i>Lebowski.</i>

40
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,111
The lines are very whippable.

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,989
Smokey, my friend, you're
entering a world of pain.

42
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,742
Every time John says,
"Shut the fuck up, Donny."

43
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,619
You know, I just love that.

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,290
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

45
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,166
"Shut the fuck up, Donny."
That's a big one.

46
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,747
Donny, you're out
of your element.

47
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,879
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

48
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,386
One of my favorite images
in the film is

49
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,214
when John Turturro
was cleaning his bowling ball.

50
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,767
<i>It's semi-obscene,
and I don't even know why.</i>

51
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,237
<i>TURTURRO: I get mail from
all kinds of people,</i>

52
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,310
and I get all kinds of weird
sex mail from women and men.

53
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,142
This is it!
Let's take that hill!

54
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,525
"Dude, slow it down, when we
hit 15 mph, I'm rolling out."

55
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:12,110
And he has an Uzi wrapped up in paper,
which, naturally, destroys the car.

56
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,579
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

57
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,533
DUDE: Let me just praise my own work.
I love, "I got a beverage here."

58
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,209
You know, I get stuck
into the limo there,

59
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,880
and when I'm trying to describe the new
shit that's come to light, you know?

60
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:29,882
I mean, it's not just... It might not
be just such a simple... You know?

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,214
I tried to be
very faithful to the script.

62
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,268
I didn't want to add any extra
"man's" or any extra "fuck's,"

63
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,392
or even the ellipses that the
guys put in there, you know?

64
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,691
I wanted to put the pauses
where those were.

65
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:51,069
<i>MOORE: In the Coen brothers movie, the
language is always so wonderful, so rich.</i>

66
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,152
<i>Their language is so specific that
you would do something and then</i>

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,579
Ethan and Joel will say, "Okay, now do it
again, but leave out these two words."

68
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,874
So you just kind of change... The cadence
of the sentence would be changed.

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,667
They did a great job in creating
the rhythm of the dialog.

70
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,420
Saturday, Donny, is shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

71
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,344
That means I don't work, I don't drive
a car, I don't fucking ride in a car,

72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,342
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven

73
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,515
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

74
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,891
It's very, kind of, old movie style. People
have to rattle off all this exposition

75
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,815
and do it quickly and with a
certain amount of humor and style.

76
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,109
<i>GOODMAN: We got that, I think,
during the rehearsal.</i>

77
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,902
<i>We just got used to
each other's rhythms.</i>

78
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,107
We all know who is at fault here, so
what the fuck are you talking about?

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,034
People always ask me
if it was improvised.

80
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,291
No. God, no. But it was the pauses,
there's, you know, line dot dot dot.

81
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,337
And so, sometimes to discover
the truth of the scene,

82
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:51,463
we would improvise during rehearsal, to
figure out, put it in your own words.

83
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,047
But I tried to always
go back to the script.

84
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,224
MAN: Six Baker. Take two, mark.
And action.

85
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,850
<i>BRIDGES: To have a mind behind your character,
like Joel and Ethan, it's a wonderful gift.</i>

86
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:08,776
I have a brother, who I love very much.
We had a good time working together.

87
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,402
But to imagine directing a film with
Beau, my brother, would be very tough.

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,865
Because, you know,
we have very strong opinions,

89
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,572
and we approach things
in slightly different ways.

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,578
<i>And I asked Joel,
"How do you guys do it?"</i>

91
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,786
He says, in the writing of it,
they've been working on this,

92
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:31,089
and they've honed and they've had
all their discussions and arguments

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,464
<i>if they had any, you know, that kind
of thing to work it all out prior.</i>

94
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:39,049
So when they came to the directing
part, it was all pretty much in place.

95
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,931
And they were just kind of open to see
what else anybody else had to say.

96
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:48,854
They know who they wanna work with.
They know exactly what they wanna do.

97
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:54,280
And it makes for
a very wonderful atmosphere.

98
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,916
<i>MOORE: I think that was the thing
that I found really amazing.</i>

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,195
They seem to be in complete
harmony, in accord, always.

100
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,533
And sometimes Joel would talk to you,
and sometimes Ethan would talk to you.

101
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,040
And I thought, well, they'll come up
together, there will be some discussion.

102
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,373
But it just doesn't work that way. One
will talk and then the other will talk

103
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,005
and they seemed to be
on the same page.

104
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,554
<i>BRIDGES: The big disagreement that
I can remember between the two</i>

105
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,635
was in the dream sequence when my head
is about to hit the bowling balls.

106
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:31,350
Joel, who would kind of be the
point man, as far as directing...

107
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,231
<i>He would usually be the guy
who would...</i>

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,563
<i>Although Ethan would be
kind of flitting around,</i>

109
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,068
and he would add
his thoughts as well.

110
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,528
But Joel said, "Now, when
you hit the bowling balls,

111
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,241
"you're kind of grimacing when
you hit the bowling balls."

112
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,998
And Ethan came up and he said,
"Grimacing, really?

113
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,921
"I thought he'd be smiling.
He would kind of enjoy it."

114
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:57,126
Joel said, "No, I think..."
Ethan said, "Really? Well."

115
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,978
And Ethan kind of looked,
and then there was...

116
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,551
"Well, let's shoot it
both ways. Okay."

117
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,426
And that's basically the biggest
disagreement they'd ever had.

118
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,099
<i>TURTURRO: it's actually interesting
the way they do things.</i>

119
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,228
<i>'Cause it's a Mom and Pop candy store.
One-stop shopping.</i>

120
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,770
And they're involved with every
little thing, and everything counts.

121
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,448
<i>MOORE: Their specificity
of vision, the way they shoot,</i>

122
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,026
<i>the way the production design
is, the script...</i>

123
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,531
Three pigs in blanket.

124
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
...their shots,
everything is so deliberate.

125
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,666
<i>GOODMAN: They're very specific about
things they talk about, like an iron lung</i>

126
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,618
<i>or a Ziploc bag
with somebody's homework.</i>

127
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,922
These things are
almost iconic now,

128
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,627
<i>but they're just very simple things
just put in very strange ways.</i>

129
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,713
In an odd sort of way, you're
just incredibly relaxed,

130
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,049
<i>because everything is
taken care of all the time.</i>

131
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,182
<i>BRIDGES: On the set, the environment
that they created was so loose,</i>

132
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,355
that you felt like you had
all the time in the world.

133
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,509
You could try it this way,
you could try it that way.

134
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,231
They were always very inclusive,
wanted to know, you know,

135
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,107
"You got any ideas?
What do you wanna do?"

136
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,440
<i>BUSCEMI: I think just two
very down-to-earth guys,</i>

137
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:07,747
and they love what they do,
and I love to work with them.

138
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:13,665
Working with those guys
is a joy. It's a joy.

139
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,168
<i>BRIDGES: When I watch The Big Lebowski, I
love the story and all the characters,</i>

140
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,006
but for me, it's very hard to
separate it from my own life.

141
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,888
There's a bit of a home movie
aspect to it even when I watch it,

142
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,720
<i>'cause I remember what
we had for lunch that day,</i>

143
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,601
<i>or what the other takes were.</i>

144
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,933
<i>BUSCEMI: The whole movie
was just easy to do.</i>

145
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,021
I don't remember there being anything hard about it.
We just had a great time.

146
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,320
Donny, please.

147
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,194
It was a once
in a lifetime deal.

148
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,867
Characters like Walter
don't come along every day.

149
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,867
I've seen a lot of spinals,
Dude, and this guy's a fake.

150
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,123
If this is what I'll be remembered
for, then that's aces with me.

151
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,382
I think it's just wonderful.
It's one of my favorite movies.

152
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,385
Not only the movies I've been in, but
just flat out one of my favorite movies.

153
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,151
TURTURRO: College kids are not going to
classes because of The <i>Big</i> Lebowski.

154
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,052
And I blame this all
on Joel and Ethan.

155
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,264
I think they're recognizing it for what it is.
It's a brilliant film.

156
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:19,853
And that's why our society is in crisis.
'Cause of The Big Lebowski.

157
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,896
You don't need the marijuana
to watch the movie, kids.

158
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,073
It's good without it.

159
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,492
<i>TURTURRO: The Dude.
What kind of example is he?</i>

160
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,240
The Dude abides.

161
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,072
It goes on forever.
This stuff could never end.

162
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,475
Who knows what happened
to Walter?

163
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,611
He could have become a priest
or something like that.

164
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,666
Maybe there'll be
a Lebowski Junior.

165
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,497
'Cause he's 10 years old now.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,380
I wonder where that dude is today, must
be about 10 years old now, you know.

167
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,461
I wonder what he's doing.

168
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,140
Probably selling pot to
all his friends. I don't know.
