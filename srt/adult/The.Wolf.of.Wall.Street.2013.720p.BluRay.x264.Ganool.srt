- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, I'm all right.

61

Till next time.

63
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,151
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

64
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:04,725
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

65
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,600
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

66
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,495
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times
a day for my "back pain,"

00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,394
Adderall to stay focused,

68
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:15,375
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

69
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:18,446
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

70
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:19,985
because it's awesome.

71
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,107
Good morning, Nathan.

72
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,450
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

73
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,794
there is one that is
my absolute favorite.

74
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,087
You see,

75
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,291
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

76
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:41,401
Able to conquer the world,

77
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:43,129
and eviscerate your enemies.

78
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,298
Ah!

79
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,559
And I'm not talking about this.

80
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:50,728
I'm talking about this.

81
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,666
<i>See, money doesn't just
buy you a better life,</i>

82
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,211
<i>better food, better
cars, better pussy.</i>

83
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,588
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

84
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,381
<i>You can give generously
to the church</i>

85
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:05,300
<i>or political party of your choice.</i>

86
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,950
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

87
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,495
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

88
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,979
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

89
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,503
<i>and already a
money-crazed little shit.</i>

90
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,775
<i>So what do I do?</i>

91
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,276
<i>I go to the one place on Earth</i>

92
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,675
<i>that befit my
high-minded ambitions.</i>

93
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:28,966
I love you.

94
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:42,480
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

95
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,487
You got a problem with that,

96
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,276
Jordan?

97
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,578
No. No problem at all.

98
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:51,179
Good. Because that is what you are.

99
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,497
Pond scum.

100
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:54,140
Your job is connector,

101
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:58,019
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

102
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,981
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

103
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:03,024
And until you pass your Series 7,

104
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,318
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

105
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,545
Sit!

106
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:11,116
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

107
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:14,471
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

108
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,454
<i>A million dollars?</i>

109
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:19,058
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

110
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,274
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,234
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

112
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,858
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

113
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,633
Smile and dial.

114
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,112
And don't pick up your
fucking head until 1:00.

115
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,721
Hey, fuck him.

116
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,450
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,917
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

118
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,625
Now did you really pitch a stock
in your job interview?

119
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,582
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, sir?

120
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,085
I fucking love that.

121
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,636
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,614
We don't start dialing at 9:30

123
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,533
because our clients are
already answering the phone.

124
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,161
Three. Two. One.

125
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,263
Let's fuck!

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,999
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,043
<i>Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.</i>

128
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,586
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

129
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:06,087
<i>"Cunt, " "cock," "asshole. ".</i>

130
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,381
<i>I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.</i>

131
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:09,758
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

132
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,532
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

133
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,614
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

134
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where
the stock's at today, huh?

135
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,786
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

136
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,372
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

137
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:27,209
You are such a fucking
douchebag, Hanna.

138
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:30,195
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

139
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,924
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

140
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,301
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

141
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:37,803
Done!

142
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,205
Time to paint the tape. Whoo!

143
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,685
2,000. Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

144
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:45,193
Come on.

145
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:48,985
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

146
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,716
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.

147
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:52,989
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

148
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,202
Sold!

149
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,677
Yeah.

150
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,098
Tootski?

151
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,191
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

152
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,194
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

153
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,655
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

154
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,257
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

155
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,009
You know howl like them.
Straight up.

156
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,720
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

157
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,179
you're gonna bring us two more.

158
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,516
Then two more after that
every five minutes

159
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:43,711
until one of us
passes the fuck out.

160
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:46,379
Excellent strategy, sir.

161
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:48,257
I'm good with water for now.

162
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,716
Thank you.

163
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,712
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

164
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,514
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:57,807
Mr. Hanna?

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,994
You're able to do
drugs during the day

167
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,518
and then still function,
still do your job?

168
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:05,957
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

169
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,901
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

170
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,691
Right.

171
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,797
Well, I got to say,
I'm incredibly excited

172
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:15,071
to be a part of your firm.
I mean...

173
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,677
The clients you have
are absolutely...

174
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,075
Fuck the clients.

175
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:22,913
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

176
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,123
You got a girlfriend?

177
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,811
I'm married. I have a wife.

178
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:28,960
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

179
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,356
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,800
Think about Teresa.

181
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,068
Name of the game.

182
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:36,924
Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket.

183
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,114
Right.

184
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,866
But if you make your clients money
at the same time,

185
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,265
it's advantageous to
everyone. Correct?

186
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,062
No.

187
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,891
Number one rule of Wall Street.

188
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,064
Nobody...

189
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,461
I don't care if you're Warren
Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

190
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:54,172
Nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up,

191
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,174
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

192
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,343
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,887
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

194
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:03,036
Uh. Fugayzi. It's a fake.

195
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,892
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy,
it's a woozy, it's...

196
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,353
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

197
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,355
It's never landed. It is no matter.

198
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:11,815
It's not on the elemental chart.

199
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,900
It's not fucking real.

200
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:15,298
- Right?
- Right.

201
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,258
- Stay with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

202
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:20,015
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

203
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,116
No.

204
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:24,160
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

205
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,684
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

206
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,123
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

207
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,874
take his fucking
money and run home.

208
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,898
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

209
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,862
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

210
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,213
No. What do you do?

211
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,066
You get another brilliant idea.

212
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:38,758
A special idea.

213
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,261
Another "situation." Another stock

214
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:43,388
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

215
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,708
And he will, every single time.

216
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,747
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

217
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,854
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

218
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:53,815
Meanwhile,
he thinks he's getting shit rich,

219
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:55,793
which he is, on paper.

220
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,735
But you and me, the brokers,

221
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:59,612
we're taking home cold hard cash

222
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,966
via commission, motherfucker.

223
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:03,641
Right.

224
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:06,911
That's incredible, sir.

225
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,389
I can't tell you how excited I am.

226
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,686
You should be.

227
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:13,562
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

228
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,020
First of all...

229
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:19,108
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,825
Do you jerk off?

231
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,803
Do I... Do I jerk off?

232
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:26,123
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

233
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,537
How many times a week?

234
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,435
Like, um, three or four.

235
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,769
Three or four times, maybe five.

236
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,812
Gotta pump those numbers up.

237
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:35,148
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

238
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,049
I myself, I jerk off
at least twice a day.

239
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:40,778
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

240
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,223
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

241
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,842
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,512
I want to. That's not why I do it.

243
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:49,851
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

244
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,457
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

245
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,501
All day long,
decimal points, high frequencies.

246
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:56,603
Bang, bang, bang.

247
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,148
Fucking digits.

248
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,425
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

249
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:03,778
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">It kind of wigs some people out.</font>

251
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,262
- <font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.
- Right.</font>

252
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:07,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.</font>

253
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

254
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,516
I keep<font color="#FFFFFF"> the rhythm below</font> the belt.

255
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.</font>

256
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,394
This is not a tip, this
is a <font color="#FFFFFF">prescription.</font>

257
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:14,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Trust me.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

258
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't, you will
fall out of balance,</font>

259
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,442
split <font color="#FFFFFF">your differential
and tip the fuck over.</font>

260
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or worse yet,</font>

261
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,637
I've seen this happen, implode.

262
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,739
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

263
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,949
No. No, you don't.

264
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,242
I'm in it for the
long run, you know?

265
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,845
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:31,162
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

267
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:32,247
When you get really good at it,

268
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:35,272
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

269
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,630
Second key to success
in this racket

270
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:41,965
is this little baby right here.

271
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,443
It's called cocaine.

272
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:44,926
Right.

273
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,886
It'll keep you sharp
between the ears.

274
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,955
It'll also help your
fingers dial faster.

275
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,199
And guess what?

276
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,118
That's good for me.

277
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:53,623
Yes, sir.

278
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,167
Revolutions. You follow?

279
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:57,289
Revolutions.

280
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,565
Keep the clients on
the Ferris wheel.

281
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:03,194
And it goes. The park
is open 24/7, 365,

282
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:06,219
every decade, every
goddamn century.

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,637
That's it.

284
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,514
The name of the game.

285
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,142
Halkidiki?

286
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:13,848
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

287
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:26,652
Come on.

288
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,537
We're the common denominator.

289
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,671
Ah.

290
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,008
Ah.

291
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:43,961
Keep it up for me.

00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:02,670
<i>I got to know the ins and outs
of Wall Street.</i>

300
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:06,366
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

301
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,204
Oh!

302
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,365
Oh, fuckers.

303
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,710
Oh!

304
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,442
<i>Then I was a licensed
broker at last,</i>

305
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,527
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

306
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:31,225
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

307
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,817
I have Exxon at 86
1/4 six months ago.

308
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,252
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

309
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,525
Mr...

310
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,885
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

311
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,178
<i>No shit.</i>

312
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,307
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

313
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:59,252
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

314
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,728
I know your family,
you know mine.

315
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,815
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

316
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,233
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

317
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,567
Our market's solid.

318
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:08,295
This is not something
that you want to sell.

319
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,093
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

320
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,239
I think you're making
a big mistake.

321
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,824
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

322
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,534
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

323
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,952
A lot of people are
gonna be calling you,

324
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:17,145
trying to get your dirty laundry.

325
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:18,413
We don't know what's going on here.

326
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:19,766
I know. I know.

327
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,194
Holy

328
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,114
fucking shit!

329
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,516
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

330
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,060
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

331
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:43,521
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

332
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:48,378
<i>an institution since
1899, closed its doors.</i>

333
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,862
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

334
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:53,341
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

335
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,995
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

336
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,580
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

337
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:01,747
If we needed to, I'm saying...

338
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,374
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

339
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,603
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

340
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,044
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

341
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:08,245
You're gonna be a millionaire.

342
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,733
That's right. Okay?
Just let me look.

343
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,030
We'll find something.

344
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:13,759
- How about this?
- What?

345
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,304
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

346
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:17,622
Stock boy. What do you think?

347
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,203
You're not gonna
work at that place.

348
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,308
Yeah, but, you know,
you start off...

349
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:21,476
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

350
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:22,560
- if you go there.
- I know.

351
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,811
It's sales. You work your way up,

352
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:25,021
you'll be a general manager.

353
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,731
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

354
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,254
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

355
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,128
You understand that nobody's
hiring stockbrokers right now?

356
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,505
You understand that?

357
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,176
Okay?

358
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,182
Ah. This place is.

359
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,473
- What?
- What's that say?

360
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:43,849
"Stockbrokers."

361
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:46,792
In Long Island?
Stockbrokers in Long Island?

362
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,019
Yeah.

363
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,189
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

364
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:12,007
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Investor's Center.

365
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,926
What's that? You want to invest?

366
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,781
No. Investor's Center.

367
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,054
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

368
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:20,743
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

369
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:21,786
Oh.

370
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,454
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

371
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,398
Hi, Dwayne.
We spoke on the phone.

372
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:27,059
I'm Jordan Belfort.

373
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,403
I'm the broker from Rothschild
in New York.

374
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,237
Yes, yeah. Have a seat.
How are you?

375
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:32,797
We had a conversation...

376
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,131
We spoke on the phone
earlier, right?

377
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:35,550
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

378
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,652
Yeah.

379
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:40,784
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

380
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,682
It's 3 cents a share, that's $3!

381
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,251
You cheap fuck!

382
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,185
So, uh...

383
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,914
So where are your Quotrons here?

384
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,190
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

385
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:52,567
No, no.
We don't even need computers here.

386
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,386
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

387
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,262
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

388
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,197
You know, uh, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

389
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,470
they don't have enough capital?

390
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:00,658
Their shares trade here.

391
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,432
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

392
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,413
This one, uh, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

393
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,872
Or Aerotyne...

394
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,441
Aerotyne, yeah.

395
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,152
Aero... Aerotyne...

396
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:11,586
Aerotyne. Yeah.

397
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:12,795
Very hot stock right now.

398
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:13,879
Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,172
They're just a couple of brothers
that are making

400
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:16,591
radar detectors out
of their garage.

401
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:17,675
They're out in Dubuque.

402
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,010
Maybe it's microwaves.
I'm not sure.

403
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,511
But you call the
company's main line,

404
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:22,430
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

405
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,432
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

406
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,183
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

407
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:28,958
Six cents a share?

408
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,791
Hey, come on.
Who buys this crap?

409
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:33,004
Well, I mean...

410
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,400
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

411
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:36,503
Postmen, there's always postmen.

412
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,487
Uh, plumbers. Um...

413
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,031
They see our ads in
the back of, uh,

414
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,616
<i>Hustler and Popular Mechanics.</i>

415
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:44,561
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

416
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,828
<i>- Hustler?
- Yeah.</i>

417
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,121
You know, those girlie magazines.

418
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,690
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

419
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:49,874
- A lot.
- Yeah.

420
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,584
We're helping them finance houses,

421
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,544
we're helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring...

422
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:54,712
A boat maybe.

423
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,657
Is this... Is this stuff
regulated or are you guys...

424
00:18:57,674 --> 00:18:58,866
What are you doing here?

425
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:00,944
Uh...

426
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:02,745
Sort of.

427
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:03,989
Sort of?

428
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:08,225
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

429
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,602
Yeah. And that's
the point, that's...

430
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:10,770
What's your name again?

431
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,168
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

432
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,128
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

433
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:17,253
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

434
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,220
Pink sheets, it's 50.

435
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,384
It's 50%?

436
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,598
50% commission?

437
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,187
- Yup.
- For what?

438
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,564
It's our markup for our services.

439
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,375
And so if I... If I...

440
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:36,606
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

441
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,131
If you sell $10,000
worth of this stock,

442
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,405
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

443
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:44,845
And I hope it happens.

444
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:48,942
<i>Hello, John,
how are you doing today?</i>

445
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:51,602
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

446
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,396
requesting information
on penny stocks

447
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,523
that had huge upside potential

448
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,274
with very little downside risk.

449
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,276
<i>- Does that ring a bell?
- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

450
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:02,488
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

451
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:05,217
something just came
across my desk, John.

452
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:06,617
It is perhaps the best thing

453
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,119
I've seen in the last six months.

454
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,995
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

455
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,288
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

456
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:12,415
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

457
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,959
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

458
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,314
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm
out of the Midwest

459
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,381
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

460
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,967
on the next generation
of radar detectors

461
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:27,574
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

462
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:28,973
Right now, John,

463
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,434
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

464
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,811
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

465
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,188
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that.

466
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:39,233
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

467
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:42,258
would be upwards of $60,000!

468
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:43,863
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

469
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,531
Exactly.
You could pay off your mortgage.

470
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,116
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

471
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,993
John, one thing I can promise you,

472
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,311
even in this market,

473
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,121
is that I never ask my clients

474
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:53,599
to judge me on my winners.

475
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,569
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

476
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,211
And in the case of Aerotyne,

477
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,922
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

478
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:05,152
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

479
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:08,095
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i>

480
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:10,415
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

481
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:11,932
Let me lock in that trade right now

482
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,309
and get back to you
with my secretary

483
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,311
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

484
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:16,664
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.
- Great.</i>

485
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,897
Hey, John.

486
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:19,545
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

487
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,525
And welcome to the
Investor's Center.

488
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:22,673
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

489
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,095
Bye-bye.

490
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:29,158
How'd you fucking do that?

491
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,913
<i>Just like that,
I made 2 grand.</i>

492
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:36,813
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

493
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,607
Great! Even better!

494
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,712
<i>I was selling garbage
to garbage men</i>

495
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,315
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i>

496
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,070
The only problem you're gonna
have is that you didn't buy more.

497
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:47,968
Boom shocka locka!

498
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,012
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

499
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:53,516
<i>But the way I looked at it, their
money was better off in my pocket.</i>

500
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,460
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

501
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,209
<i>Excuse me.
Is that your car in the lot?</i>

502
00:21:58,396 --> 00:21:59,713
Yeah.

503
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:01,750
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

504
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,005
Donnie Azoff.

505
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,151
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

506
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,513
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

507
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,404
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

508
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,178
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

509
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,075
I think we live in
the same building.

510
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,243
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,062
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

512
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,246
Fourth floor.

513
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,190
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

514
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,189
What do you do, bro?

515
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,192
What do you mean, what do I do?

516
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,463
For work, what do you do?

517
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:25,690
I'm a stockbroker.

518
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,572
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

519
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:29,240
Children's furniture.

520
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:30,594
Oh, good for you.

521
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,038
It's all right.

522
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:33,616
You make a lot of money?

523
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,751
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

524
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,085
I'm trying to put it together.

525
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,562
You got your fucking nice car,

526
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,105
we live in the same
building. I just...

527
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

528
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:47,679
I don't know.
$70,000 last month.

529
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:49,556
Get the fuck...

530
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:51,386
Get the fuck out of here.

531
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:52,763
No, I'm serious.

532
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:54,056
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

533
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,221
Seriously,
how much money do you make?

534
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,561
I told you. $70,000.

535
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,230
Well, technically, $72,000.

536
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:03,236
Last month. Something like that.

537
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,297
You made 72 grand in one month?

538
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,570
Yeah.

539
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,287
I'll tell you what.

540
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:16,473
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

541
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,827
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

542
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,301
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

543
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,717
No, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's fine.

544
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:31,215
Hey, listen, I quit.

545
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,175
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

546
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,450
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i>

547
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:36,224
<i>I mean, I just met
this fucking guy.</i>

548
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:38,184
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

549
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:39,580
<i>There were other
things about him, too.</i>

550
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,790
<i>Like his phosphorescent
white teeth.</i>

551
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,042
Wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

552
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:45,294
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses</i>

553
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,147
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

554
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,283
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

555
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,010
I heard some stupid shit.
I don't know.

556
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,409
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

557
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:57,456
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

558
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:59,683
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

559
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:02,207
I don't even listen
to it half the time.

560
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:03,872
What are they saying?

561
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,358
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

562
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,692
I don't even listen to it.

563
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,342
Oh, bro, it's not like that.

564
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:12,680
It's not like that.

565
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:15,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?</font>

566
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:17,660
Yeah, <font color="#FFFFFF">my wife.</font> Yeah.

567
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife is my cousin, or whatever.</font>

568
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:22,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.</font>

569
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,358
Is she <font color="#FFFFFF">like a first</font>
cousin, or is she...

570
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, she's, you know...</font>

571
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:27,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her... Her father</font>

572
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:30,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the brother of my mom.</font>

573
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,199
It's <font color="#FFFFFF">not like, what...</font> You know.

574
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:33,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we grew up together.</font>

575
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:36,220
And <font color="#FFFFFF">she grew up hot, </font>you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

576
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,055
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

577
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:39,749
And I'm not gonna let someone...

578
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,725
You know, one of these
assholes fuck my cousin,

579
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,811
so, you know, I used
the cousin thing

580
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:45,289
as like an in with her.

581
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,856
I'm not gonna let someone
else fuck my cousin.

582
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:49,608
You know,
if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

583
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,568
it's gonna be me, out of respect.
You know?

584
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:52,736
No, I get it. Yeah.

585
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:55,056
I mean, you're not afraid of
like the whole kid thing, right?

586
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:56,323
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:57,641
No. We have two kids.

588
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:59,159
And they're... I mean...

589
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,829
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

590
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,024
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

591
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,025
But there's a big
chance, right, if...

592
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,419
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

593
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,024
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

594
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:13,240
That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

595
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:15,634
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

596
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,428
whether you're fucking
cousins or not.

597
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,264
What if something
like that happened?

598
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:21,932
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

599
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:25,352
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

600
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:27,104
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

601
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,378
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

602
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:30,875
You know?

603
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:37,156
You're completely fucking with me.

604
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:41,724
That's horrible.
You're not gonna...

605
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,412
You look like you've... No.

606
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,330
We would take it to,
like, an institution or somewhere

607
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,582
that's handled to, like, you know,

608
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,230
raise the kid or whatever.

609
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,836
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

610
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:52,004
No, I'm not fucking happy.

611
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:54,233
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

612
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,901
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

613
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:58,177
Listen, I'm really, you know...

614
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,576
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

615
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:01,847
I'm really enjoying it.

616
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,348
I'm really happy with
what you're doing.

617
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,497
Actually, I got you
a little present.

618
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,227
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

619
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:08,580
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

620
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:09,846
Yeah. It's in the back though.

621
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:12,421
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

622
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:14,802
Like it's wrapped up or something?

623
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,361
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

624
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:17,571
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

625
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,140
Let's fucking go. Come on.

626
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:21,325
Your turn.

627
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:22,409
I'm not fucking doing this.

628
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,557
You're out of your fucking mind.

629
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:25,579
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

630
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,664
No one's fucking here, bro.

631
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:28,812
Get the fuck...

632
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,667
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

633
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:31,835
I'm not fucking doing it.

634
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,671
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

635
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:37,116
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

636
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:39,110
Fucking nut job.

637
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,892
Wow!

638
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:06,645
Wow.

639
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,693
Let's go run, huh?

640
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,899
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

641
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:16,713
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

642
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:20,284
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

643
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:22,824
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

644
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,956
Let's fucking run! Go!

645
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,390
Go, go, go, go!

646
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:29,852
<i>You've reached
Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

647
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:31,395
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

648
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,498
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

649
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:35,274
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

650
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,735
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

651
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,321
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

652
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:43,740
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

653
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:45,742
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

654
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:47,744
<i>So I recruited some
of my hometown boys.</i>

655
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,788
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i>

656
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:50,998
<i>and weed.</i>

657
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,292
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i>

658
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,459
<i>and weed.</i>

659
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,404
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

660
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:58,777
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

661
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,405
Can you bring me some ketchup?
Okay?

662
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:02,885
<i>This is Brad.</i>

663
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:04,636
<i>And Brad's the guy
I really wanted.</i>

664
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:05,971
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

665
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:08,599
<i>He was already making so much
money selling Quaaludes,</i>

666
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,435
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

667
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,603
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

668
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:13,645
Yeah, man, of course.

669
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,606
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

670
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,982
Let 'em watch.

671
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:18,926
Let 'em watch.
Know what I mean?

672
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,014
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

673
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:26,260
Why don't you bring me a pair of her
panties next time you come through.

674
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,179
Yeah, man. She said she don't
want to talk to you anymore, man.

675
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,610
Get the fuck out of here.

676
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,732
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

677
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:35,818
Ma!

678
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:38,479
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

679
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:39,963
Every person you're
on the phone with,

680
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:42,591
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

681
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:43,800
They all want something
for nothing.

682
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:46,386
There was this one time that I was
selling pot to this Amish dude.

683
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:47,846
You know those guys
who got like the beard

684
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,995
with like no mustache
or some bullshit?

685
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,920
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

686
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,520
I don't understand.

687
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:56,793
What's that
got to do with anything?

688
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,754
What the fuck are
you talking about?

689
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:00,692
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

690
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,922
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

691
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:06,466
Holy fuck, you did
just say that.

692
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,825
What the fuck are
you talking about?

693
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:09,993
Yeah, like Buddhists.

694
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:11,036
They don't give a
shit about money.

695
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:13,121
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

696
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,957
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

697
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,416
I'm talking about normal people,

698
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,793
working-class, everyday people.

699
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:19,795
Everyone wants to
get rich. Am I crazy?

700
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,171
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

701
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:23,115
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

702
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,467
Can we get some ketchup, please?

703
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:26,927
Do you guys not
want to make money?

704
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:28,720
I want to make some money.

705
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,138
I want to make some
fucking money, okay.

706
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,456
I can sell anything.

707
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:33,517
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

708
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:35,518
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

709
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:37,459
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

710
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,147
Sell me this fucking
pen right here.

711
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:40,899
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

712
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,172
Sell me the pen.

713
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,962
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

714
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,427
Brad, show them how
it's done. Boom.

715
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:48,970
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

716
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,617
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

717
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:52,971
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

718
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:54,204
Why don't you do me a favor.

719
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:55,885
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

720
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:57,082
I don't have a pen.

721
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,151
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

722
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,294
Holy shit.

723
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:01,586
See what I'm saying?
He's creating urgency.

724
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,005
Get them to want to buy the stock.

725
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,881
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

726
00:30:04,882 --> 00:30:06,234
And that's the thing.

727
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,986
All nuns are lesbians.

728
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:09,845
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

729
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,471
Think about it.
They can't keep a dude

730
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:12,723
so they're gonna start
fucking chicks.

731
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,997
Four fucking times,
Kimmie! Four times.

732
00:30:15,018 --> 00:30:16,476
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

733
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:17,920
Now she runs.

734
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:20,881
<i>But look. I knew these
guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

735
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,566
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i>

736
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,860
<i>took five years to
finish high school.</i>

737
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:26,695
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i>

738
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:27,888
<i>didn't even graduate.</i>

739
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,073
<i>Chester Ming, the
depraved Chinaman,</i>

740
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:32,222
<i>thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

741
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:34,745
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

742
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:36,496
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

743
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:40,022
<i>I called him Rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

744
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:43,920
<i>Still, give them to me young,
hungry and stupid</i>

745
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:47,070
<i>and in no time,
I'll make them rich.</i>

746
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,490
Oh, my God.

747
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:51,870
Jordan, that...

748
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,263
You like it, baby?

749
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:55,116
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

750
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,601
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

751
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,579
but I promise they're
really high quality.

752
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:00,834
It's beautiful.

753
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:02,916
They're so beautiful.

754
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,630
Oh, boy.

755
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:06,109
What?

756
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,695
I know that look.
What is it? Go ahead.

757
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:10,423
I don't know, it's...
You know...

758
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:13,346
These stocks...
These companies...

759
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,452
They're like crappy companies.

760
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:16,850
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

761
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,314
Yeah, they're terrible.

762
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,457
Don't worry about it. I told you,

763
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,858
what I'm doing is completely legal.

764
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:22,959
Yeah, I know.

765
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,233
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

766
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:28,090
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

767
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,568
You know how it goes.

768
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,219
Wouldn't you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people

769
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,573
who can, like,
afford to lose all that money?

770
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:37,579
Of course.

771
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,707
But rich people don't
buy penny stocks.

772
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:42,664
They just don't.

773
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,291
Why not?

774
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:48,151
<i>Because they're too smart,</i>

775
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:49,504
<i>that's why not.</i>

776
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,531
<i>I mean, what person with
a college education</i>

777
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:53,907
<i>would trust this
bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

778
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,158
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

779
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:56,326
I got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now!

780
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:57,577
Hey!

781
00:31:57,578 --> 00:32:00,622
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

782
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:03,943
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

783
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,523
<i>Real money.</i>

784
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,030
<i>So I decided to
reinvent the company.</i>

785
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:10,450
Gentlemen, welcome

786
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:13,362
to Stratton Oakmont.

787
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:15,287
You schnooks will now be targeting

788
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,499
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

789
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,626
We're talking about whales here.

790
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:22,620
Moby fucking Dicks.

791
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:26,857
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

792
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:29,067
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

793
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:31,796
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

794
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,551
Get it? Huh?

795
00:32:33,573 --> 00:32:34,799
Captain who?

796
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:36,468
Captain Ahab.
From the fucking...

797
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:40,145
The book, motherfucker.
From the book.

798
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:42,205
Turn your fucking brain on.

799
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:43,623
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

800
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:46,694
Listen to me. We're a
new company with a new name.

801
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,781
A company that our
clients can believe in.

802
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:52,859
A company that our
clients can trust.

803
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:57,637
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

804
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:01,141
that our very founders sailed over
on the Mayflower

805
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:03,040
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

806
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,458
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

807
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:07,165
You got it?

808
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:09,065
What we're gonna do is this.

809
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:12,360
First we pitch 'em
Disney, AT&T, IBM,

810
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,321
blue chip stocks exclusively.

811
00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:16,595
Companies these people know.

812
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:20,687
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

813
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:22,871
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,

814
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:24,519
where we make the money.

815
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,726
- 50% commission, baby.
- Ooh.

816
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,836
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

817
00:33:29,837 --> 00:33:32,941
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

818
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,926
<i>Because by the time you read about
it in The Wall Street Journal,</i>

819
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:37,870
it's already too late.

820
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:40,096
Then you wait.

821
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:41,264
You wait.

822
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:43,959
And whoever speaks first loses.

823
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:47,212
<i>Sorry, uh...</i>

824
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,793
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

825
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:51,233
<i>I really have to give
this some thought</i>

826
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,068
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i>

827
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,261
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

828
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:55,862
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

829
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:58,281
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

830
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:00,200
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

831
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:03,787
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

832
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,497
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

833
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,225
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

834
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,085
So, what do you say?

835
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:13,338
You mean to tell me that if I put
you in at Union Carbide at 7

836
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,861
and took you out at 32...

837
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:17,509
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

838
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,178
U.S. Steel at 16,
took you out at 41...

839
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,805
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,"

840
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,682
"pick me up a few thousand
shares of Disney"

841
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:25,410
"on the spot, right now.
Come on."

842
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:27,310
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?
Seriously?

843
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:28,728
<i>I don't know you.</i>

844
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:31,082
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

845
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,274
I am in complete
agreement with you.

846
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,048
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

847
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,277
Let me introduce myself to you.

848
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:36,736
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

849
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:38,180
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

850
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:40,073
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

851
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,575
and I plan on being one of the...

852
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:43,952
top brokers in my firm next year.

853
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,993
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

854
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:48,039
<i>I do wanna say that
you sound like a...</i>

855
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,874
<i>You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.</i>

856
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,042
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i>

857
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,168
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

858
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,738
But what this trade
will do is serve as...

859
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:57,108
a benchmark
for future business, Kevin.

860
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,009
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

861
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,343
And then you'll know for sure

862
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,512
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

863
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:04,139
that you can trust,

864
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,835
and who can consistently
make you money.

865
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:09,336
Sound fair enough?

866
00:35:11,355 --> 00:35:13,332
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

867
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:15,960
<i>I gotta say,
I'm pretty impressed.</i>

868
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:19,112
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

869
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:20,214
Kevin.

870
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,741
You give me one shot here

871
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:25,452
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

872
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,704
and believe me, Kevin,

873
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:30,332
the only problem
you're gonna have

874
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,856
is that you didn't buy more.

875
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,486
Sound fair enough?

876
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,072
<i>Shit. My...</i>

877
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,488
<i>Uh...</i>

878
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:42,612
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

879
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:43,829
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

880
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:46,931
Excellent choice, Kevin.

881
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:48,830
How much do you
want to go for this time?

882
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,894
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i>

883
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,145
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

884
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:53,589
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

885
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,898
<i>- Ten.
- You want to do that?</i>

886
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:55,982
Excellent choice!

887
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:57,484
Kevin, let me lock in
that trade right now

888
00:35:57,485 --> 00:35:58,777
and get back to you
in a few minutes

889
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:00,236
with an exact
confirmation, Kevin.

890
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:02,906
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

891
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,180
<i>Thanks, man.
I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

892
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:06,409
<i>This is fun.</i>

893
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,682
Take it easy, Kev.

894
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,688
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan.
Thanks a...</i>

895
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,396
Fuck that motherfucker!

896
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,352
That's what I'm talking about!

897
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:19,110
What a fucking idiot.

898
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:22,656
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

899
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:26,114
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

900
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:27,330
Get in now or...

901
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:29,099
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

902
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,392
and I'm a Senior Vice President

903
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:31,710
with Stratton Oakmont.

904
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:35,965
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

905
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:37,482
When did he pass?

906
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,566
Just say I'm wrong, right.

907
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:39,693
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

908
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:41,277
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

909
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:44,155
God rest his soul,
"A shit ton of money."

910
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:45,365
It's like getting in
on fucking sunlight

911
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:47,013
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

912
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:48,910
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

913
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,479
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

914
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:53,581
That's a very intelligent decision.

915
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:55,342
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

916
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,228
Rhonda!

917
00:36:57,878 --> 00:36:59,254
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

918
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:01,073
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

919
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,805
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

920
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:09,998
Yeah!

921
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:12,475
<i>The end of the month.</i>

922
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:16,146
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

923
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,966
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

924
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:23,695
<i>And to celebrate with our
weekly act of debauchery,</i>

925
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,530
<i>I have offered our
lovely sales assistant,</i>

926
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,532
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

927
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:31,327
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

928
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,554
Yeah!

929
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:36,108
Yeah, you want this?

930
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,268
You want this?

931
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,778
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

932
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,172
Let the scalping begin!

933
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,286
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

934
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:51,431
<i>FYI, boys,
Danielle has promised</i>

935
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:54,476
<i>to use this $10,000
for breast implants!</i>

936
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:55,894
<i>She's already got C cups,</i>

937
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:57,997
<i>but now she wants
fucking double D's!</i>

938
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:00,712
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

939
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:06,047
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

940
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:10,471
<i>Donnie!</i>

941
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,979
<i>Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!</i>

942
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,255
- Champagne?
- Whoo!

943
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:50,636
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

944
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,043
Mine!

945
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,752
<i>Word about us
spread throughout Wall Street.</i>

946
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,730
<i>Even the places I
didn't want it to.</i>

947
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:58,808
<i>It wasn't long before
Forbes magazine,</i>

948
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:01,644
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.</i>

949
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:05,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?</font>

950
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:06,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">One word?</font>

951
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diversification.</font>

952
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:12,196
Sounds good. <font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much.</font>
I have more than enough.

953
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:13,281
- <font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.</font>

954
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:14,383
Can <font color="#FFFFFF">we get a quick picture?</font>

955
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:18,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i></font>

956
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:21,144
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This conniving little twat!
Look at this!</i></font>

957
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.</font>

958
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:25,315
Your <font color="#FFFFFF">hair looks</font> good.

959
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:26,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, my hair looks good.</font>
- Yeah.

960
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:28,338
"Jordan Belfort,"

961
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,924
"sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood"

962
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:33,653
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself"

963
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:35,511
"and his merry little
band of brokers."

964
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:36,989
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

965
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:40,892
There is no such thing as
bad publicity, sweetheart.

966
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,336
Read the article, babe.

967
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:45,039
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

968
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:46,416
Big fucking deal I look great.

969
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:49,317
Mr. Belfort!
Can you look at my resume, please?

970
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,341
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

971
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,216
Calm the fuck down!

972
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:57,096
What the hell's all this?

973
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:00,020
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

974
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,204
Hey! What did I say?

975
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,522
I'm just trying to be nice.

976
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:05,442
Hey, you want a job,
you talk to me!

977
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:06,810
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

978
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:09,526
Forbes made me a superstar.

979
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:15,578
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

980
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:19,555
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

981
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:21,265
<i>and spent whatever
allowance they had</i>

982
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,768
<i>on a new suit from
our Stratton tailor.</i>

983
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,416
Are you fucking serious right now?

984
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:29,588
<i>I mean, we were literally putting
clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

985
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,211
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

986
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:35,905
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

987
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:39,385
<i>there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

988
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,889
<i>Within months,
we doubled in size,</i>

989
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:44,731
<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i>

990
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:53,399
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

991
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:55,029
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

992
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,030
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

993
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:00,614
Yes!

994
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,226
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

995
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,204
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

996
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:09,939
<i>But I'm telling you,
even that didn't help.</i>

997
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,109
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

998
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,652
<i>when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

999
00:42:14,653 --> 00:42:16,863
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

1000
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,448
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

1001
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,450
<i>Her name was Pam,
and to her credit,</i>

1002
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,785
<i>she did have this
amazing technique,</i>

1003
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:25,560
<i>with this wild twist
and jerk motion.</i>

1004
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:27,081
<i>About a month later,</i>

1005
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,083
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

1006
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:30,334
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

1007
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:33,188
<i>while our wives were out shopping
for Christmas dresses.</i>

1008
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:34,839
<i>Eventually,
Ben married her,</i>

1009
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,383
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

1010
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:39,782
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

1011
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:43,123
<i>Then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later.</i>

1012
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:47,643
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

1013
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:49,746
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

1014
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,275
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

1015
00:42:54,276 --> 00:42:55,735
<i>which could be set
off by something</i>

1016
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:57,737
<i>as innocuous as a
ringing telephone.</i>

1017
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:02,075
Who the fuck has
the goddamn gall

1018
00:43:02,076 --> 00:43:04,804
to call this house
on a Tuesday night?

1019
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:07,038
God damn it!

1020
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,164
You're gonna miss it!

1021
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,083
Ooh, please, tell me
something I don't know.

1022
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:12,919
<i>I wait all week for
the fucking Equalizer</i>

1023
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,296
and they have to fucking...
Hello.

1024
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:17,090
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

1025
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,488
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1026
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:20,510
<i>He'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

1027
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:22,363
Right-o, Gene,
that'd be great.

1028
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:24,097
Cheerio.

1029
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,181
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

1030
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,849
The fucking halfwit!

1031
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,975
<i>- He'd hang up...
- You missed it!</i>

1032
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:29,999
<i>And then he's Mad
Max all over again.</i>

1033
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:31,455
Damn it!

1034
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,378
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

1035
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:35,942
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

1036
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:37,443
Who's he? Who?
Tell me who...

1037
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:39,112
The main guy.
You know who the main...

1038
00:43:39,113 --> 00:43:40,279
The main guy...

1039
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,724
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

1040
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,701
<i>Of course,
Mad Max didn't have to know</i>

1041
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:47,520
<i>everything we were
doing at Stratton.</i>

1042
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:49,644
And then there's a
big target and we...

1043
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:51,646
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

1044
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,876
<i>There's a bull's-eye
and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

1045
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:55,044
<i>Whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign...</i>

1046
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:56,087
gets the most points.

1047
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:58,381
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

1048
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:00,383
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1049
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:01,717
'Cause we're gonna
get fucking nuts.

1050
00:44:01,718 --> 00:44:03,052
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

1051
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:04,929
They got like superhuman strength.

1052
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,222
I think he's gonna be fine.

1053
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:08,224
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

1054
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,475
You can't look him in the eye?

1055
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:11,249
That's a fact.
I saw it on PBS.

1056
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,187
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

1057
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:14,814
You gotta look at their chin.

1058
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:15,940
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

1059
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:17,024
but I'm looking at your chin.

1060
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:19,235
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

1061
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:21,237
<i>They're like the Mona Lisa.
They find eye contact,</i>

1062
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,885
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

1063
00:44:22,948 --> 00:44:24,174
And they lock in.

1064
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:26,723
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

1065
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,077
We're allowed to
throw shit at 'em.

1066
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:29,579
We're allowed to
throw food? Bananas.

1067
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,080
Any food. Correct.

1068
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:32,248
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

1069
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,083
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

1070
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:35,857
and like get some of the girls to,
you know,

1071
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:37,044
fondle him and shit like that.

1072
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,129
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

1073
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,213
Let's keep that in
our back pocket.

1074
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:41,299
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1075
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,401
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1076
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:43,843
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

1077
00:44:43,844 --> 00:44:45,970
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1078
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:47,263
They're top heavy
like a lawn dart.

1079
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,347
So they're built for accuracy.

1080
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:50,371
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

1081
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:51,559
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1082
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,977
His brother's the bowling ball.

1083
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:54,770
The brother,
you put a skateboard on him,

1084
00:44:54,771 --> 00:44:56,105
you strap him to a skateboard,

1085
00:44:56,106 --> 00:44:57,607
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

1086
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,317
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1087
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:01,402
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1088
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:03,571
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1089
00:45:03,572 --> 00:45:04,906
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1090
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:06,282
They are very ornery by the way,

1091
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,783
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1092
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:08,868
Safety first.

1093
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,036
Safety is first, all right?

1094
00:45:10,037 --> 00:45:11,954
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1095
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:13,706
ready to knock this fucker out.

1096
00:45:13,707 --> 00:45:15,958
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1097
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,043
A pellet gun maybe?

1098
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,252
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1099
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:19,733
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

1100
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:22,358
But I say we stick with
the loophole. Right? Okay?

1101
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:24,300
If we don't consider him a human,

1102
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,552
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1103
00:45:26,553 --> 00:45:27,678
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1104
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,722
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1105
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:31,557
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1106
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:33,501
is that these things gossip.

1107
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:35,144
They get together and they gossip.

1108
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:36,646
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1109
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,898
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1110
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,566
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1111
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,235
Like, it's gonna make
Stratton look bad.

1112
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,403
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1113
00:45:44,404 --> 00:45:47,508
When they come in, we treat
it just like one of us. Okay?

1114
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:50,887
One of us.
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1115
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:52,558
We accept them, one of us!

1116
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,348
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1117
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:55,748
We accept them, one of us.

1118
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:56,874
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1119
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,251
Jordan!
Your dad's coming.

1120
00:45:58,252 --> 00:45:59,820
Something about the
American Express bill.

1121
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:01,070
Can you get him out of here?

1122
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:02,280
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1123
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:03,611
No, I'm serious!

1124
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:06,050
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1125
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:07,619
You got any fucking stock forms?

1126
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,220
He's coming, he's coming.

1127
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:10,447
Make some shit up.

1128
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:12,578
I think if we short Pfizer...

1129
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:17,584
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1130
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:22,984
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1131
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:25,194
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1132
00:46:25,195 --> 00:46:26,529
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1133
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,030
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1134
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:31,977
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1135
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:33,808
Okay. No, no.
This could be explained.

1136
00:46:33,996 --> 00:46:36,315
Dad, we had clients.
The Pfizer clients.

1137
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:38,249
Right. The porterhouse
from Argentina.

1138
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,543
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1139
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:42,146
And you ordered all
the fucking sides.

1140
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,213
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1141
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:47,784
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1142
00:46:48,093 --> 00:46:50,161
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1143
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:52,138
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1144
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,661
That's why they were expensive.

1145
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:55,667
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1146
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,727
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1147
00:46:57,728 --> 00:46:59,501
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1148
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,398
Well, that's, uh...

1149
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,607
Yeah, Jordy,
what's EJ Entertainment?

1150
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:04,734
How do I describe this?

1151
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:05,860
Jord, what is that?

1152
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:08,055
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1153
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,173
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1154
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,283
Isn't that the perfect
description for it?

1155
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:14,952
That is what it is. But none
of these were charged to me.

1156
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:16,350
This is all of them.

1157
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:18,247
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1158
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,191
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1159
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,728
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1160
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:25,421
The IRS, they allow
for T&A. It's fine.

1161
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:26,714
T&E!

1162
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:27,862
T&E!

1163
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:29,008
Yeah. I said T&E.

1164
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:30,384
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1165
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:31,469
Yeah, you did.

1166
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,846
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1167
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:35,222
I know you're upset
about the dinner,

1168
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:39,602
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1169
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,312
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1170
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:42,688
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1171
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:44,106
Absolutely, no question.

1172
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:45,358
I'm trying to...

1173
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,484
I'm getting this close!

1174
00:47:46,485 --> 00:47:47,777
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1175
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:50,321
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1176
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:51,447
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1177
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,095
Why do you hold it in?
Why do you...

1178
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:54,867
Max, why do you hold it in?

1179
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:56,686
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here!

1180
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:59,101
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1181
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:01,229
What kind of hooker
takes credit cards?

1182
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:02,375
A rich one.

1183
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:04,794
<i>At Stratton,
there were three kinds of hookers.</i>

1184
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:07,171
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,
model material.</i>

1185
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:08,756
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1186
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:10,132
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i>

1187
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,634
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1188
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,578
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1189
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:17,306
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1190
00:48:17,307 --> 00:48:19,725
<i>They cost between
200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1191
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:22,295
<i>Finally, there were the
Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1192
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:25,272
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1193
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:26,607
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1194
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:29,068
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

1195
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:31,012
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1196
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:32,923
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1197
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,763
Ow! It's that slipped
disc thing again.

1198
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:38,311
I know what it is.
You know, too much...

1199
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,121
with EJ Entertainment.

1200
00:48:40,122 --> 00:48:41,205
Pops.

1201
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:42,649
How are things at home?

1202
00:48:42,707 --> 00:48:44,309
Well, not the best.

1203
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:46,937
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1204
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:48,504
It's like the smell...

1205
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,198
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1206
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:52,842
After a while it kind of fades away
a little bit.

1207
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:54,593
Yeah, well. It's
supposed to fade away.

1208
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:56,617
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1209
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,332
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1210
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:00,558
What do you think?
We're, we're...

1211
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,502
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1212
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:03,962
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1213
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:06,206
I want to stay married,
Dad, but...

1214
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:07,606
It's crazy out there.

1215
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,191
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1216
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:10,544
Oh, my God!

1217
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:12,194
They're fucking...

1218
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:14,196
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1219
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:16,641
I mean... I mean, it's
on a whole other level.

1220
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:18,305
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1221
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,848
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1222
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:21,308
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1223
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:23,648
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1224
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,730
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1225
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,420
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1226
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:30,504
It's a new world.

1227
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:32,548
They're bald from
the eyebrows down.

1228
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,152
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1229
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,577
Wow. A new world.

1230
00:49:37,095 --> 00:49:39,698
I was born too... Too early.

1231
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:42,000
I've never been a fan of the bush,
to be honest.

1232
00:49:42,184 --> 00:49:43,392
- Really?
- Yeah.

1233
00:49:43,393 --> 00:49:44,585
I don't mind it.

1234
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:45,954
Dad.

1235
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:48,498
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1236
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:49,857
How can I not get stressed out?

1237
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:51,317
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1238
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:52,568
I know they're knuckleheads

1239
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:54,922
but I need them to want to
live like me, you get it?

1240
00:49:55,113 --> 00:49:56,339
To live like me.

1241
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:57,803
Jordy.

1242
00:49:57,824 --> 00:50:01,645
One of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

1243
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:05,474
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

1244
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:08,944
Crazy? This is obscene.

1245
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:10,521
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1246
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:12,276
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1247
00:50:12,506 --> 00:50:14,779
<i>But who the fuck
wanted to live there?</i>

1248
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:18,616
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1249
00:50:21,264 --> 00:50:25,540
<i>We are about to
become fucking legends</i>

1250
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:27,545
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1251
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:32,107
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1252
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:35,178
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1253
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:39,883
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1254
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:45,730
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1255
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:48,290
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1256
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,583
This way we become
the underwriters.

1257
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:51,210
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1258
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:54,880
<i>Finding companies to
take public. IPOs.</i>

1259
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,757
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1260
00:50:56,758 --> 00:51:00,553
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

1261
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:01,871
We got Arncliffe International.

1262
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,472
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1263
00:51:03,473 --> 00:51:07,142
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1264
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:09,687
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1265
00:51:09,688 --> 00:51:12,792
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1266
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,922
Steve Madden.

1267
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:17,611
We own the fucking companies...

1268
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:19,488
We own the companies...

1269
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:21,512
<i>Don't know what
a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

1270
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:23,598
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1271
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,436
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1272
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:03,240
The Quaalude,

1273
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:06,201
<i>or lude, as it is
commonly referred to,</i>

1274
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,829
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1275
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,582
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1276
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,083
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1277
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:17,030
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1278
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,882
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1279
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:23,719
<i>that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i>

1280
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,198
<i>you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.</i>

1281
00:52:26,473 --> 00:52:30,168
<i>Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1282
00:52:30,185 --> 00:52:33,459
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.
Government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1283
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:35,665
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1284
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:39,094
<i>Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.</i>

1285
00:52:39,277 --> 00:52:42,130
<i>No shit,
you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1286
00:52:42,405 --> 00:52:44,678
<i>You people are all
shit out of luck.</i>

1287
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,283
What are you saying? What is it?

1288
00:52:46,284 --> 00:52:47,556
Steve Madden.

1289
00:52:47,577 --> 00:52:49,554
Steve Madden.

1290
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:50,930
Steve.

1291
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:52,181
Steve.

1292
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:53,916
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1293
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,377
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1294
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:58,105
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1295
00:52:58,797 --> 00:53:00,381
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

1296
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:01,840
His friend from
school, Steve Madden.

1297
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:04,718
<i>Steve Madden was the name in
women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1298
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,514
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1299
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:09,848
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1300
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:11,225
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1301
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:13,102
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1302
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:15,752
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1303
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:17,648
Women's shoes!

1304
00:53:17,649 --> 00:53:19,547
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

1305
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:22,236
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1306
00:53:22,237 --> 00:53:23,654
Steve.

1307
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:24,780
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1308
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,053
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1309
00:53:26,074 --> 00:53:27,926
Look at this. Look.

1310
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:35,874
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1311
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,398
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1312
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:40,763
You want to see
the Wolf handle this?

1313
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:44,693
She's hot.

1314
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,531
Cristy.

1315
00:53:51,558 --> 00:53:53,501
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1316
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:56,145
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1317
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:57,748
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1318
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:59,632
You got an awesome place here.

1319
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:01,984
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1320
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,257
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1321
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:04,587
Beautiful beach out there.

1322
00:54:04,612 --> 00:54:05,838
Blair Hollingsworth.

1323
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:08,098
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1324
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:09,851
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1325
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,226
You like to Jet Ski?

1326
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:12,870
I've never done it before.

1327
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:13,954
You've never
Jet Ski'd in your life?

1328
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:14,997
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1329
00:54:14,998 --> 00:54:16,540
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1330
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:17,791
How many times are
you gonna ask her?

1331
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,269
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1332
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:21,942
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1333
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:24,616
Okay. Sure.

1334
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,551
Hi. I'm Hildy.
Nice to meet you.

1335
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:29,620
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1336
00:54:29,763 --> 00:54:31,115
Yeah, I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.

1337
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,514
Just tell her I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

1338
00:54:32,515 --> 00:54:34,057
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1339
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,142
I might do that, but I'm having

1340
00:54:35,143 --> 00:54:36,643
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1341
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:38,687
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1342
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:40,009
Wait, wait.
Where you guys going?

1343
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:41,545
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1344
00:54:41,608 --> 00:54:43,301
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1345
00:54:43,526 --> 00:54:45,674
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1346
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:46,862
But we can stay for a drink...

1347
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:48,180
She's

1348
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:50,008
perfect.

1349
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,617
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1350
00:54:51,618 --> 00:54:52,701
She's perfect.

1351
00:54:52,702 --> 00:54:54,203
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

1352
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:55,977
You piece of...

1353
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:06,316
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.
He gets...

1354
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:07,716
Get the fuck out!

1355
00:55:07,717 --> 00:55:09,518
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1356
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:10,987
Yeah, Donnie!

1357
00:55:12,138 --> 00:55:14,139
Let him fucking
finish, Hildy.

1358
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,867
That's fucking rude.

1359
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:17,789
Have some fucking manners.

1360
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,754
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1361
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:26,173
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

1362
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,841
<i>Saturday Night Fever territory.</i>

1363
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:29,464
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1364
00:55:29,572 --> 00:55:31,824
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1365
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:32,991
Right.

1366
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:34,719
So I presume you're Italian?

1367
00:55:34,828 --> 00:55:35,994
On my dad's side.

1368
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:39,315
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1369
00:55:39,624 --> 00:55:40,896
I'm a mutt.

1370
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,401
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1371
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:44,816
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1372
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:47,589
My Aunt Emma.
She's the best.

1373
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.</font>

1374
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:52,052
That<font color="#FFFFFF"> explains</font> it then.

1375
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explains what?</font>

1376
00:55:53,137 --> 00:55:56,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">It explains you.
I mean, you're a duchess, right?</font>

1377
00:55:56,057 --> 00:55:58,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Duchess of Bay Ridge.</font>

1378
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

1379
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:04,715
Could I get a straw,<font color="#FFFFFF"> please?</font>

1380
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:07,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1381
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I was, um, a little surprised</font>

1382
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:15,639
you asked<font color="#FFFFFF"> Cristy for </font>my number.

1383
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:17,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that?</font>

1384
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you married?</font>

1385
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:25,210
Well... Yeah, but what?

1386
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:27,234
Married people can't have friends?

1387
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,075
We're gonna be friends?

1388
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:35,239
Yeah. You don't want
to be my friend?

1389
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,332
We're not gonna be friends.

1390
00:56:49,694 --> 00:56:52,263
And at night I work on my designs.

1391
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,032
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1392
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:58,012
You know, camisoles,
bustiers, panties.

1393
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:01,413
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1394
00:57:01,414 --> 00:57:03,232
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1395
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:16,196
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1396
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:23,787
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1397
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,748
Tea? Yeah.

1398
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:28,732
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1399
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:30,130
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1400
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,512
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,
I wanted to come up for tea.</i>

1401
00:57:32,695 --> 00:57:35,656
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1402
00:57:35,657 --> 00:57:36,698
Sure.

1403
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:37,971
This is Rocky.

1404
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,478
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1405
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,937
Hi, sweetheart.

1406
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:43,143
Okay.

1407
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:46,309
Why don't you light a fire or
something and I'll be right out.

1408
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:48,732
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1409
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:53,695
I like your painting here.
It's, uh...

1410
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:03,452
<i>God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1411
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:08,063
You all right?

1412
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,508
Yeah, yeah.
Just trying to light the fire here.

1413
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,698
<i>That's it. That's it,
you're leaving.</i>

1414
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:19,676
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1415
00:58:29,544 --> 00:58:31,420
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1416
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,115
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1417
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:35,924
Jesus Lord!

1418
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:40,405
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1419
00:58:51,149 --> 00:58:52,796
Did you just come?

1420
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:54,840
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1421
00:58:55,778 --> 00:58:57,221
Did you? Did you come?

1422
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,947
- No.
- No?

1423
00:58:58,948 --> 00:59:00,174
Okay.

1424
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:02,393
I'm still hard so
just give me a sec.

1425
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:04,891
Sure.

1426
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:06,848
Come on, baby, come on.

1427
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:11,569
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1428
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:18,818
Oh, God!

1429
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,820
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1430
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:22,137
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1431
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:23,239
It's okay.

1432
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:25,015
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1433
00:59:25,016 --> 00:59:26,993
Go play, Rocky.
Go, go, go, go.

1434
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:30,812
You're crazy.

1435
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,147
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1436
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:34,608
<i>I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.</i>

1437
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:37,444
<i>And it wasn't just
about the sex, either.</i>

1438
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:39,488
<i>Naomi and I got along.
I mean, we...</i>

1439
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:41,466
<i>We had similar
interests and shit.</i>

1440
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:48,431
Ooh. Choo-choo train.

1441
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:49,815
Yeah.

1442
00:59:56,881 --> 01:00:00,702
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1443
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:09,999
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1444
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:11,728
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1445
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:13,206
Oh, shit!

1446
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:24,950
You!

1447
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,077
Get out of the fucking car!

1448
01:00:27,078 --> 01:00:28,495
Jesus Christ.

1449
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:31,145
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1450
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,276
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1451
01:00:34,752 --> 01:00:37,045
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1452
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:38,489
Okay, babe, stop!

1453
01:00:38,756 --> 01:00:40,779
- Please.
-  Bitch!

1454
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,176
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1455
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:44,761
Jesus Christ!

1456
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:45,887
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1457
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:47,264
I thought you were at
the fucking beach!

1458
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:48,708
I didn't know you were here!

1459
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,308
That's where you've
fucking been?

1460
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:52,060
With that fucking
whore from the party?

1461
01:00:52,061 --> 01:00:53,603
I thought you were
at the beach house.

1462
01:00:53,604 --> 01:00:55,063
How could you do this to me?

1463
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:57,899
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1464
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,777
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1465
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:04,007
I made a mistake. I don't know
what to tell you, babe. I...

1466
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:05,679
I'm sorry.

1467
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:08,386
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1468
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:20,190
Do you love her?

1469
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,363
Answer me.

1470
01:01:48,868 --> 01:01:51,016
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1471
01:01:51,787 --> 01:01:53,788
<i>Three days later,
I filed for a divorce</i>

1472
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,891
<i>and moved Naomi
into the apartment.</i>

1473
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:01,379
<i>Say what you will,</i>

1474
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,632
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1475
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,885
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1476
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:09,012
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1477
01:02:09,013 --> 01:02:11,973
<i>This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.</i>

1478
01:02:11,974 --> 01:02:13,701
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1479
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:15,123
Is that jasmine?

1480
01:02:15,394 --> 01:02:18,122
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1481
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:20,065
Very good. Great nose.

1482
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:21,839
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

1483
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:28,257
Oh, my God!

1484
01:02:29,992 --> 01:02:31,435
Oh, hey.

1485
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:33,229
Is it Wednesday already?

1486
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,497
- Uh...
- Oh, don't stop.

1487
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:36,690
What the fuck!

1488
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,776
That is fucked up!

1489
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:40,460
He must have thought
we were still

1490
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:42,128
at the Hamptons this weekend,
you know.

1491
01:02:42,129 --> 01:02:43,588
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1492
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:46,341
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1493
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:47,676
There were more over here.

1494
01:02:47,677 --> 01:02:49,219
- There were four right here.
- Ugh!

1495
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,971
Are you fucking serious?
Right there?

1496
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:53,848
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1497
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:57,958
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

1498
01:02:57,979 --> 01:02:59,126
Right. What?

1499
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:01,332
What is it, babe?
What?

1500
01:03:01,565 --> 01:03:02,732
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1501
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:03,817
I don't know where your money...

1502
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:05,902
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1503
01:03:05,903 --> 01:03:07,946
I don't know where your money is,
Mr. Belfort.

1504
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:10,282
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1505
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:11,658
He's lying through
his fucking teeth.

1506
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:12,909
Let's start from the beginning.

1507
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,202
Let's start from the
beginning, all right?

1508
01:03:14,203 --> 01:03:15,896
You invited some
friends over, right?

1509
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:17,831
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1510
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:19,374
We understand that, we do.

1511
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,918
We do blow all the time. We're
fucking degenerates ourselves.

1512
01:03:21,919 --> 01:03:23,086
Look at us, right?

1513
01:03:23,087 --> 01:03:24,754
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1514
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:26,381
Right from my sock drawer.
All right?

1515
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,591
Like I said,
I don't know where your money is.

1516
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,051
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1517
01:03:30,052 --> 01:03:31,177
It was just a normal day.

1518
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:32,554
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1519
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:34,931
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1520
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,891
I got a little high at breakfast.

1521
01:03:36,892 --> 01:03:38,810
So I got a little happy.
I had some eggs,

1522
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:39,894
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1523
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:41,813
And then I said, "Who do I
know that likes ice cream?"

1524
01:03:41,814 --> 01:03:43,356
It's my friend, Rudy.
So I called Rudy.

1525
01:03:43,357 --> 01:03:45,926
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1526
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:50,739
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1527
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,990
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1528
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:53,116
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1529
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:54,242
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1530
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:55,827
You know who Rudy was.
Dancing...

1531
01:03:55,828 --> 01:03:57,976
You know who Rudy is?

1532
01:03:58,956 --> 01:04:00,415
I don't fucking know any...

1533
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,458
What do you mean?

1534
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:02,625
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1535
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:04,294
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1536
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:05,920
On the stage, grinding
with everybody.

1537
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:07,568
I got fucked up.
I like to dance.

1538
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,591
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1539
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:11,319
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1540
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,094
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1541
01:04:13,095 --> 01:04:14,429
from my fucking sock drawer!

1542
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,014
All my girlfriend's
jewelry is gone.

1543
01:04:16,015 --> 01:04:18,016
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1544
01:04:18,017 --> 01:04:20,143
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1545
01:04:20,144 --> 01:04:21,917
Did he? Answer me!

1546
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:24,502
Okay. Now I get it.
Now I get why I'm...

1547
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:25,754
- This is a gay thing.
- Oh!

1548
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,692
See, all of you...

1549
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:29,213
You think this is
'cause you're a fag?

1550
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,196
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1551
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:33,615
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1552
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:34,866
You were in charge, right?

1553
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:36,618
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1554
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:38,912
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1555
01:04:38,913 --> 01:04:40,288
He should've hired
a fucking Mexican

1556
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:41,641
like I have in my fucking house.

1557
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,860
Shit! What the fuck...

1558
01:04:48,964 --> 01:04:50,423
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1559
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:51,633
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1560
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,051
Where is it?

1561
01:04:53,052 --> 01:04:56,096
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1562
01:04:56,097 --> 01:04:57,263
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1563
01:04:57,264 --> 01:04:58,411
I don't know!

1564
01:04:58,974 --> 01:05:02,123
<i>I had to call the cops just to
keep them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1565
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:03,645
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i>

1566
01:05:03,646 --> 01:05:05,840
<i>and told them what
Nicholas had done.</i>

1567
01:05:06,023 --> 01:05:07,500
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1568
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:09,339
Thanks again, Officer.

1569
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:12,320
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1570
01:05:12,321 --> 01:05:13,988
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

1571
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:16,366
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

1572
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:19,202
<i>Now a rathole is a
friend, like Brad here,</i>

1573
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:21,830
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1574
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:24,165
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1575
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:26,793
<i>I'd drive the price up
then he'd sell</i>

1576
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:29,003
<i>and kick most of the
profits back to...</i>

1577
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:30,981
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1578
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:36,261
<i>All cash. None of
it's on the books.</i>

1579
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:38,615
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1580
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:42,668
<i>Enter our new securities attorney,
Manny Riskin.</i>

1581
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:46,396
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1582
01:05:46,397 --> 01:05:48,189
Listen to me.
You piss up the SEC's leg,

1583
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,524
you end up with your
tits in a ringer.

1584
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:52,629
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1585
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:55,472
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1586
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,906
Hey! Hey!

1587
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:58,366
What are you doing? Hey!

1588
01:05:58,367 --> 01:05:59,810
We got the SEC in here.

1589
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:02,495
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

1590
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:05,165
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1591
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,167
<i>So I set them up in
our conference room</i>

1592
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:08,334
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1593
01:06:08,335 --> 01:06:10,628
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1594
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:12,213
<i>that it felt like
Antarctica in there.</i>

1595
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:14,299
Is it always this cold in here?

1596
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,383
I don't know.

1597
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:16,676
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1598
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,178
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1599
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:20,077
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1600
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:23,391
<i>I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here,</i>

1601
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:25,727
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1602
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:28,313
An IPO is an initial
public offering.

1603
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:32,150
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1604
01:06:32,151 --> 01:06:34,068
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1605
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:35,862
we set the initial sales price

1606
01:06:35,863 --> 01:06:38,682
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1607
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,408
Look.

1608
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:42,386
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1609
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:44,412
That's okay.
That doesn't matter.

1610
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,331
The real question is this.

1611
01:06:46,332 --> 01:06:48,291
"Was all this legal?"

1612
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:50,269
Absolutely fucking not.

1613
01:06:50,544 --> 01:06:53,022
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1614
01:06:57,468 --> 01:06:58,551
<i>And what do you do
when you're making</i>

1615
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:00,325
<i>more money than you
know what to do with?</i>

1616
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:07,540
Oh, my God!

1617
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:09,538
Will you marry me?

1618
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:11,439
Oh, my God.

1619
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,542
Is that a yes?

1620
01:07:14,109 --> 01:07:15,276
Are you sure?

1621
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:17,254
Yeah, I'm sure.
Yeah, I'm sure.

1622
01:07:17,446 --> 01:07:19,014
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1623
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:33,195
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1624
01:07:33,295 --> 01:07:35,648
<i>The flight there alone
was a bacchanal.</i>

1625
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:37,799
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i>

1626
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,868
<i>before I settled down for good.</i>

1627
01:07:40,135 --> 01:07:41,636
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1628
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:44,581
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more
waiting once we landed.</i>

1629
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:46,266
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1630
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:50,213
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1631
01:08:19,508 --> 01:08:22,953
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me 2 million bucks,</i>

1632
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:28,075
<i>including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.</i>

1633
01:08:29,393 --> 01:08:30,476
Kiss the bride.

1634
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,813
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i>

1635
01:08:33,814 --> 01:08:36,042
<i>was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1636
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:39,193
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1637
01:08:39,194 --> 01:08:40,778
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1638
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:43,928
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

1639
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:57,629
<i>Of course, after the bachelor
party, me, the Duke,</i>

1640
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,465
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1641
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:02,694
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1642
01:09:07,973 --> 01:09:09,825
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1643
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:11,372
A few words for your son?

1644
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:14,103
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1645
01:09:14,104 --> 01:09:17,315
It involves your penis
and her vagina.

1646
01:09:17,316 --> 01:09:20,386
And you know,
you know what you can do, Jordy.

1647
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:39,170
Oh, my God!

1648
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:40,648
Aunt Emma?

1649
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:46,737
I can't believe you came!

1650
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:50,411
Jordan! Jordan!
Look who came!

1651
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,201
It's Aunt Emma.

1652
01:09:53,268 --> 01:09:54,415
Aunt Emma.

1653
01:09:54,436 --> 01:09:56,880
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1654
01:09:57,648 --> 01:10:00,422
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

1655
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:02,402
Into the donuts, I see.

1656
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:04,779
Oh, I... I...

1657
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,881
Well...

1658
01:10:06,824 --> 01:10:09,242
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1659
01:10:09,243 --> 01:10:10,811
Enjoy the day.

1660
01:10:11,036 --> 01:10:13,309
She surprised me.
I didn't even know.

1661
01:10:27,469 --> 01:10:29,137
Just one more step.
Are you ready?

1662
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:30,805
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1663
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:32,249
One, two, three!

1664
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:35,744
What is this?

1665
01:10:35,936 --> 01:10:36,978
It's your wedding present.

1666
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,104
What?

1667
01:10:38,105 --> 01:10:40,424
It's your wedding present,
sweetheart.

1668
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:42,210
What?

1669
01:10:42,568 --> 01:10:44,777
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1670
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:45,925
A fucking yacht?

1671
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:48,990
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1672
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:51,826
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1673
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:55,037
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1674
01:10:55,038 --> 01:10:57,290
<i>is the color of cash.
Anchors aweigh!</i>

1675
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,644
Oh, my God! Baby!

1676
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:03,588
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1677
01:11:03,589 --> 01:11:05,111
- You like it?
- Yes!

1678
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:13,556
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,</i>

1679
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:15,641
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1680
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:16,809
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1681
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,504
<i>Seven acres on the Gold Coast
of Long Island.</i>

1682
01:11:19,521 --> 01:11:22,064
<i>The most expensive real estate
in the world.</i>

1683
01:11:22,065 --> 01:11:24,817
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1684
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:27,361
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1685
01:11:27,362 --> 01:11:28,805
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1686
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:34,770
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1687
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:39,040
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1688
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,875
- Ow!
- Who's Venice?

1689
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:42,293
- Huh?
- "Who?"

1690
01:11:42,294 --> 01:11:43,377
Who? Who?

1691
01:11:43,378 --> 01:11:45,129
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1692
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:46,422
Who is she?

1693
01:11:46,423 --> 01:11:47,882
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

1694
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:49,884
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1695
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,594
No way, baby, no!

1696
01:11:51,595 --> 01:11:53,993
You were calling her
name in your sleep!

1697
01:11:54,014 --> 01:11:56,742
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't...

1698
01:11:57,184 --> 01:11:58,893
I don't even know who Venice is.

1699
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,229
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

1700
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,083
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1701
01:12:07,736 --> 01:12:10,055
Venice...

1702
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:12,633
Venice, baby, where are you?

1703
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:14,639
Venice!

1704
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:16,846
Venice!

1705
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:18,579
Where'd you go?

1706
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:25,419
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1707
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,713
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1708
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:32,198
I like it. I like it. Ow.

1709
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,053
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1710
01:12:34,054 --> 01:12:35,096
Wolfie?

1711
01:12:35,097 --> 01:12:36,639
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1712
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,349
I don't give a fuck
about your safe word!

1713
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,309
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1714
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:42,788
- Ahh!
- Shut up, you little bitch!

1715
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:45,314
You're a fucking
dirty little birdy!

1716
01:12:45,315 --> 01:12:46,416
Owie!

1717
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:48,464
That's right.

1718
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:49,861
That's right! I forgot.

1719
01:12:49,862 --> 01:12:51,430
I forgot, baby.

1720
01:12:51,446 --> 01:12:53,614
Donnie and I were investing

1721
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:55,825
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1722
01:12:55,826 --> 01:12:57,034
That's why all this confusion.

1723
01:12:57,035 --> 01:12:58,619
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1724
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,454
Not Italy. California.

1725
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:02,039
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1726
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,249
You're a lying piece of shit!

1727
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,500
Duchess, baby, come on.

1728
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:06,148
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1729
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:07,795
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1730
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:10,900
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1731
01:13:10,924 --> 01:13:12,884
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1732
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,385
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1733
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:16,137
And you're still
acting like an infant!

1734
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:18,912
God damn it!

1735
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:21,915
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1736
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:24,312
Who is the one who flew in here

1737
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:27,273
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1738
01:13:27,274 --> 01:13:29,400
and woke up Skylar?
That was you!

1739
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:32,129
Oh, Skylar!
Oh, fucking bullshit!

1740
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:44,194
<i>Does it even matter to you</i>

1741
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:46,935
that I just had that driving range

1742
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:50,212
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1743
01:13:50,213 --> 01:13:52,131
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1744
01:13:52,132 --> 01:13:54,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you didn't research
the whole thing</font>

1745
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:56,344
and <font color="#FFFFFF">deal with the fucking
golf course people!</font>

1746
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God,</font>

1747
01:13:57,596 --> 01:14:00,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!</font>

1748
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:03,001
What <font color="#FFFFFF">a Greek tragedy, honey!</font>
Oh, my God!

1749
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!</font>

1750
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:07,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a fucking burden.</font>

1751
01:14:07,272 --> 01:14:09,315
And <font color="#FFFFFF">actually do some work
besides swiping</font>

1752
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:11,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">my fucking credit
card all day, huh?</font>

1753
01:14:11,526 --> 01:14:14,320
Because <font color="#FFFFFF">I can't keep track</font>
of your professions, honey.

1754
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:16,280
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1755
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:18,366
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1756
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:20,159
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1757
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,244
Don't fucking dare throw that

1758
01:14:22,245 --> 01:14:24,814
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1759
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:27,146
All right, honey?

1760
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:28,751
Now will you just...

1761
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:30,711
We could talk this out,
all right?

1762
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:33,156
We just use our words.
You know?

1763
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:34,340
Communicate.

1764
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:35,658
Okay?

1765
01:14:36,093 --> 01:14:37,490
Come on, sweetheart.

1766
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:39,537
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1767
01:14:39,554 --> 01:14:41,681
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1768
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:43,474
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1769
01:14:43,475 --> 01:14:44,558
Babe, come on.

1770
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:48,104
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1771
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:50,458
who's in such great
shape like this, huh?

1772
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:52,483
Come here.

1773
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,068
Come on, give me a kiss.

1774
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,236
You look so beautiful right now.

1775
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:56,445
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1776
01:14:56,446 --> 01:14:57,697
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1777
01:14:57,698 --> 01:14:59,425
Yeah, give me one...

1778
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:01,701
Fuck you!

1779
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,804
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1780
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:06,247
<i>First I'd get up and
fight with Naomi</i>

1781
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:08,541
<i>about whatever it is I did
the night before.</i>

1782
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:10,835
<i>Next was a steam so
I could sweat out</i>

1783
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:12,670
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1784
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:14,398
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1785
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:16,400
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1786
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:19,010
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1787
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:21,205
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1788
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,244
Good morning, Daddy.

1789
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:25,041
Where's my kiss?

1790
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,161
Whee!

1791
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,871
Hey, sweetheart.

1792
01:15:30,564 --> 01:15:33,607
Does Daddy get a kiss
from both of his little girls, huh?

1793
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:35,067
Oh, no.

1794
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:38,237
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1795
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:40,090
for a very, very,

1796
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:41,926
very long time.

1797
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:45,202
Daddy's really sorry about what
he said in the other room.

1798
01:15:45,203 --> 01:15:46,495
He didn't mean any of it.

1799
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:48,894
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1800
01:15:49,332 --> 01:15:51,025
And from now on,

1801
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:54,567
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1802
01:15:54,713 --> 01:15:57,032
short skirts around the house.

1803
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:02,120
And you know something else, Daddy?

1804
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:09,211
Mommy is just so sick and
tired of wearing panties.

1805
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:12,919
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1806
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:16,755
In fact,

1807
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:21,489
she's decided to throw them

1808
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:24,764
all away.

1809
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,442
So take a good look, Daddy.

1810
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:35,920
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house.

1811
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:37,546
Oh, baby...

1812
01:16:37,547 --> 01:16:39,115
Yeah, Mommy.

1813
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:41,531
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1814
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:43,703
Oh, gosh.

1815
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:46,410
Ow.

1816
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,892
What's wrong, Daddy?

1817
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:51,336
Mmm, baby.

1818
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:54,627
God!

1819
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,463
Look at this shit.

1820
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:01,347
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1821
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:05,680
Mommy, have you ever noticed

1822
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:07,636
anything odd about Mr...

1823
01:17:08,036 --> 01:17:09,729
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1824
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:15,019
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1825
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:18,963
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

1826
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:22,216
Yes!
I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1827
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:24,176
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1828
01:17:24,177 --> 01:17:25,636
<i>Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

1829
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:27,054
See that, huh?

1830
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:28,889
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1831
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,788
<i>she chooses today to
give me blue balls!</i>

1832
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,936
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day
in Stratton's history,</i>

1833
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:35,855
<i>and I needed to be
thinking straight.</i>

1834
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,333
Hey, Jordan!

1835
01:17:37,607 --> 01:17:39,525
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1836
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:42,755
<i>This was the day that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1837
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:44,947
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1838
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:46,824
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1839
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:47,950
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1840
01:17:47,951 --> 01:17:49,644
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1841
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:51,855
What's he doing?

1842
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:54,474
The biggest IPO in
this firm's history.

1843
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,856
What the fuck is he doing?

1844
01:17:57,752 --> 01:17:59,854
Is he...
Is he wearing a bow tie?

1845
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:01,238
Hi.

1846
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:03,424
How're you doing?

1847
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:04,572
Good.

1848
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:07,283
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1849
01:18:08,263 --> 01:18:10,457
I just...
I had a minute and...

1850
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:12,242
You had a minute.

1851
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:14,852
And today you needed to
clean the fish bowl? Today?

1852
01:18:14,853 --> 01:18:18,628
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1853
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:20,542
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1854
01:18:26,489 --> 01:18:27,841
On new issue day?

1855
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:32,058
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1856
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,392
This is what you do?

1857
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,353
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1858
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,603
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1859
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,126
Take your little bow tie,
get your shit,

1860
01:18:55,352 --> 01:18:57,269
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1861
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,872
Get the fuck out!

1862
01:19:02,442 --> 01:19:04,026
Everybody on point!

1863
01:19:04,027 --> 01:19:07,051
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1864
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:12,284
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1865
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:14,995
Jordan, look what I caught in
the lobby. I caught a genius.

1866
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:16,564
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1867
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:17,748
The great American cobbler.

1868
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:20,227
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i>

1869
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:23,879
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1870
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,701
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling
out of the primordial ooze.</i>

1871
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:29,785
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1872
01:19:30,011 --> 01:19:31,345
That's why they gotta
see your face.

1873
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:33,931
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1874
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:36,600
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1875
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:38,954
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1876
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:41,522
<i>which legally speaking
was a big no-no,</i>

1877
01:19:41,523 --> 01:19:45,048
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1878
01:19:45,277 --> 01:19:47,630
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1879
01:19:47,696 --> 01:19:49,594
<i>- But not too worked up.
- Shh.</i>

1880
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:52,805
Hello. If, uh...

1881
01:19:53,243 --> 01:19:55,471
For those of you who don't know me,
uh...

1882
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:56,829
My name's Steve Madden.

1883
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,664
Yeah, we know who you are.

1884
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:00,062
Your name is on the box.

1885
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,792
Get the shoes.
Show them the shoes.

1886
01:20:01,793 --> 01:20:03,486
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1887
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:06,714
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1888
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:09,675
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1889
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:11,343
Without it,
I wouldn't be here.

1890
01:20:11,344 --> 01:20:12,594
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1891
01:20:12,595 --> 01:20:14,663
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1892
01:20:14,681 --> 01:20:16,265
the Mary Lou is actually the same

1893
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:18,058
as the Mary Jane, but
it's black leather.

1894
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:24,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1895
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,297
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1896
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:28,902
All right!

1897
01:20:28,903 --> 01:20:32,281
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1898
01:20:32,282 --> 01:20:34,510
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1899
01:20:34,784 --> 01:20:37,103
Give him a round of applause!

1900
01:20:38,204 --> 01:20:40,432
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1901
01:20:41,249 --> 01:20:43,351
You having a good
afternoon or what?

1902
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:46,962
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1903
01:20:46,963 --> 01:20:49,361
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1904
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,194
It's because this man

1905
01:20:52,469 --> 01:20:54,162
is a creative genius.

1906
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:56,638
This ability, this gift

1907
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,241
that Steve has,

1908
01:20:58,266 --> 01:20:59,850
it goes beyond just

1909
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:01,602
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1910
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:05,503
Steve's power is that
he creates trends.

1911
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:06,879
You understand?

1912
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:09,526
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade.

1913
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:13,030
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1914
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:14,724
Yves Saint Laurent.

1915
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:16,843
Steve, come over here for a second.

1916
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:19,099
I don't think you all realize

1917
01:21:19,662 --> 01:21:21,139
that Steve Madden

1918
01:21:21,373 --> 01:21:24,750
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1919
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:26,126
with orders going through the roof

1920
01:21:26,127 --> 01:21:29,572
at every department store
in North America right now.

1921
01:21:29,964 --> 01:21:32,066
We have him here in our office!

1922
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:35,886
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here!

1923
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:38,555
We should be
on our hands and knees right now,

1924
01:21:38,556 --> 01:21:40,724
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1925
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:42,042
Like this! Okay?

1926
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,247
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1927
01:21:46,022 --> 01:21:47,715
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1928
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,650
This is our golden ticket

1929
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:51,777
to the fucking chocolate factory
right here!

1930
01:21:52,904 --> 01:21:54,051
And I wanna meet

1931
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:56,474
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1932
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:59,977
I wanna be with the
fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1933
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:06,435
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1934
01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:09,362
All right, I want you all
to focus for a second.

1935
01:22:09,796 --> 01:22:11,898
See those little black boxes?

1936
01:22:12,006 --> 01:22:13,173
They're called telephones.

1937
01:22:13,174 --> 01:22:16,051
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1938
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:18,746
They're not gonna dial themselves.
Okay?

1939
01:22:18,763 --> 01:22:22,584
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1940
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:26,796
Like a loaded M16 without a trained
Marine to pull the trigger.

1941
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:30,253
And in the case of the telephone,

1942
01:22:30,316 --> 01:22:33,044
it's up to each and
every one of you,

1943
01:22:34,446 --> 01:22:36,640
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1944
01:22:37,657 --> 01:22:39,054
My killers!

1945
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:43,101
My killers,
who will not take no for an answer!

1946
01:22:43,872 --> 01:22:45,565
My fucking warriors,

1947
01:22:45,915 --> 01:22:48,000
who will not hang up the phone

1948
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:51,044
until their client either buys

1949
01:22:51,045 --> 01:22:53,297
or fucking dies!

1950
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:09,897
Let me tell you something.

1951
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:13,002
There is no nobility in poverty.

1952
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:16,445
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1953
01:23:16,446 --> 01:23:18,447
And I choose rich
every fucking time.

1954
01:23:20,116 --> 01:23:21,408
Because at least as a rich man,

1955
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:22,868
when I have to face my problems,

1956
01:23:22,869 --> 01:23:24,828
I show up in the back of a limo,

1957
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:26,747
wearing a $2,000 suit

1958
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:29,476
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1959
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:34,796
Duke it out! Hit him!

1960
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:36,319
Get the fuck off me!

1961
01:23:37,675 --> 01:23:40,369
And if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial

1962
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:41,929
or materialistic,

1963
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:44,306
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1964
01:23:44,307 --> 01:23:46,455
'cause that's where
you fucking belong!

1965
01:23:48,436 --> 01:23:52,040
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1966
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:54,066
I want you to take a good look

1967
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:55,840
at the person next to you. Go on.

1968
01:23:56,861 --> 01:23:59,214
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1969
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:00,989
you're gonna be pulling
up to a red light

1970
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,058
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1971
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:06,453
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1972
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:08,682
in their brand new Porsche

1973
01:24:09,415 --> 01:24:11,500
with their beautiful
wife by their side,

1974
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:13,043
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1975
01:24:15,129 --> 01:24:17,464
And who're you gonna
be sitting next to?

1976
01:24:17,465 --> 01:24:19,299
Some disgusting wildebeest

1977
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,884
with three days of razor-stubble,

1978
01:24:20,885 --> 01:24:22,302
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1979
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:24,763
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1980
01:24:24,764 --> 01:24:26,598
from the fucking Price Club!

1981
01:24:26,599 --> 01:24:28,976
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1982
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:31,311
So you listen to me
and you listen well.

1983
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:33,665
Are you behind on your
credit card bills?

1984
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:36,255
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1985
01:24:36,568 --> 01:24:39,217
Is your landlord ready to evict you?
Good!

1986
01:24:39,404 --> 01:24:41,655
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1987
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:45,033
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1988
01:24:45,034 --> 01:24:47,978
Good! Pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1989
01:24:48,204 --> 01:24:50,432
I want you to deal
with your problems

1990
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:51,707
by becoming rich!

1991
01:24:53,876 --> 01:24:55,752
All you have to do today

1992
01:24:55,753 --> 01:24:57,275
is pick up that phone

1993
01:24:58,339 --> 01:25:00,908
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1994
01:25:01,509 --> 01:25:03,577
And I will make you richer

1995
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:05,137
than the most powerful CEO

1996
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:06,722
in the United States
of fucking America!

1997
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:08,325
Yeah!

1998
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:10,414
Fuck, yeah!

1999
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:13,129
I want you to go out there

2000
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:15,623
and I want you to ram

2001
01:25:15,857 --> 01:25:19,234
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

2002
01:25:19,235 --> 01:25:21,633
until they fucking choke on it!

2003
01:25:21,946 --> 01:25:24,114
Till they choke on it and they buy

2004
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:26,283
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

2005
01:25:26,284 --> 01:25:27,868
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

2006
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:29,642
You be ferocious!

2007
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:31,644
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

2008
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:35,064
You be telephone
fucking terrorists!

2009
01:25:36,419 --> 01:25:40,047
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

2010
01:26:10,328 --> 01:26:15,150
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

2011
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:18,357
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

2012
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:20,776
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.</i>

2013
01:26:30,598 --> 01:26:32,599
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

2014
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,602
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

2015
01:26:35,603 --> 01:26:37,922
Now once the price hit
the high teens...

2016
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:40,190
You know what?
Who gives a shit?

2017
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:41,918
As always, the point is this.

2018
01:26:42,276 --> 01:26:46,756
$22 million in three fucking hours!

2019
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:49,759
Can you believe this shit?

2020
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:52,244
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

2021
01:26:52,245 --> 01:26:53,471
Jordan!

2022
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:55,122
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

2023
01:26:55,123 --> 01:26:56,873
- from Future Video.
- Who?

2024
01:26:56,874 --> 01:26:58,166
I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

2025
01:26:58,167 --> 01:26:59,292
He says it's urgent.

2026
01:26:59,293 --> 01:27:01,503
Urgent?
Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

2027
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:03,171
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

2028
01:27:03,172 --> 01:27:04,297
You're in love with me?

2029
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:05,445
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

2030
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:06,550
Hey, Barry, what's up?

2031
01:27:06,551 --> 01:27:08,760
Listen, I got this subpoena.

2032
01:27:08,761 --> 01:27:10,303
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

2033
01:27:10,304 --> 01:27:11,888
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy

2034
01:27:11,889 --> 01:27:13,014
of your wedding video.

2035
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:14,287
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

2036
01:27:14,392 --> 01:27:16,309
<i>- You fucking kidding me?
- Listen to me.</i>

2037
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,686
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

2038
01:27:17,687 --> 01:27:19,438
<i>He's an agent with
the New York office.</i>

2039
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:20,564
<i>What's his problem?</i>

2040
01:27:20,565 --> 01:27:23,293
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks
you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

2041
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:25,819
What does he want
with my wedding video?

2042
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,529
It's like an invasion
of my privacy.

2043
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:28,973
You know what I'm saying?
It's like...

2044
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:30,365
It's intrusive, you know.

2045
01:27:30,366 --> 01:27:33,118
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

2046
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:35,036
Pictures, names of the people.

2047
01:27:35,037 --> 01:27:36,121
You know what he's trying to do?

2048
01:27:36,122 --> 01:27:37,330
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

2049
01:27:37,331 --> 01:27:38,623
He's trying to rattle you,

2050
01:27:38,624 --> 01:27:40,167
he's trying to rattle
your old lady,

2051
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:43,003
so she nags you
until you become a fucking witness.

2052
01:27:43,004 --> 01:27:44,504
He wants me to rat on myself?

2053
01:27:44,505 --> 01:27:46,448
He wants me
to give information about my...

2054
01:27:46,674 --> 01:27:48,341
Listen. The good
fucking news is,

2055
01:27:48,342 --> 01:27:50,177
you know I know
everybody downtown,

2056
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,512
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

2057
01:27:52,513 --> 01:27:55,708
nobody even knows you fucking
exist, so calm down!

2058
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:57,209
They don't know I exist?

2059
01:27:57,351 --> 01:27:59,124
- No.
- That's good.

2060
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:05,150
But you...

2061
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:06,719
You know who he is, right?

2062
01:28:07,361 --> 01:28:09,404
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

2063
01:28:09,405 --> 01:28:11,448
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

2064
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:14,701
you could go to
his house, right?

2065
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:16,703
Tap his phones a
little bit, bug him.

2066
01:28:16,704 --> 01:28:17,871
You could get some
information...

2067
01:28:17,872 --> 01:28:20,791
You don't fuck with
these guys like that.

2068
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:21,958
You don't fuck with
them like that.

2069
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,210
What are you, nuts or something?

2070
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:24,920
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

2071
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:28,089
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

2072
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,216
I'm not a cop anymore.

2073
01:28:29,217 --> 01:28:31,343
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

2074
01:28:31,344 --> 01:28:32,491
Okay.

2075
01:28:33,137 --> 01:28:35,490
Okay, if I can't do that,
can I just...

2076
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:37,033
Can I give the guy a call?

2077
01:28:38,142 --> 01:28:40,227
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

2078
01:28:40,228 --> 01:28:41,311
Do me a favor?

2079
01:28:41,312 --> 01:28:44,314
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

2080
01:28:44,315 --> 01:28:45,398
I can't call him, right?

2081
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:47,234
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

2082
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:48,985
whatever the fuck
you say to him,

2083
01:28:48,986 --> 01:28:51,696
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

2084
01:28:51,697 --> 01:28:53,532
He's smart, you're dumb.

2085
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:54,850
Fucking bullshit.

2086
01:28:55,368 --> 01:28:56,660
Are we fucking talking tonight,

2087
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:57,911
or are you gonna get schwacked?

2088
01:28:57,912 --> 01:28:59,579
The last time you took
these fucking pills,

2089
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:02,060
you put your head in the fucking
macaroni. I had to pick it up.

2090
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:04,209
All right.

2091
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,937
Okay, I won't call him.

2092
01:29:08,673 --> 01:29:10,841
Hey, fellas!
Come on board.

2093
01:29:10,842 --> 01:29:12,694
The plank's right around there.

2094
01:29:13,469 --> 01:29:14,821
Welcome!

2095
01:29:14,929 --> 01:29:16,906
Whoo! What a nice day.

2096
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:20,083
Hey.

2097
01:29:20,434 --> 01:29:21,831
Welcome aboard.

2098
01:29:22,478 --> 01:29:24,229
<i>Jordan. Welcome
aboard the Naomi.</i>

2099
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:25,355
Pleasure to meet you.

2100
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:26,857
Agent Denham.
This is Agent Hughes.

2101
01:29:26,858 --> 01:29:27,983
Hi, how are you?

2102
01:29:27,984 --> 01:29:31,319
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

2103
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,905
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

2104
01:29:33,906 --> 01:29:35,156
These are friends of Stratton.

2105
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:36,429
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

2106
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,723
Um...

2107
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:42,898
Your message said
that you wanted to speak privately.

2108
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:44,775
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

2109
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:46,189
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2110
01:29:46,377 --> 01:29:47,794
Let me know if I can
get you anything.

2111
01:29:47,795 --> 01:29:49,147
We'd be happy to help.

2112
01:29:49,881 --> 01:29:50,964
You guys hungry?

2113
01:29:50,965 --> 01:29:52,048
Want something to eat?

2114
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:53,884
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2115
01:29:53,885 --> 01:29:56,303
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2116
01:29:56,304 --> 01:29:57,888
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2117
01:29:57,889 --> 01:29:59,457
to drink while we're at sea.

2118
01:29:59,599 --> 01:30:00,700
Duh! Of course.

2119
01:30:01,976 --> 01:30:03,953
Ever been on one of these before?

2120
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:05,375
A boat?

2121
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,397
I learned how to
sail when I was six.

2122
01:30:07,398 --> 01:30:09,566
No shit. Is that right?
Really?

2123
01:30:09,567 --> 01:30:11,359
On one like this, though?

2124
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,259
I had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there.

2125
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,677
See that?

2126
01:30:16,866 --> 01:30:18,283
Anyway, this is for you.

2127
01:30:18,284 --> 01:30:21,328
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

2128
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:24,164
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2129
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:27,000
Figured this would help
expedite the whole process, right?

2130
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:28,835
- There you go.
- Look,

2131
01:30:28,836 --> 01:30:30,086
my point is that

2132
01:30:30,087 --> 01:30:31,838
I know you're
investigating Stratton.

2133
01:30:31,839 --> 01:30:35,443
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2134
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:37,928
I know we're a little unorthodox,
we're a little

2135
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:40,013
loud in the way we do things.
But you gotta understand,

2136
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:41,389
we're the new guys on the block,
you know,

2137
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:44,039
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2138
01:30:44,185 --> 01:30:46,834
But I want you to
understand, we don't

2139
01:30:46,854 --> 01:30:48,627
do anything illegal.

2140
01:30:49,357 --> 01:30:50,523
Whatsoever.

2141
01:30:50,524 --> 01:30:52,150
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2142
01:30:52,151 --> 01:30:55,195
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2143
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:57,640
I mean, I got...
I got nothing to hide.

2144
01:30:57,740 --> 01:31:00,825
Well, you know the SEC is
a civil regulatory agency.

2145
01:31:00,826 --> 01:31:02,452
We pursue criminal activities.

2146
01:31:02,453 --> 01:31:05,397
Exactly! You go after
real criminals, which

2147
01:31:05,873 --> 01:31:08,375
makes me wonder what the hell
you're investigating me for?

2148
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,399
I mean, honestly...

2149
01:31:10,628 --> 01:31:14,422
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2150
01:31:14,423 --> 01:31:15,757
Well, I...

2151
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:18,218
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2152
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:20,037
No, I get that.
No, I understand.

2153
01:31:20,054 --> 01:31:21,576
With that said...

2154
01:31:22,306 --> 01:31:24,224
This case got dumped
on my desk...

2155
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:25,892
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2156
01:31:25,893 --> 01:31:27,227
who needs to make a show

2157
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:29,437
of looking into the new company
on the block,

2158
01:31:29,438 --> 01:31:30,915
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2159
01:31:31,315 --> 01:31:32,816
And then I end up
being the schmuck

2160
01:31:32,817 --> 01:31:34,567
who does the looking. Exactly.

2161
01:31:34,568 --> 01:31:36,653
It's just, you know...
It bothers me.

2162
01:31:36,654 --> 01:31:38,071
We're the new guy.
We're the one

2163
01:31:38,072 --> 01:31:40,448
that's banging on Wall Street's door.
I mean, you should...

2164
01:31:40,449 --> 01:31:42,409
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

2165
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,012
I mean, I know all the information.

2166
01:31:44,078 --> 01:31:47,057
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2167
01:31:47,248 --> 01:31:49,066
Collateralized debt obligations?

2168
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:50,417
This Internet stock bullshit?

2169
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:52,293
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2170
01:31:52,294 --> 01:31:54,546
I could take you step-by-step

2171
01:31:54,547 --> 01:31:57,366
through what exactly is occurring.

2172
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,243
All you have to do is ask.

2173
01:31:59,301 --> 01:32:00,698
I'm available.

2174
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:02,429
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

2175
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:05,409
I don't see why a
little sitdown like this

2176
01:32:05,975 --> 01:32:07,600
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

2177
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:09,936
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2178
01:32:09,937 --> 01:32:11,584
- It should.
- Look.

2179
01:32:12,023 --> 01:32:14,315
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

2180
01:32:14,316 --> 01:32:17,340
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2181
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:19,263
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2182
01:32:21,741 --> 01:32:23,491
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

2183
01:32:23,492 --> 01:32:25,243
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2184
01:32:25,244 --> 01:32:26,971
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2185
01:32:29,999 --> 01:32:31,124
Let me ask you,

2186
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,625
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

2187
01:32:32,626 --> 01:32:34,899
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

2188
01:32:35,838 --> 01:32:38,548
Did you try to get
your broker's license at one time?

2189
01:32:38,549 --> 01:32:41,493
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2190
01:32:42,303 --> 01:32:44,304
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2191
01:32:44,305 --> 01:32:45,388
Who the fuck you
been talking to?

2192
01:32:45,389 --> 01:32:46,514
Well, you're investigating me.

2193
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:48,058
I hear things.

2194
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:49,502
You know what I mean?

2195
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:52,062
You ever think about
what would've happened

2196
01:32:52,063 --> 01:32:54,757
if you would have
stayed the course?

2197
01:32:55,941 --> 01:32:57,817
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2198
01:32:57,818 --> 01:32:59,194
and my balls are
fucking sweating,

2199
01:32:59,195 --> 01:33:01,071
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2200
01:33:01,072 --> 01:33:02,655
Yeah, you bet I do.

2201
01:33:02,656 --> 01:33:04,491
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2202
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:05,617
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2203
01:33:05,618 --> 01:33:06,785
What do you get...

2204
01:33:06,786 --> 01:33:08,119
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2205
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,579
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2206
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,729
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2207
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,834
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

2208
01:33:14,835 --> 01:33:16,377
Well, I...

2209
01:33:16,378 --> 01:33:18,254
Let's put it this way.

2210
01:33:18,255 --> 01:33:19,547
You get a free handgun

2211
01:33:19,548 --> 01:33:21,428
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2212
01:33:21,717 --> 01:33:24,010
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2213
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:26,262
You think about the people
that built this country,

2214
01:33:26,263 --> 01:33:27,764
hardworking people like you.

2215
01:33:27,765 --> 01:33:30,414
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2216
01:33:30,434 --> 01:33:34,187
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2217
01:33:34,188 --> 01:33:36,147
It fucking makes me angry.

2218
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:39,297
Now the one thing about Wall Street
and this market is,

2219
01:33:39,318 --> 01:33:41,091
for me, I feel

2220
01:33:42,029 --> 01:33:44,489
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2221
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:46,741
There are situations where I can

2222
01:33:46,742 --> 01:33:50,370
make those situations better
for people. You know?

2223
01:33:50,371 --> 01:33:51,746
You know what I mean.

2224
01:33:51,747 --> 01:33:53,269
Opportunity

2225
01:33:53,707 --> 01:33:54,791
is everything.

2226
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,144
Exactly.

2227
01:33:56,168 --> 01:33:58,711
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2228
01:33:58,712 --> 01:34:02,549
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2229
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,467
He was bogged down
by student loans.

2230
01:34:04,468 --> 01:34:06,970
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

2231
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:08,721
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2232
01:34:08,722 --> 01:34:09,806
Sure.

2233
01:34:09,807 --> 01:34:10,974
But we got him into the market

2234
01:34:10,975 --> 01:34:12,725
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2235
01:34:12,726 --> 01:34:14,561
We gave him the right guidance.

2236
01:34:14,562 --> 01:34:17,336
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2237
01:34:17,898 --> 01:34:19,482
Got to put his mother into

2238
01:34:19,483 --> 01:34:21,317
the best hospital
in New York City.

2239
01:34:21,318 --> 01:34:22,485
It didn't work out for her,

2240
01:34:22,486 --> 01:34:24,279
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

2241
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,239
But we gave him
that opportunity.

2242
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,512
You know what I'm saying?

2243
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:29,909
It's just about setting
up the right team,

2244
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:32,763
and then overnight
your life can change.

2245
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:40,566
What does...
What does an intern...

2246
01:34:42,006 --> 01:34:43,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does an intern
make in a deal like that?</font>

2247
01:34:43,924 --> 01:34:46,072
Well, <font color="#FFFFFF">in that </font>situation,

2248
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:50,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,</font>

2249
01:34:50,264 --> 01:34:52,913
north <font color="#FFFFFF">of half a million </font>dollars.

2250
01:34:56,437 --> 01:34:58,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,</font>

2251
01:34:58,772 --> 01:35:01,546
anybody<font color="#FFFFFF"> that needs</font>
the proper guidance.

2252
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:23,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you say that again,</font>

2253
01:35:23,714 --> 01:35:25,282
just the<font color="#FFFFFF"> way you said</font> it?

2254
01:35:25,758 --> 01:35:27,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the same way.</font>

2255
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:30,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

2256
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
you're talking about.</font>

2257
01:35:32,806 --> 01:35:34,749
Oh, come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

2258
01:35:35,476 --> 01:35:37,249
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

2259
01:35:37,269 --> 01:35:38,478
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2260
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:40,688
You just tried to
bribe a federal officer.

2261
01:35:40,689 --> 01:35:42,857
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

2262
01:35:42,858 --> 01:35:45,360
No, no, that's not the conversation
I heard, Jordan.

2263
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:46,945
No, no, according to
the U.S. criminal code,

2264
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,863
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

2265
01:35:48,864 --> 01:35:50,448
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

2266
01:35:50,449 --> 01:35:52,158
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

2267
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,910
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2268
01:35:53,911 --> 01:35:56,663
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2269
01:35:56,664 --> 01:35:57,789
Yeah.

2270
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,374
The same gentleman that told me

2271
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,209
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2272
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:03,438
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2273
01:36:03,462 --> 01:36:05,004
He ran a security check on me.

2274
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:06,231
Well...

2275
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,384
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2276
01:36:09,385 --> 01:36:11,613
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2277
01:36:12,846 --> 01:36:14,847
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2278
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,916
What do you say? Hmm?

2279
01:36:17,226 --> 01:36:18,518
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2280
01:36:18,519 --> 01:36:21,623
Most of the Wall Street jackasses
that I bust,

2281
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:24,399
they're to the manor born.

2282
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,566
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2283
01:36:25,567 --> 01:36:27,277
Their fathers are douchebags,

2284
01:36:27,278 --> 01:36:29,301
just like their
fathers before them.

2285
01:36:30,322 --> 01:36:31,799
But you...

2286
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:35,848
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2287
01:36:35,911 --> 01:36:37,137
Did I?

2288
01:36:37,162 --> 01:36:39,310
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2289
01:36:39,373 --> 01:36:40,707
Good for you.

2290
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:41,958
Me, the little man?

2291
01:36:41,959 --> 01:36:43,084
And let me tell you something.

2292
01:36:43,085 --> 01:36:45,153
Let me tell you something else.

2293
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:47,380
Honestly,
I'm not bullshitting here,

2294
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:48,548
this is one of the nicest boats

2295
01:36:48,549 --> 01:36:50,675
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2296
01:36:50,676 --> 01:36:52,356
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2297
01:36:52,594 --> 01:36:55,596
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office

2298
01:36:55,597 --> 01:36:57,870
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2299
01:36:57,891 --> 01:37:00,143
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2300
01:37:00,144 --> 01:37:01,811
look at this thing!

2301
01:37:01,812 --> 01:37:02,895
It's beautiful!

2302
01:37:02,896 --> 01:37:05,982
And you got the beautiful
girls there. It's wonderful.

2303
01:37:05,983 --> 01:37:08,506
All right, get the
fuck off my boat.

2304
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:10,236
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other

2305
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:11,362
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2306
01:37:11,363 --> 01:37:12,905
Good luck on that
subway ride home

2307
01:37:12,906 --> 01:37:14,907
to your miserable,
ugly fucking wives.

2308
01:37:14,908 --> 01:37:18,077
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some
caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2309
01:37:18,078 --> 01:37:20,830
Hey, you guys want to take some
lobsters for your ride home?

2310
01:37:20,831 --> 01:37:23,541
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2311
01:37:23,542 --> 01:37:25,440
Fucking cheap fucks.

2312
01:37:25,753 --> 01:37:28,026
Fucking miserable pricks.

2313
01:37:28,088 --> 01:37:31,341
Hey, fellas! Look what I
found in my pocket! Look!

2314
01:37:31,342 --> 01:37:33,176
A year's salary right here.

2315
01:37:33,177 --> 01:37:35,928
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2316
01:37:35,929 --> 01:37:37,281
See that!

2317
01:37:37,723 --> 01:37:39,825
They're fun coupons!

2318
01:37:47,566 --> 01:37:50,385
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2319
01:37:50,402 --> 01:37:52,487
<i>Swiss fucking banks,
that's what.</i>

2320
01:37:52,488 --> 01:37:55,262
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2321
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,052
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2322
01:37:58,118 --> 01:37:59,786
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2323
01:37:59,787 --> 01:38:00,953
That's for European pussy!

2324
01:38:00,954 --> 01:38:02,288
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2325
01:38:02,289 --> 01:38:04,733
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2326
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,211
<i>So I knew if I took
my drugs right,</i>

2327
01:38:08,212 --> 01:38:10,360
<i>I could sleep through
the entire flight.</i>

2328
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:13,116
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2329
01:38:13,634 --> 01:38:15,736
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped
a few more ludes,</i>

2330
01:38:15,761 --> 01:38:17,303
<i>which started kicking
in by the time.</i>

2331
01:38:17,304 --> 01:38:19,156
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2332
01:38:19,306 --> 01:38:20,623
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2333
01:38:20,808 --> 01:38:22,600
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2334
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:25,625
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2335
01:38:25,687 --> 01:38:27,255
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2336
01:38:29,316 --> 01:38:31,760
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2337
01:38:31,902 --> 01:38:34,596
<i>and pretty much lost
all my motor skills.</i>

2338
01:38:34,738 --> 01:38:36,340
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2339
01:38:39,284 --> 01:38:42,745
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2340
01:38:42,746 --> 01:38:44,439
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2341
01:38:45,249 --> 01:38:47,291
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2342
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:49,085
Wow! Look at you!

2343
01:38:49,086 --> 01:38:51,154
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2344
01:38:51,255 --> 01:38:53,506
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2345
01:38:53,507 --> 01:38:55,133
May I see your
boarding passes, sir?

2346
01:38:55,134 --> 01:38:56,952
We have the boarding passes.

2347
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:59,112
Jesus Christ,
I wanna fuck her.

2348
01:38:59,638 --> 01:39:01,456
Hey! Fucking relax.

2349
01:39:01,515 --> 01:39:03,683
Oh, my God! You got your
hand on my fucking cock!

2350
01:39:03,684 --> 01:39:05,143
I don't. Cut it out.

2351
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:06,185
He's got his hand
on my dick again.

2352
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:07,311
I'm just trying
to buckle you up.

2353
01:39:07,312 --> 01:39:08,604
You got your hand on his dick?

2354
01:39:08,605 --> 01:39:10,628
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2355
01:39:10,649 --> 01:39:12,717
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2356
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:13,985
Take it off!

2357
01:39:13,986 --> 01:39:17,056
I heard there's a treasure map
under here.

2358
01:39:17,448 --> 01:39:19,449
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2359
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:20,972
Please sit down.

2360
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,535
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2361
01:39:22,536 --> 01:39:24,934
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2362
01:39:25,289 --> 01:39:26,873
I will have to call the captain.

2363
01:39:26,874 --> 01:39:29,500
Please, sir, please, sir.
Sit down.

2364
01:39:29,501 --> 01:39:31,252
- Please sit down!
- Ow!

2365
01:39:31,253 --> 01:39:32,879
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2366
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,573
We apologize.
We're gonna go to sleep.

2367
01:39:34,756 --> 01:39:36,073
Question. I wanna
ask you a question.

2368
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:37,488
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2369
01:39:38,093 --> 01:39:39,719
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2370
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,845
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2371
01:39:40,846 --> 01:39:42,054
Sit down. Fasten it.

2372
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:43,639
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2373
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,724
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2374
01:39:44,725 --> 01:39:45,975
You gotta speak English.

2375
01:39:45,976 --> 01:39:48,019
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2376
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,622
I will help him
with his seat belt.

2377
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:52,892
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2378
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,984
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2379
01:39:57,237 --> 01:39:59,010
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2380
01:40:14,213 --> 01:40:15,588
Jesus Christ!

2381
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:17,066
Fuck!

2382
01:40:18,634 --> 01:40:20,092
Donnie...

2383
01:40:20,093 --> 01:40:23,322
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2384
01:40:23,847 --> 01:40:25,640
I can't untie you.

2385
01:40:25,641 --> 01:40:27,016
The captain tied you up.

2386
01:40:27,017 --> 01:40:28,585
He almost fucking tasered you.

2387
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:30,583
Why?

2388
01:40:30,812 --> 01:40:31,959
Why?

2389
01:40:33,565 --> 01:40:34,882
He's got a fear of flying.

2390
01:40:36,068 --> 01:40:37,545
Ah!

2391
01:40:39,196 --> 01:40:40,780
He's very nervous
on planes, I'm sorry,

2392
01:40:40,781 --> 01:40:42,804
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2393
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:45,803
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2394
01:40:46,119 --> 01:40:48,120
You were screaming at people.

2395
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:49,580
Oh, fuck off.

2396
01:40:49,581 --> 01:40:51,791
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2397
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:52,917
Oh, Jesus.

2398
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:55,086
You called the
captain the N-word.

2399
01:40:55,087 --> 01:40:56,671
I called the captain the N-word?

2400
01:40:56,672 --> 01:40:59,195
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2401
01:40:59,299 --> 01:41:01,743
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2402
01:41:02,177 --> 01:41:05,406
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2403
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:07,953
Where are the ludes?

2404
01:41:07,975 --> 01:41:09,076
Where are the ludes?

2405
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:11,602
They're up my ass.
Don't worry about it.

2406
01:41:11,603 --> 01:41:13,312
- I got it.
-  Okay.

2407
01:41:13,313 --> 01:41:15,006
Thank God.

2408
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,774
Jesus Christ, what
are we gonna do

2409
01:41:16,775 --> 01:41:17,900
when we get to
Switzerland, buddy?

2410
01:41:17,901 --> 01:41:18,985
This is bad.

2411
01:41:18,986 --> 01:41:20,987
Fucking things are against my
chest. I can't breathe.

2412
01:41:20,988 --> 01:41:22,697
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2413
01:41:22,698 --> 01:41:24,532
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

2414
01:41:25,784 --> 01:41:26,976
Okay. Shh! Shh!

2415
01:41:28,078 --> 01:41:29,161
That's good.

2416
01:41:29,162 --> 01:41:30,955
- Go to sleep.
- Rub it harder, buddy.

2417
01:41:30,956 --> 01:41:32,649
You're all right.

2418
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,231
We all love you.
Shut the fuck up!

2419
01:41:40,966 --> 01:41:42,318
Mr. Belfort,

2420
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:43,948
you're free to go.

2421
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:47,118
Really?

2422
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,183
Whoo!

2423
01:41:51,184 --> 01:41:52,393
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2424
01:41:52,394 --> 01:41:54,186
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2425
01:41:54,187 --> 01:41:56,355
Okay? Let's make Geneva an
asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2426
01:41:56,356 --> 01:41:57,815
What are you
fucking coming at me for?

2427
01:41:57,816 --> 01:41:59,442
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2428
01:41:59,443 --> 01:42:01,068
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2429
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:02,153
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2430
01:42:03,322 --> 01:42:05,845
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2431
01:42:06,283 --> 01:42:07,805
Jordan Belfort!

2432
01:42:07,951 --> 01:42:09,035
At last.

2433
01:42:09,036 --> 01:42:11,764
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2434
01:42:11,872 --> 01:42:13,849
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2435
01:42:13,874 --> 01:42:16,115
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2436
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:18,169
It's a joke.

2437
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:20,523
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2438
01:42:20,797 --> 01:42:22,298
You need a bigger couch.
For guests.

2439
01:42:22,299 --> 01:42:24,258
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2440
01:42:24,259 --> 01:42:27,203
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2441
01:42:28,722 --> 01:42:31,996
Uh... Wait. Yes.
Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2442
01:42:32,476 --> 01:42:35,625
Swiss custom requires
10 minutes of...

2443
01:42:35,646 --> 01:42:36,729
Blah, blah, blah.

2444
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,439
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2445
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,167
Before business can be discussed.

2446
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,836
Yeah.

2447
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,677
Of course.

2448
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,139
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2449
01:42:50,577 --> 01:42:53,537
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2450
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:55,811
to cooperate with an FBI

2451
01:42:56,083 --> 01:42:59,278
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2452
01:42:59,795 --> 01:43:01,067
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2453
01:43:01,588 --> 01:43:02,860
<i>Ca depend?</i>

2454
01:43:03,382 --> 01:43:04,483
<i>Oui.</i>

2455
01:43:04,883 --> 01:43:07,657
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2456
01:43:08,345 --> 01:43:10,680
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2457
01:43:10,681 --> 01:43:12,624
in the coming months.

2458
01:43:12,724 --> 01:43:15,017
Shall I check if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2459
01:43:15,018 --> 01:43:17,212
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2460
01:43:17,729 --> 01:43:20,231
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.
It's Croix.

2461
01:43:20,232 --> 01:43:22,525
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2462
01:43:22,526 --> 01:43:24,360
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2463
01:43:24,361 --> 01:43:26,338
Yeah, yeah. French
fries, pommes frites.

2464
01:43:27,489 --> 01:43:30,138
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2465
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:34,203
<i>What I'm asking,
you Swiss dick,</i>

2466
01:43:34,204 --> 01:43:36,602
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2467
01:43:39,126 --> 01:43:42,901
<i>I understand
perfectly, you American shit.</i>

2468
01:43:44,965 --> 01:43:47,425
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

2469
01:43:47,426 --> 01:43:49,620
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2470
01:43:49,636 --> 01:43:51,595
is if the crime being pursued

2471
01:43:51,596 --> 01:43:53,869
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2472
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:58,477
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2473
01:43:58,478 --> 01:43:59,645
Hmm.

2474
01:43:59,646 --> 01:44:01,355
From a financial standpoint,

2475
01:44:01,356 --> 01:44:02,799
you are now

2476
01:44:03,108 --> 01:44:04,551
in heaven.

2477
01:44:04,609 --> 01:44:06,586
See, I told you he was
fantastic, right?

2478
01:44:07,237 --> 01:44:11,888
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2479
01:44:12,242 --> 01:44:13,719
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2480
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:16,245
We would wipe our ass with it.

2481
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:20,332
Unless, of course, it
was an investigation

2482
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:22,251
into stock fraud,

2483
01:44:22,252 --> 01:44:24,503
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2484
01:44:24,504 --> 01:44:28,609
<i>Then there would have to
be coopération on your part,</i>

2485
01:44:28,633 --> 01:44:30,280
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2486
01:44:30,761 --> 01:44:33,284
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.

2487
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:35,824
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2488
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:38,702
If it were

2489
01:44:38,852 --> 01:44:40,249
another name,

2490
01:44:41,354 --> 01:44:43,189
a friend's, camarade...

2491
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:44,416
Cousin?

2492
01:44:48,904 --> 01:44:50,722
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2493
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:52,465
Hmm.

2494
01:44:52,824 --> 01:44:55,552
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

2495
01:44:55,577 --> 01:44:58,120
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2496
01:44:58,121 --> 01:44:59,973
Yes. Yes.

2497
01:45:00,624 --> 01:45:03,273
<i>He's telling me
to use a fucking rathole.</i>

2498
01:45:03,376 --> 01:45:05,127
<i>But a U.S. rathole
would never get</i>

2499
01:45:05,128 --> 01:45:07,421
<i>into Switzerland
with all that money.</i>

2500
01:45:07,422 --> 01:45:11,368
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

2501
01:45:18,558 --> 01:45:20,059
Jordan.

2502
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,020
Hey. How's my
favorite aunt, huh?

2503
01:45:23,021 --> 01:45:24,522
Welcome.
Was the traffic terrible?

2504
01:45:24,523 --> 01:45:26,170
Oh, no, not at all.

2505
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,337
Jordan, come in.

2506
01:45:30,403 --> 01:45:33,006
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.</i>

2507
01:45:33,573 --> 01:45:36,176
<i>Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.</i>

2508
01:45:36,243 --> 01:45:38,721
<i>Money talks and
bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2509
01:45:39,204 --> 01:45:41,227
<i>How do you say
"rathole" in British?</i>

2510
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:44,083
If you get into any
trouble whatsoever,

2511
01:45:44,084 --> 01:45:46,919
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2512
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,317
That I promise.

2513
01:45:48,922 --> 01:45:51,650
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2514
01:45:55,929 --> 01:45:57,827
Sometimes I wonder

2515
01:45:58,098 --> 01:46:01,141
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

2516
01:46:01,142 --> 01:46:02,368
Among

2517
01:46:02,727 --> 01:46:04,374
other substances.

2518
01:46:04,771 --> 01:46:06,873
Oh.

2519
01:46:08,692 --> 01:46:10,150
It's that obvious, huh?

2520
01:46:10,151 --> 01:46:13,505
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2521
01:46:16,116 --> 01:46:18,059
What can I say?
I'm...

2522
01:46:18,827 --> 01:46:20,600
I'm a drug addict.

2523
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,063
I really am.

2524
01:46:22,998 --> 01:46:24,850
Cocaine, pills.

2525
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,773
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2526
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:30,004
Now that's the truth.

2527
01:46:30,005 --> 01:46:31,338
I mean...

2528
01:46:31,339 --> 01:46:32,816
I'm a sex addict, too.

2529
01:46:33,633 --> 01:46:36,135
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2530
01:46:37,345 --> 01:46:39,805
Jesus, why am I telling
you all this? Why am I...

2531
01:46:39,806 --> 01:46:41,533
I'm sorry.

2532
01:46:42,183 --> 01:46:44,502
Because I'm very
easy to talk to.

2533
01:46:44,769 --> 01:46:47,588
- You are. You are easy to talk to.
- Mmm.

2534
01:46:48,648 --> 01:46:50,149
I suppose it's...

2535
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,672
Just my job, you know.

2536
01:46:52,736 --> 01:46:54,570
All these people
dependent on me.

2537
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:57,470
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2538
01:46:57,657 --> 01:46:59,450
Sometimes I feel like I...

2539
01:46:59,451 --> 01:47:02,725
I've bitten off more
than I can chew, you know.

2540
01:47:02,829 --> 01:47:04,931
You're a man with
large appetites.

2541
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:06,482
Yeah.

2542
01:47:08,084 --> 01:47:10,107
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2543
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:11,484
Yeah.

2544
01:47:11,504 --> 01:47:12,901
Yeah, I am.

2545
01:47:15,175 --> 01:47:18,324
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2546
01:47:18,845 --> 01:47:20,492
My decision.

2547
01:47:20,889 --> 01:47:22,431
It's just hard to...

2548
01:47:22,432 --> 01:47:26,457
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2549
01:47:26,937 --> 01:47:28,584
You know, to...

2550
01:47:28,855 --> 01:47:31,674
Learn to relax and let go and...

2551
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:34,461
To release the tension.

2552
01:47:35,403 --> 01:47:36,971
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2553
01:47:37,822 --> 01:47:39,344
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2554
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:41,805
Yeah, to release the tension.

2555
01:47:45,622 --> 01:47:47,474
I suppose we, uh...

2556
01:47:47,916 --> 01:47:50,360
We all just need to learn, uh...

2557
01:47:50,877 --> 01:47:54,277
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2558
01:47:56,091 --> 01:47:58,660
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2559
01:48:04,766 --> 01:48:06,517
Stability, dear.

2560
01:48:06,518 --> 01:48:08,040
Family.

2561
01:48:14,693 --> 01:48:16,841
You take care of
my niece, my love.

2562
01:48:17,028 --> 01:48:19,301
I'll take care of
everything over here.

2563
01:48:20,323 --> 01:48:21,424
Deal.

2564
01:48:23,952 --> 01:48:26,646
Come on! There you go.

2565
01:48:26,705 --> 01:48:28,022
Whoo!

2566
01:48:28,164 --> 01:48:31,518
<i>We had, literally,
a fuckload of money.</i>

2567
01:48:31,918 --> 01:48:34,020
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

2568
01:48:34,754 --> 01:48:38,529
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2569
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:40,592
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2570
01:48:40,593 --> 01:48:43,470
<i>Now Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,</i>

2571
01:48:43,471 --> 01:48:45,764
<i>spent his winters in
the south of France,</i>

2572
01:48:45,765 --> 01:48:47,891
<i>which is where he met
his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2573
01:48:47,892 --> 01:48:50,871
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2574
01:48:50,937 --> 01:48:52,459
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2575
01:48:52,939 --> 01:48:54,541
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2576
01:48:58,611 --> 01:49:00,384
Well, this is fucked.

2577
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:02,507
Oh. No shit.

2578
01:49:06,286 --> 01:49:09,014
Like, this will take
her like 50 trips.

2579
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:10,265
I know.

2580
01:49:13,752 --> 01:49:15,069
Let me ask you something?

2581
01:49:15,086 --> 01:49:17,755
What about her family? Right?

2582
01:49:17,756 --> 01:49:20,507
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, fight.

2583
01:49:20,508 --> 01:49:22,468
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2584
01:49:22,469 --> 01:49:24,470
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2585
01:49:24,471 --> 01:49:26,472
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2586
01:49:26,473 --> 01:49:28,140
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2587
01:49:28,141 --> 01:49:29,475
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2588
01:49:29,476 --> 01:49:32,019
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2589
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,964
Hey, uh, don't forget
about my money.

2590
01:49:36,649 --> 01:49:37,816
I'm sorry, what's that?

2591
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:39,359
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2592
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,508
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2593
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:44,073
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2594
01:49:44,074 --> 01:49:46,768
When it gets in, I'll give you
a call, you come pick it up.

2595
01:49:49,287 --> 01:49:50,809
You give me a call?

2596
01:49:52,332 --> 01:49:55,667
When it gets here, I'll give you a
call and you'll come pick it up.

2597
01:49:55,668 --> 01:49:57,441
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2598
01:49:57,462 --> 01:49:58,984
Sweetheart,

2599
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:01,048
you have my money
taped to your tits.

2600
01:50:01,049 --> 01:50:03,151
Okay? Technically,
you do work for me.

2601
01:50:06,096 --> 01:50:07,789
Hey, Jordan,
we're gonna need to talk.

2602
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:09,515
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2603
01:50:09,516 --> 01:50:10,557
I ain't going to him, okay.

2604
01:50:10,558 --> 01:50:11,683
<i>- I'm not a fucking shvartze.
- I got it.</i>

2605
01:50:11,684 --> 01:50:13,060
I don't do fucking
pickups, all right?

2606
01:50:13,061 --> 01:50:14,186
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2607
01:50:14,187 --> 01:50:15,854
We meet someplace
that I fucking say.

2608
01:50:15,855 --> 01:50:17,314
And you tell that
fucking piece of shit,

2609
01:50:17,315 --> 01:50:18,565
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2610
01:50:18,566 --> 01:50:20,943
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2611
01:50:20,944 --> 01:50:22,861
I'll mash that
douchebag's teeth in.

2612
01:50:22,862 --> 01:50:24,696
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2613
01:50:24,697 --> 01:50:26,490
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2614
01:50:26,491 --> 01:50:28,867
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2615
01:50:28,868 --> 01:50:30,786
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2616
01:50:30,787 --> 01:50:32,871
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2617
01:50:32,872 --> 01:50:34,164
I put that money in there!

2618
01:50:34,165 --> 01:50:35,791
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2619
01:50:35,792 --> 01:50:38,168
I got five more just like you, bro.

2620
01:50:38,169 --> 01:50:39,962
Keep talking,
you fucking piece of shit!

2621
01:50:39,963 --> 01:50:41,797
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2622
01:50:41,798 --> 01:50:42,881
So fuck you!

2623
01:50:42,882 --> 01:50:44,716
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2624
01:50:44,717 --> 01:50:46,819
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2625
01:50:47,053 --> 01:50:48,655
You okay? Hey, pal.

2626
01:50:51,182 --> 01:50:54,059
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2627
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,478
<i>Two million in cash
in her carry-on,</i>

2628
01:50:56,479 --> 01:50:57,896
<i>which in the big picture</i>

2629
01:50:57,897 --> 01:50:59,624
<i>was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2630
01:51:00,692 --> 01:51:02,067
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2631
01:51:02,068 --> 01:51:04,027
<i>over the course of
six round trips,</i>

2632
01:51:04,028 --> 01:51:05,737
<i>Chantalle's family and friends</i>

2633
01:51:05,738 --> 01:51:08,157
<i>smuggled in over
20 million in cash</i>

2634
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:10,010
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2635
01:51:14,914 --> 01:51:16,915
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2636
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:18,208
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2637
01:51:18,209 --> 01:51:19,418
<i>And here.</i>

2638
01:51:19,419 --> 01:51:20,711
Welcome.

2639
01:51:20,712 --> 01:51:21,879
<i>Welcome.</i>

2640
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,173
- Yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh!

2641
01:51:25,383 --> 01:51:27,801
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2642
01:51:27,802 --> 01:51:29,428
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2643
01:51:29,429 --> 01:51:30,804
Who cares. You're blonde.

2644
01:51:30,805 --> 01:51:31,906
Oh, stop.

2645
01:51:52,577 --> 01:51:53,785
Shit.

2646
01:51:53,786 --> 01:51:57,019
Just put the fucking car in
park, you dumb fucking idiot!

2647
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,167
I can't close this briefcase.

2648
01:52:00,168 --> 01:52:01,627
One fucking day.

2649
01:52:01,628 --> 01:52:03,670
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2650
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:05,364
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2651
01:52:05,798 --> 01:52:08,526
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2652
01:52:13,264 --> 01:52:14,848
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2653
01:52:14,849 --> 01:52:16,892
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2654
01:52:16,893 --> 01:52:17,976
It's a fucking joke.

2655
01:52:17,977 --> 01:52:19,645
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2656
01:52:19,646 --> 01:52:21,188
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2657
01:52:21,189 --> 01:52:23,106
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2658
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:25,859
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2659
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:28,028
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2660
01:52:28,029 --> 01:52:30,489
With smart important
people, unlike you.

2661
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:32,866
People who don't
sucker-punch people

2662
01:52:32,867 --> 01:52:34,451
when they're scared. Okay?

2663
01:52:34,452 --> 01:52:35,911
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2664
01:52:35,912 --> 01:52:36,995
I haven't gotten an
apology yet for that.

2665
01:52:36,996 --> 01:52:38,121
You want an apology, okay.

2666
01:52:38,122 --> 01:52:39,665
I check my fucking
messages every day

2667
01:52:39,666 --> 01:52:40,749
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2668
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,000
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2669
01:52:42,001 --> 01:52:43,126
I got a blinking light,

2670
01:52:43,127 --> 01:52:44,503
because I don't
have shit from you.

2671
01:52:44,504 --> 01:52:45,796
You know what,
you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2672
01:52:45,797 --> 01:52:47,130
I got my wife
checking the messages

2673
01:52:47,131 --> 01:52:49,216
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2674
01:52:49,217 --> 01:52:50,509
"Has Brad apologized yet?"

2675
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,594
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2676
01:52:52,595 --> 01:52:54,221
I don't have jack shit.
You know what?

2677
01:52:54,222 --> 01:52:55,722
That's not how you treat people.

2678
01:52:55,723 --> 01:52:56,848
You got a big fucking
mouth, you know.

2679
01:52:56,849 --> 01:52:58,600
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2680
01:52:58,601 --> 01:53:00,894
You're gonna
give me a pass?

2681
01:53:00,895 --> 01:53:02,562
Look, it's a figure
of fucking speech.

2682
01:53:02,563 --> 01:53:04,606
Oh, my gosh.
The Emperor of Fucksville

2683
01:53:04,607 --> 01:53:05,983
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2684
01:53:05,984 --> 01:53:07,067
From Fucksville, huh?

2685
01:53:07,068 --> 01:53:09,027
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2686
01:53:09,028 --> 01:53:10,570
when their Emperor's gone?

2687
01:53:10,571 --> 01:53:12,197
Is it mayhem?

2688
01:53:12,198 --> 01:53:14,074
Are people looting and raping?

2689
01:53:14,075 --> 01:53:16,159
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2690
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,661
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2691
01:53:17,662 --> 01:53:19,037
You back the fuck up.

2692
01:53:19,038 --> 01:53:20,289
I'll cause the biggest
fucking scene

2693
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,582
that I've ever caused in my life

2694
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:24,418
if you come at me again.

2695
01:53:24,419 --> 01:53:26,086
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2696
01:53:26,087 --> 01:53:27,379
I got...

2697
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,964
I don't wanna be out
of line or anything,

2698
01:53:28,965 --> 01:53:32,050
but I think you like,
like me. Like you...

2699
01:53:32,051 --> 01:53:33,593
Like when you come at me...

2700
01:53:33,594 --> 01:53:34,761
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2701
01:53:34,762 --> 01:53:36,263
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2702
01:53:36,264 --> 01:53:38,056
You have like a fucking, like...

2703
01:53:38,057 --> 01:53:40,142
Like a twinkle.
You have like a twinkle.

2704
01:53:40,143 --> 01:53:41,685
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2705
01:53:41,686 --> 01:53:43,353
Jesus fucking Christ.

2706
01:53:43,354 --> 01:53:45,397
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2707
01:53:45,398 --> 01:53:47,190
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2708
01:53:47,191 --> 01:53:48,984
You're just not the
one for me, pal.

2709
01:53:48,985 --> 01:53:50,193
You know what I mean?
It's not...

2710
01:53:50,194 --> 01:53:52,195
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2711
01:53:52,196 --> 01:53:54,698
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2712
01:53:54,699 --> 01:53:56,158
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2713
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,617
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2714
01:53:57,618 --> 01:53:59,369
You gotta take this case,

2715
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:00,996
you gotta drive straight home,

2716
01:54:00,997 --> 01:54:02,664
need you to open
up the briefcase,

2717
01:54:02,665 --> 01:54:04,583
and you take out
every single dollar.

2718
01:54:04,584 --> 01:54:06,626
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2719
01:54:06,627 --> 01:54:07,836
And once you have it all

2720
01:54:07,837 --> 01:54:09,713
neatly organized
outside the briefcase,

2721
01:54:09,714 --> 01:54:12,090
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2722
01:54:12,091 --> 01:54:14,259
your wife's Latvian
cunt, you understand?

2723
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:16,011
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2724
01:54:16,012 --> 01:54:17,554
Fuck. You motherfucking
piece of shit!

2725
01:54:17,555 --> 01:54:18,764
How about now?

2726
01:54:18,765 --> 01:54:20,223
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2727
01:54:21,893 --> 01:54:23,685
Motherfuck!
You're fucking dead!

2728
01:54:23,686 --> 01:54:25,437
Stop! Don't move!
Don't move!

2729
01:54:25,438 --> 01:54:28,382
Stop, or I will blow
you the fuck away!

2730
01:54:28,691 --> 01:54:30,942
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2731
01:54:30,943 --> 01:54:32,861
Get down.

2732
01:54:32,862 --> 01:54:34,714
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2733
01:54:35,323 --> 01:54:36,845
Motherfucker!

2734
01:54:38,785 --> 01:54:39,932
Motherfucker!

2735
01:54:48,628 --> 01:54:52,297
Jordan, do I have a
surprise for you!

2736
01:54:52,298 --> 01:54:53,507
What's that?

2737
01:54:53,508 --> 01:54:55,133
Twenty real Lemmons.

2738
01:54:55,134 --> 01:54:56,385
Retired pharmacist's
client of mine,

2739
01:54:56,386 --> 01:54:57,636
they've been in the
safe for 15 years.

2740
01:54:57,637 --> 01:54:59,137
Are you fucking kidding me?
Lemmons?

2741
01:54:59,138 --> 01:55:00,347
Ha-ha!

2742
01:55:00,348 --> 01:55:02,307
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2743
01:55:02,308 --> 01:55:04,101
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i>

2744
01:55:04,102 --> 01:55:07,312
<i>the Lemmon 714 was
the Holy Grail.</i>

2745
01:55:07,313 --> 01:55:08,897
- <font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.</font>

2746
01:55:08,898 --> 01:55:10,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought they were like a</font> myth.

2748
01:55:12,402 --> 01:55:13,527

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Boy, Donnie really knew

2751
01:55:18,366 --> 01:55:21,034

01:55:33,881 --> 01:55:35,779
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2757
01:55:36,259 --> 01:55:37,509
Okay.

2758
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,094
Start off with one,
see how it goes?

2759
01:55:39,095 --> 01:55:40,929
My guy says all
we'll need is one.

2760
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,452
Here you go.

2761
01:55:43,057 --> 01:55:44,808
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2762
01:55:44,809 --> 01:55:47,708
<i>Maybe if I pull it
again, it'll go down.</i>

2763
01:55:49,355 --> 01:55:50,689
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2764
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:52,023
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2765
01:55:52,024 --> 01:55:53,984
<i>Carl, I think I got
it figured out.</i>

2766
01:55:53,985 --> 01:55:57,779
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2767
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,132
<i>Okay.</i>

2768
01:56:07,373 --> 01:56:09,271
Do you feel anything?

2769
01:56:11,836 --> 01:56:13,108
No.

2770
01:56:15,715 --> 01:56:17,632
It's been 35 minutes.

2771
01:56:17,633 --> 01:56:18,859
Hmm.

2772
01:56:20,052 --> 01:56:21,553
Maybe we've built up a tolerance

2773
01:56:21,554 --> 01:56:23,702
after all these years, huh?

2774
01:56:25,516 --> 01:56:26,742
Hmm.

2775
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,236
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2776
01:56:38,237 --> 01:56:41,490
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2777
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:42,741
They're old.

2778
01:56:42,742 --> 01:56:44,993
You think they lost
their potency, huh?

2779
01:56:44,994 --> 01:56:46,721
Check the bottle!

2780
01:56:49,457 --> 01:56:50,957
January '81.

2781
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,125
They're fucking duds.

2782
01:56:52,126 --> 01:56:53,251
Fuck!

2783
01:56:53,252 --> 01:56:54,419
Let's take, uh...

2784
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,022
Let's take two more each.

2785
01:56:57,882 --> 01:57:00,531
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2786
01:57:04,096 --> 01:57:05,889
What are you two retards doing?

2787
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,207
We're working out, honey.

2788
01:57:07,433 --> 01:57:09,100
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2789
01:57:09,101 --> 01:57:10,185
Okay.

2790
01:57:10,186 --> 01:57:12,209
- Okay?
- Okay.

2791
01:57:13,606 --> 01:57:15,232
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2792
01:57:15,233 --> 01:57:16,441
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2793
01:57:16,442 --> 01:57:17,901
I cannot talk to
you on this phone,

2794
01:57:17,902 --> 01:57:19,110
I have to talk to you.

2795
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:20,695
<i>Get out of here.
What's going on?</i>

2796
01:57:20,696 --> 01:57:24,115
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2797
01:57:24,116 --> 01:57:25,867
and then call me
from a pay phone.

2798
01:57:25,868 --> 01:57:27,911
This is not a fucking
joke, Jordan.

2799
01:57:27,912 --> 01:57:29,639
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2800
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:31,456
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2801
01:57:31,457 --> 01:57:32,916
I don't know what the
fuck's going on.

2802
01:57:32,917 --> 01:57:34,985
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2803
01:57:45,304 --> 01:57:47,138
<i>The closest pay
phone I could get to</i>

2804
01:57:47,139 --> 01:57:49,537
<i>was at the Brookville
Country Club.</i>

2805
01:57:50,101 --> 01:57:52,143
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2806
01:57:52,144 --> 01:57:54,838
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2807
01:58:04,198 --> 01:58:05,699
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2808
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,825
I'm at a pay phone.
What's going on?

2809
01:58:06,826 --> 01:58:08,034
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2810
01:58:08,035 --> 01:58:09,911
Please. Your little
friend there, Brad,

2811
01:58:09,912 --> 01:58:11,889
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2812
01:58:12,456 --> 01:58:13,832
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2813
01:58:13,833 --> 01:58:15,375
<i>- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.</i>

2814
01:58:15,376 --> 01:58:16,793
My friends in Long
Island told me

2815
01:58:16,794 --> 01:58:19,087
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2816
01:58:19,088 --> 01:58:20,171
He got locked up by...

2817
01:58:20,172 --> 01:58:22,507
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2818
01:58:22,508 --> 01:58:23,883
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2819
01:58:23,884 --> 01:58:25,468
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2820
01:58:25,469 --> 01:58:26,970
<i>- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
- Listen to me!</i>

2821
01:58:26,971 --> 01:58:28,013
I gotta go fucking
talk to him right now!

2822
01:58:28,014 --> 01:58:30,056
Listen to me! Don't go!
Listen to me.

2823
01:58:30,057 --> 01:58:32,767
That guy Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

2824
01:58:32,768 --> 01:58:35,145
somebody told me he's got
your phones tapped.

2825
01:58:35,146 --> 01:58:36,730
Your office and your home.

2826
01:58:36,731 --> 01:58:38,523
<i>Don't talk on the
motherfucking phone!</i>

2827
01:58:38,524 --> 01:58:40,547
Okay. Fuck! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

2828
01:58:40,901 --> 01:58:42,127
<i>Jordan.</i>

2829
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:46,448
You didn't try to bribe this
fucking FBI agent, did you?

2830
01:58:46,449 --> 01:58:48,575
No, I didn't try to
bribe an FBI agent.

2831
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:50,201
You think I'm that fucking stupid?
No.

2832
01:58:50,202 --> 01:58:52,162
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2833
01:58:52,163 --> 01:58:53,413
<i>Say that again.</i>

2834
01:58:53,414 --> 01:58:56,313
I said...

2835
01:58:56,876 --> 01:58:58,293
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2836
01:58:59,378 --> 01:59:00,462
I said...

2837
01:59:00,463 --> 01:59:02,005
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2838
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:07,278
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2839
01:59:08,012 --> 01:59:10,221
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2840
01:59:10,222 --> 01:59:11,931
<i>Don't get behind the
wheel of the car.</i>

2841
01:59:11,932 --> 01:59:13,558
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2842
01:59:13,559 --> 01:59:14,893
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2843
01:59:14,894 --> 01:59:17,228
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2844
01:59:17,229 --> 01:59:20,273
<i>the Lemmons had developed
a delayed fuse.</i>

2845
01:59:20,274 --> 01:59:23,026
<i>It took 90 minutes for these
little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2846
01:59:23,027 --> 01:59:24,444
<i>But once they did...</i>

2847
01:59:24,445 --> 01:59:25,945
<i>Pow!</i>

2848
01:59:25,946 --> 01:59:27,572
<i>I mean, I had skipped
the tingle phase</i>

2849
01:59:27,573 --> 01:59:29,574
<i>and went straight
to the drool phase.</i>

2850
01:59:29,575 --> 01:59:31,618
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2851
01:59:31,619 --> 01:59:33,620
<i>These little bastards
were so strong,</i>

2852
01:59:33,621 --> 01:59:35,747
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2853
01:59:35,748 --> 01:59:37,896
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2854
01:59:40,086 --> 01:59:42,188
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2855
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:48,073
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2856
01:59:48,928 --> 01:59:51,907
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2857
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:56,461
<i>Yes! I can crawl.
I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2858
02:00:28,008 --> 02:00:31,078
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it
look so goddamn easy!</i>

2859
02:00:38,018 --> 02:00:40,478
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2860
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:41,896
<i>Yes!</i>

2861
02:00:41,897 --> 02:00:44,091
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2862
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,673
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

2863
02:01:34,742 --> 02:01:35,968
Ah!

2864
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,412
Ah!

2865
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:10,235
Jordan.

2866
02:02:11,737 --> 02:02:13,180
<i>Jordan.</i>

2867
02:02:13,447 --> 02:02:15,198
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

2868
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:16,741
I'm at a country club!

2869
02:02:16,742 --> 02:02:17,867
<i>What?</i>

2870
02:02:17,868 --> 02:02:20,787
I'm at a country club!

2871
02:02:20,788 --> 02:02:22,205
<i>I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.</i>

2872
02:02:22,206 --> 02:02:23,540
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2873
02:02:23,541 --> 02:02:26,251
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2874
02:02:26,252 --> 02:02:28,211
<i>with some Swiss guy.
I don't know...</i>

2875
02:02:28,212 --> 02:02:29,295
What?

2876
02:02:29,296 --> 02:02:32,366
Get him off the phone!

2877
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:35,426
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2878
02:02:35,427 --> 02:02:36,761
Get him

2879
02:02:36,762 --> 02:02:37,887
off

2880
02:02:37,888 --> 02:02:39,097
the phone!

2881
02:02:39,098 --> 02:02:40,431
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2882
02:02:40,432 --> 02:02:41,850
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2883
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:53,820
<i>I was less
than a mile from home.</i>

2884
02:02:53,821 --> 02:02:56,614
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2885
02:02:56,615 --> 02:02:58,700
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2886
02:02:58,701 --> 02:03:01,224
<i>I was gonna give you 2 million.</i>

2887
02:03:01,287 --> 02:03:03,936
I's gonna be lates.

2888
02:03:04,498 --> 02:03:06,191
You ate 2 million?

2889
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:08,334
Later.

2890
02:03:08,335 --> 02:03:09,544
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2891
02:03:09,545 --> 02:03:11,129
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2892
02:03:12,423 --> 02:03:14,617
Get out of the way, asshole!

2893
02:03:17,177 --> 02:03:18,511
You hate 2 million?

2894
02:03:18,512 --> 02:03:20,114
No, you don't hate
2 million, Donnie.

2895
02:03:22,558 --> 02:03:25,518
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home alive,</i>

2896
02:03:25,519 --> 02:03:27,917
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2897
02:03:37,239 --> 02:03:38,823
Jordan?

2898
02:03:38,824 --> 02:03:41,492
Jesus fucking Christ!

2899
02:03:41,493 --> 02:03:43,077
What did you take?

2900
02:03:43,078 --> 02:03:44,454
What's wrong with you?

2901
02:03:44,455 --> 02:03:45,538
Jor!

2902
02:03:45,539 --> 02:03:47,999
It's fucking good, right?

2903
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,375
Fucked up!

2904
02:03:50,669 --> 02:03:52,612
Get off the phone!

2905
02:03:55,549 --> 02:03:57,842
What the fuck, Jordan?

2906
02:03:57,843 --> 02:03:59,510
Your daughter's in the house!

2907
02:03:59,511 --> 02:04:00,678
I hope you know that!

2908
02:04:00,679 --> 02:04:02,055
Your fucking daughter's
in the house!

2909
02:04:02,056 --> 02:04:04,057
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2910
02:04:04,058 --> 02:04:06,517
Get off the phone!

2911
02:04:07,645 --> 02:04:08,686
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2912
02:04:08,687 --> 02:04:10,460
The FBI!

2913
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,042
Hey!

2914
02:04:13,484 --> 02:04:15,461
I'm on phone!

2915
02:04:15,569 --> 02:04:18,047
Get off the fucking phone!

2916
02:04:19,698 --> 02:04:21,800
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2917
02:04:23,786 --> 02:04:27,015
Come on.
We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

2918
02:04:28,874 --> 02:04:30,066
Ow!

2919
02:04:31,794 --> 02:04:33,378
I'm on the phone!

2920
02:04:33,379 --> 02:04:34,796
On the phone!

2921
02:04:34,797 --> 02:04:36,991
I know what you did,

2922
02:04:37,383 --> 02:04:38,883
you piece of shit!

2923
02:04:38,884 --> 02:04:40,677
What? What?

2924
02:04:40,678 --> 02:04:42,121
Brad!

2925
02:04:42,471 --> 02:04:43,721
Huh?

2926
02:04:43,722 --> 02:04:45,290
Brad!

2927
02:04:45,683 --> 02:04:46,975
Brad!

2928
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,499
You fucking cocksucker!

2929
02:04:53,732 --> 02:04:55,692
What did you do,

2930
02:04:55,693 --> 02:04:57,568
you piece of shit?

2931
02:04:57,569 --> 02:04:59,091
Fuck you!

2932
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:02,615
I wanna fucking kill you!

2933
02:05:02,616 --> 02:05:04,889
I wanna fucking kill you!

2934
02:05:05,744 --> 02:05:07,187
I got you!

2935
02:05:31,645 --> 02:05:33,668
What the fuck happened?

2936
02:05:34,023 --> 02:05:35,356
Oh, shit!

2937
02:05:35,357 --> 02:05:37,334
Jordan? Jordan,
are you all right?

2938
02:05:37,401 --> 02:05:39,094
Donnie? Donnie?

2939
02:05:39,319 --> 02:05:40,486
Donnie?

2940
02:05:40,487 --> 02:05:41,904
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2941
02:05:41,905 --> 02:05:43,781
Oh, fuck,
I don't know what to do.

2942
02:05:43,782 --> 02:05:45,116
Jordan, I don't know
what the fuck to do!

2943
02:05:45,117 --> 02:05:46,764
I can't help him!
Oh, my God. Jordan.

2944
02:05:48,495 --> 02:05:51,122
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2945
02:05:51,123 --> 02:05:52,975
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2946
02:05:53,459 --> 02:05:56,438
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2947
02:05:57,254 --> 02:05:59,652
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2948
02:05:59,965 --> 02:06:01,466
<i>Ah!</i>

2949
02:06:01,467 --> 02:06:02,884
I got you.

2950
02:06:19,693 --> 02:06:20,794
Oh!

2951
02:06:22,154 --> 02:06:23,847
Step aside!

2952
02:06:23,989 --> 02:06:25,466
Oh, God!

2953
02:06:25,824 --> 02:06:27,392
Oh, God!

2954
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:29,511
Move aside, baby.

2955
02:06:36,376 --> 02:06:38,252
Come on! Come on!

2956
02:06:38,253 --> 02:06:39,570
Come on!

2957
02:06:44,009 --> 02:06:46,783
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2958
02:06:47,721 --> 02:06:49,847
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2959
02:06:49,848 --> 02:06:51,621
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2960
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:58,356
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2961
02:06:58,357 --> 02:07:00,358
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2962
02:07:00,359 --> 02:07:01,609
I don't fucking know!

2963
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,402
Just get over here!
Call 911.

2964
02:07:11,411 --> 02:07:12,512
Yeah.

2965
02:07:13,956 --> 02:07:16,400
You all right?
He's all right.

2966
02:07:29,513 --> 02:07:31,707
Mr. Belfort?

2967
02:07:32,558 --> 02:07:34,126
Mr. Belfort?

2968
02:07:36,687 --> 02:07:39,689
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

2969
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:42,293
Sir, we need to ask
you some questions.

2970
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,902
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.

2971
02:07:44,903 --> 02:07:46,070
Come on, get up.

2972
02:07:46,071 --> 02:07:47,764
Get the fuck out of my house.

2973
02:07:49,449 --> 02:07:51,242
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2974
02:07:51,243 --> 02:07:52,827
I been sitting here all night.

2975
02:07:52,828 --> 02:07:54,287
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2976
02:07:54,288 --> 02:07:56,330
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2977
02:07:56,331 --> 02:07:57,498
Where you taking him?

2978
02:07:57,499 --> 02:07:58,583
You ain't got no warrant.

2979
02:07:58,584 --> 02:08:00,224
Just come up in people's
house like that!

2980
02:08:01,086 --> 02:08:03,421
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2981
02:08:03,422 --> 02:08:04,694
Huh?

2982
02:08:04,923 --> 02:08:06,115
Well?

2983
02:08:09,261 --> 02:08:10,783
<i>Wow!</i>

2984
02:08:10,971 --> 02:08:12,869
<i>Maybe I hadn't
made it home okay.</i>

2985
02:08:27,905 --> 02:08:30,383
Get out of the fucking way!

2986
02:08:32,242 --> 02:08:33,594
Fuck!

2987
02:08:39,124 --> 02:08:41,125
Did you drive

2988
02:08:41,126 --> 02:08:42,853
that car tonight?

2989
02:08:43,879 --> 02:08:46,088
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2990
02:08:46,089 --> 02:08:47,965
I'm a family man!

2991
02:08:47,966 --> 02:08:49,800
Family man. Honey!

2992
02:08:49,801 --> 02:08:51,802
<i>It was a miracle
I wasn't killed,</i>

2993
02:08:51,803 --> 02:08:54,931
<i>or that I didn't
kill anybody else.</i>

2994
02:08:54,932 --> 02:08:56,682
<i>The cops took me in
for questioning,</i>

2995
02:08:56,683 --> 02:08:58,142
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2996
02:08:58,143 --> 02:09:00,686
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2997
02:09:00,687 --> 02:09:01,812
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2998
02:09:01,813 --> 02:09:03,981
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2999
02:09:03,982 --> 02:09:06,651
<i>because he wouldn't
rat Donnie out.</i>

3000
02:09:06,652 --> 02:09:07,777
<i>The result,</i>

3001
02:09:07,778 --> 02:09:09,487
<i>I was soot-free.</i>

3002
02:09:09,488 --> 02:09:11,948
<i>But I had eyes on me
like never before.</i>

3003
02:09:11,949 --> 02:09:13,658
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3004
02:09:13,659 --> 02:09:16,661
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

3005
02:09:16,662 --> 02:09:18,329
You know I don't believe
in luck, right?

3006
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,789
But it's time.

3007
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:22,124
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

3008
02:09:22,125 --> 02:09:24,126
before your luck runs out.

3009
02:09:24,127 --> 02:09:25,795
Wave to Daddy.

3010
02:09:25,796 --> 02:09:26,963
Hey.

3011
02:09:26,964 --> 02:09:28,566
Hey, sweetie.

3012
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,014
What kind of terms would you
be talking about if I...

3013
02:09:37,015 --> 02:09:38,349
I don't know.

3014
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:41,394
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

3015
02:09:41,395 --> 02:09:44,522
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

3016
02:09:44,523 --> 02:09:47,358
Ticky-tack shit like
that, you know.

3017
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:49,443
You pay a couple million
dollars in fines,

3018
02:09:49,444 --> 02:09:52,468
in exchange, the SEC fucks
off till the end of time.

3019
02:09:54,741 --> 02:09:56,468
And Stratton?

3020
02:09:56,868 --> 02:09:58,828
What happens to Stratton?

3021
02:09:58,829 --> 02:10:01,706
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

3022
02:10:01,707 --> 02:10:02,957
Let Donnie be in charge.

3023
02:10:02,958 --> 02:10:04,651
Right. Donnie.

3024
02:10:05,294 --> 02:10:07,545
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

3025
02:10:07,546 --> 02:10:09,380
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

3026
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:12,216
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

3027
02:10:12,217 --> 02:10:14,260
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

3028
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:16,705
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

3029
02:10:17,723 --> 02:10:19,056
Jordan.

3030
02:10:19,057 --> 02:10:21,100
What do you have to think about?

3031
02:10:21,101 --> 02:10:22,727
You beat them.

3032
02:10:22,728 --> 02:10:23,978
You won!

3033
02:10:23,979 --> 02:10:25,688
God knows you never
have to work again.

3034
02:10:25,689 --> 02:10:27,732
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3035
02:10:27,733 --> 02:10:28,899
- Is that what you want?
- No.

3036
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,067
- Of course not.
- Okay.

3037
02:10:30,068 --> 02:10:32,194
Okay! You got all the
money in the world.

3038
02:10:32,195 --> 02:10:33,863
You need everybody else's money?

3039
02:10:33,864 --> 02:10:35,364
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

3040
02:10:35,365 --> 02:10:37,742
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

3041
02:10:37,743 --> 02:10:39,595
You built it, so now preserve it.

3042
02:11:10,734 --> 02:11:12,211
You know,

3043
02:11:12,527 --> 02:11:15,321
five years ago, when I
started Stratton Oakmont

3044
02:11:15,322 --> 02:11:17,448
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3045
02:11:17,449 --> 02:11:20,894
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

3046
02:11:22,746 --> 02:11:24,372
And it's truly with a heavy heart

3047
02:11:24,373 --> 02:11:26,646
that I'm here to say that...

3048
02:11:28,126 --> 02:11:30,503
That that day is finally here.

3049
02:11:34,549 --> 02:11:36,926
I wanna...
I want to thank you all for your...

3050
02:11:36,927 --> 02:11:39,678
Your years of loyalty
and admiration.

3051
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,281
But the point is this.

3052
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,474
Under Donnie's leadership,

3053
02:11:43,475 --> 02:11:47,019
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

3054
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:49,939
moving into key management
positions, this place really

3055
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:51,315
is gonna be better than ever!

3056
02:11:51,316 --> 02:11:53,589
That I promise you. Okay?

3057
02:11:53,819 --> 02:11:56,422
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

3058
02:11:59,449 --> 02:12:02,243
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3059
02:12:02,244 --> 02:12:03,994
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

3060
02:12:03,995 --> 02:12:06,622
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking Mayflower

3061
02:12:06,623 --> 02:12:08,833
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3062
02:12:08,834 --> 02:12:11,168
this right here is the
land of opportunity.

3063
02:12:11,169 --> 02:12:13,772
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3064
02:12:17,717 --> 02:12:19,468
All of you know
Kimmie Belzer, right?

3065
02:12:19,469 --> 02:12:20,719
Yes, we do.

3066
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:21,929
Fuck you.

3067
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:23,848
Come on, Kimmie.

3068
02:12:23,849 --> 02:12:25,433
What you probably didn't know is,

3069
02:12:25,434 --> 02:12:27,351
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

3070
02:12:27,352 --> 02:12:29,705
one of Stratton's original 20.

3071
02:12:30,355 --> 02:12:32,314
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3072
02:12:32,315 --> 02:12:35,419
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

3073
02:12:35,694 --> 02:12:38,923
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

3074
02:12:40,782 --> 02:12:43,476
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

3075
02:12:44,035 --> 02:12:45,953
A woman who spends

3076
02:12:45,954 --> 02:12:47,496
her winters in the Bahamas

3077
02:12:47,497 --> 02:12:49,691
and summers in the Hamptons!

3078
02:12:54,588 --> 02:12:57,032
That's not the
Kimmie that I met.

3079
02:12:59,759 --> 02:13:03,659
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

3080
02:13:04,764 --> 02:13:07,099
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

3081
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:09,018
with an 8-year-old son.

3082
02:13:09,019 --> 02:13:12,123
Okay? She was three months
behind on her rent.

3083
02:13:13,064 --> 02:13:16,859
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

3084
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,111
she asked for a $5,000 advance

3085
02:13:19,112 --> 02:13:22,386
just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

3086
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:28,579
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3087
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:30,353
Go on, tell them.

3088
02:13:32,042 --> 02:13:34,190
You wrote me a check

3089
02:13:34,294 --> 02:13:36,522
for $25,000.

3090
02:13:37,714 --> 02:13:39,236
That's right.

3091
02:13:39,257 --> 02:13:40,700
Thank you.

3092
02:13:44,012 --> 02:13:45,864
And you know why that is?

3093
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:51,544
It's because I believed in you.

3094
02:13:53,104 --> 02:13:55,923
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie,

3095
02:13:56,274 --> 02:13:58,108
just like I believe in each

3096
02:13:58,109 --> 02:14:00,236
and every one of you here today.

3097
02:14:00,237 --> 02:14:02,696
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

3098
02:14:02,697 --> 02:14:04,615
I fucking love you!
I love you.

3099
02:14:04,616 --> 02:14:07,515
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

3100
02:14:10,288 --> 02:14:12,390
And I love all of you!

3101
02:14:12,916 --> 02:14:15,292
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

3102
02:14:15,293 --> 02:14:17,896
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

3103
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:20,983
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

3104
02:14:27,389 --> 02:14:29,662
It's a shame, you know.

3105
02:14:31,142 --> 02:14:33,227
For years, I've been
telling you guys

3106
02:14:33,228 --> 02:14:35,354
never to take no for
an answer, right?

3107
02:14:35,355 --> 02:14:38,675
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

3108
02:14:39,484 --> 02:14:41,837
until you get what you want.

3109
02:14:42,654 --> 02:14:44,472
Because you all deserve it.

3110
02:14:46,408 --> 02:14:49,728
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

3111
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:52,329
barring me from the
securities industry,

3112
02:14:52,330 --> 02:14:54,432
barring me from Stratton,

3113
02:14:55,417 --> 02:14:56,939
my home.

3114
02:14:59,629 --> 02:15:01,731
What the fuck is that,
you know?

3115
02:15:02,841 --> 02:15:05,285
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3116
02:15:05,885 --> 02:15:08,784
It's me taking no for an answer,
you know.

3117
02:15:10,181 --> 02:15:11,515
It's them...

3118
02:15:11,516 --> 02:15:14,870
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

3119
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:18,339
It's me being a hypocrite
is what it is.

3120
02:15:23,403 --> 02:15:24,800
So...

3121
02:15:31,786 --> 02:15:33,479
You know what?

3122
02:15:37,167 --> 02:15:38,834
I'm not leaving.

3123
02:15:41,087 --> 02:15:42,484
I'm not leaving.

3124
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,550
I'm not fucking leaving!

3125
02:15:51,556 --> 02:15:54,034
You're not getting
a fucking promotion!

3126
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:56,787
The show goes on!

3127
02:15:59,272 --> 02:16:00,773
This is my home!

3128
02:16:00,774 --> 02:16:03,609
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

3129
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:05,633
to take me out of here!

3130
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:10,074
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

3131
02:16:10,075 --> 02:16:11,909
or fucking SWAT team

3132
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:14,513
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3133
02:16:17,248 --> 02:16:18,349
Fuck them!

3134
02:16:20,752 --> 02:16:22,650
Fuck them!

3135
02:16:56,621 --> 02:16:58,539
Jordy! Jordy!

3136
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:00,642
Jordy! Get back here!

3137
02:17:01,418 --> 02:17:02,644
Hey!

3138
02:17:05,004 --> 02:17:06,338
Give me that.

3139
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:09,967
What is this?

3140
02:17:09,968 --> 02:17:12,571
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,
for Christ sake?</i>

3141
02:17:13,596 --> 02:17:16,598
<i>Paddy D,
mazel tov, you Irishman.</i>

3142
02:17:16,599 --> 02:17:20,144
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

3143
02:17:20,145 --> 02:17:22,919
<i>He is back in the ocean.
Happy hunting.</i>

3144
02:17:35,702 --> 02:17:38,078
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

3145
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:40,807
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

3146
02:17:41,541 --> 02:17:43,917
<i>I apologized, even
offered to pay him</i>

3147
02:17:43,918 --> 02:17:45,611
<i>for his time in the can.</i>

3148
02:17:46,129 --> 02:17:48,297
<i>But he said no,
that he was out.</i>

3149
02:17:48,298 --> 02:17:50,215
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

3150
02:17:50,216 --> 02:17:51,925
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

3151
02:17:51,926 --> 02:17:53,510
<i>two years later</i>

3152
02:17:53,511 --> 02:17:55,284
<i>he was dead.</i>

3153
02:17:55,346 --> 02:17:57,824
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

3154
02:17:58,516 --> 02:18:00,976
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

3155
02:18:00,977 --> 02:18:04,313
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

3156
02:18:04,314 --> 02:18:06,712
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

3157
02:18:08,777 --> 02:18:10,027
<i>Within days,</i>

3158
02:18:10,028 --> 02:18:12,488
<i>subpoenas started flying.</i>

3159
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:15,866
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

3160
02:18:15,867 --> 02:18:17,993
<i>Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.</i>

3161
02:18:17,994 --> 02:18:20,537
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

3162
02:18:20,538 --> 02:18:23,938
Here's what we do with
subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3163
02:18:29,547 --> 02:18:32,257
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

3164
02:18:32,258 --> 02:18:34,218
Fuck you! Fuck you!

3165
02:18:34,219 --> 02:18:36,822
Fuck you!

3166
02:18:41,976 --> 02:18:43,328
Oh!

3167
02:18:43,770 --> 02:18:45,813
Jordan Belfort.

3168
02:18:45,814 --> 02:18:47,898
Alden. That's a nice name.

3169
02:18:47,899 --> 02:18:49,233
Thank you very much for that.

3170
02:18:49,234 --> 02:18:51,527
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

3171
02:18:51,528 --> 02:18:53,237
I do not recall that.

3172
02:18:53,238 --> 02:18:55,697
I do not recall that. Okay?

3173
02:18:55,698 --> 02:18:57,908
Mr. Ming,
thank you for coming in today.

3174
02:18:57,909 --> 02:18:59,618
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3175
02:18:59,619 --> 02:19:00,911
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3176
02:19:00,912 --> 02:19:02,704
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3177
02:19:02,705 --> 02:19:04,414
I got a low blood sugar,
thyroid thing.

3178
02:19:04,415 --> 02:19:05,624
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3179
02:19:05,625 --> 02:19:07,751
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3180
02:19:07,752 --> 02:19:09,419
Tell him to proceed
with the questions.

3181
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,922
<i>But not a single
Strattonite cracked.</i>

3182
02:19:11,923 --> 02:19:13,674
Gladys Carrera?

3183
02:19:13,675 --> 02:19:15,300
Doesn't ring a bell.

3184
02:19:15,301 --> 02:19:18,029
Sorry, I have no
recommendation of that.

3185
02:19:18,096 --> 02:19:19,179
No.

3186
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:20,264
No idea.

3187
02:19:20,265 --> 02:19:22,850
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3188
02:19:22,851 --> 02:19:25,227
Absolutely not.

3189
02:19:25,228 --> 02:19:27,104
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3190
02:19:27,105 --> 02:19:29,439
I just thought you
might remember that.

3191
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:30,983
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3192
02:19:30,984 --> 02:19:32,818
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3193
02:19:32,819 --> 02:19:35,112
I do not...
No, I don't recall.

3194
02:19:35,113 --> 02:19:36,822
It was a long phone call.

3195
02:19:36,823 --> 02:19:38,615
I just wondered
if you have any memory of that.

3196
02:19:38,616 --> 02:19:40,450
Okay. You know we've
talked to several

3197
02:19:40,451 --> 02:19:41,827
of the employees at this firm

3198
02:19:41,828 --> 02:19:43,120
and nobody can recall anything

3199
02:19:43,121 --> 02:19:45,247
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3200
02:19:45,248 --> 02:19:46,565
I think it's Odd.

3201
02:19:48,334 --> 02:19:49,626
Do you recall.

3202
02:19:49,627 --> 02:19:50,919
Cartage Corporation?

3203
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:52,337
Mmm.

3204
02:19:52,338 --> 02:19:53,672
You do recall it?

3205
02:19:53,673 --> 02:19:55,070
No, I don't recall that at all.

3206
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:58,574
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3207
02:19:59,137 --> 02:20:01,305
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

3208
02:20:01,306 --> 02:20:02,681
Are you gonna
comment on my hair?

3209
02:20:02,682 --> 02:20:04,474
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3210
02:20:04,475 --> 02:20:06,268
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3211
02:20:06,269 --> 02:20:08,212
Sorry. I don't
recall that company.

3212
02:20:10,148 --> 02:20:11,982
Can I get you anything
else, gentlemen?

3213
02:20:11,983 --> 02:20:13,901
Yes. Sweetheart,
I have a rare condition

3214
02:20:13,902 --> 02:20:15,319
which requires me to
drink one of those

3215
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:17,422
every 15 minutes, please.

3216
02:20:17,822 --> 02:20:20,991
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3217
02:20:20,992 --> 02:20:23,140
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3218
02:20:23,453 --> 02:20:25,913
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3219
02:20:25,914 --> 02:20:27,372
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3220
02:20:27,373 --> 02:20:29,666
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove.</i>

3221
02:20:29,667 --> 02:20:31,710
<i>I was still running
Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3222
02:20:31,711 --> 02:20:33,045
Hey, Rugrat.

3223
02:20:33,046 --> 02:20:34,338
<i>- Oh!
- Bonjour.</i>

3224
02:20:34,339 --> 02:20:36,381
You bald-headed eagle,
how you doing?

3225
02:20:36,382 --> 02:20:37,466
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3226
02:20:37,467 --> 02:20:38,842
We have a problem, okay.

3227
02:20:38,843 --> 02:20:42,179
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3228
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,306
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3229
02:20:44,307 --> 02:20:45,933
<i>- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3230
02:20:45,934 --> 02:20:48,518
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3231
02:20:48,519 --> 02:20:49,840
Who told you that?
It's bullshit!

3232
02:20:50,188 --> 02:20:52,040
Give me that goddamn phone.

3233
02:20:52,106 --> 02:20:53,799
What's going on?

3234
02:20:53,858 --> 02:20:56,026
Jordan, look.
I'm watching the screen

3235
02:20:56,027 --> 02:20:58,862
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3236
02:20:58,863 --> 02:21:00,948
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3237
02:21:00,949 --> 02:21:03,075
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3238
02:21:03,076 --> 02:21:04,159
It's Donnie.
Call me back, all right.

3239
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,243
Donnie, your little friend

3240
02:21:05,244 --> 02:21:06,578
is trying to fuck
me, you know that.

3241
02:21:06,579 --> 02:21:08,372
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3242
02:21:08,373 --> 02:21:10,040
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3243
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:11,518
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3244
02:21:11,918 --> 02:21:13,710
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3245
02:21:13,711 --> 02:21:16,880
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3246
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:19,216
<i>the shares were in his fucking name.</i>

3247
02:21:19,217 --> 02:21:21,510
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3248
02:21:21,511 --> 02:21:23,387
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3249
02:21:23,388 --> 02:21:24,930
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3250
02:21:24,931 --> 02:21:26,765
I want you to get all our clients
on the phone right now

3251
02:21:26,766 --> 02:21:28,183
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3252
02:21:28,184 --> 02:21:29,726
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3253
02:21:29,727 --> 02:21:31,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?
Shut the fuck up!</font>

3254
02:21:31,562 --> 02:21:33,105
This is <font color="#FFFFFF">your fucking friend</font>
from high school.

3255
02:21:33,106 --> 02:21:35,273
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If that little fucking prick thinks
he can fuck with me,</i></font>

3256
02:21:35,274 --> 02:21:37,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?</font>

3257
02:21:37,944 --> 02:21:39,444
- <font color="#FFFFFF">You got it?
- Yes. I got it!</font>

3258
02:21:39,445 --> 02:21:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Let's just not
jump to conclusions</i></font>

3259
02:21:40,989 --> 02:21:42,447
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>before we know what's going on.</i></font>

3260
02:21:42,448 --> 02:21:43,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Ted!</font>

3261
02:21:43,908 --> 02:21:45,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Ted!</font>

3262
02:21:45,493 --> 02:21:47,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang up your phones!
Everybody, hey!</font>

3263
02:21:47,954 --> 02:21:50,853
Turn <font color="#FFFFFF">the boat around!</font>
We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,835 --> 02:21:56,358
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:56,504 --> 02:21:57,856
I just...

3266
02:21:58,172 --> 02:21:59,524
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,591 --> 02:22:02,284
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:03,094 --> 02:22:04,491
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,762 --> 02:22:06,471
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,472 --> 02:22:09,433
What's going on?
Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,434 --> 02:22:11,601
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,602 --> 02:22:14,062
I just got a call
from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:14,063 --> 02:22:15,230
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,231 --> 02:22:17,049
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,317 --> 02:22:21,136
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3276
02:22:21,404 --> 02:22:22,630
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,322 --> 02:22:25,741
Oh, my God!
Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,742 --> 02:22:27,284
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,285 --> 02:22:29,119
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,537
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3281
02:22:30,538 --> 02:22:32,205
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3282
02:22:32,206 --> 02:22:34,124
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3283
02:22:34,125 --> 02:22:37,586
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3284
02:22:37,587 --> 02:22:39,755
The last time I talked to her
she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,756 --> 02:22:41,965
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,966 --> 02:22:44,217
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,218 --> 02:22:46,011
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:46,012 --> 02:22:47,137
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,138 --> 02:22:49,723
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3290
02:22:49,724 --> 02:22:51,558
My condolences to you
and your family.

3291
02:22:51,559 --> 02:22:53,143
Yes. We're absolutely
devastated.

3292
02:22:53,144 --> 02:22:55,270
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,271 --> 02:22:56,563
Now where does that leave us

3294
02:22:56,564 --> 02:22:58,231
in regard to her
account exactly?

3295
02:22:58,232 --> 02:22:59,816
Does it go into probate or what?

3296
02:22:59,817 --> 02:23:01,485
Not to worry, Jordan.
Not to worry.

3297
02:23:01,486 --> 02:23:03,278
Your aunt, before she died,

3298
02:23:03,279 --> 02:23:06,258
signed a document naming you
as her successor.

3299
02:23:06,449 --> 02:23:07,991
She did?

3300
02:23:07,992 --> 02:23:09,765
Fantastic!
Well, that's good news!

3301
02:23:09,952 --> 02:23:12,225
Well, not as of yet.

3302
02:23:12,413 --> 02:23:14,498
What does that mean?
Not as of yet?

3303
02:23:16,834 --> 02:23:18,668
I can't seem to hear you.

3304
02:23:18,669 --> 02:23:21,443
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3305
02:23:21,506 --> 02:23:24,299
<i>- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
- Fast?</i>

3306
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:26,468
I have to get to
Switzerland now?

3307
02:23:28,096 --> 02:23:30,263
Speak English!
Fucking speak English!

3308
02:23:30,264 --> 02:23:31,681
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Quiet, okay?

3309
02:23:31,682 --> 02:23:33,183
Take your suit,
take your dick, okay,

3310
02:23:33,184 --> 02:23:34,976
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3311
02:23:34,977 --> 02:23:37,062
Move my ass! Yes!

3312
02:23:37,063 --> 02:23:41,274
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3313
02:23:41,275 --> 02:23:43,318
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3314
02:23:43,319 --> 02:23:45,362
<i>who could fake Aunt
Emma's signature.</i>

3315
02:23:45,363 --> 02:23:47,010
You American shit!

3316
02:23:47,073 --> 02:23:48,907
<i>I just had to get
there by tomorrow,</i>

3317
02:23:48,908 --> 02:23:50,534
<i>or lose $20 million.</i>

3318
02:23:50,535 --> 02:23:52,353
We're going to Monaco!

3319
02:23:52,829 --> 02:23:55,205
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3320
02:23:55,206 --> 02:23:57,874
We're going to Monaco, so then
we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3321
02:23:57,875 --> 02:23:59,648
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3322
02:23:59,669 --> 02:24:00,919
But I have business
in Switzerland.

3323
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:02,629
I need to go to
Switzerland right now.

3324
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:04,824
Bottom line. Sorry.

3325
02:24:05,049 --> 02:24:06,901
We gotta get to London.

3326
02:24:07,343 --> 02:24:08,660
Why? Why?

3327
02:24:10,054 --> 02:24:11,346
The funeral!

3328
02:24:11,347 --> 02:24:12,790
Yeah, but babe.
Look, look...

3329
02:24:13,141 --> 02:24:15,976
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the entire world.

3330
02:24:15,977 --> 02:24:17,624
I really did.

3331
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:20,313
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3332
02:24:20,314 --> 02:24:22,607
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3333
02:24:22,608 --> 02:24:23,900
She'll still be dead by the time

3334
02:24:23,901 --> 02:24:25,127
we get to London, okay?

3335
02:24:25,653 --> 02:24:27,487
Captain Ted! Captain
Ted, all right, look.

3336
02:24:27,488 --> 02:24:29,406
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3337
02:24:29,407 --> 02:24:30,490
Monaco, right.

3338
02:24:30,491 --> 02:24:32,450
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3339
02:24:32,451 --> 02:24:33,869
so they don't stamp
our passports.

3340
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:35,787
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3341
02:24:35,788 --> 02:24:37,581
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3342
02:24:37,582 --> 02:24:39,124
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3343
02:24:39,125 --> 02:24:40,417
That's the fucking plan.

3344
02:24:40,418 --> 02:24:42,878
I just want you to know
that we might run into some chop.

3345
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:45,130
Chop?
We can fucking handle chop, right?

3346
02:24:45,131 --> 02:24:46,631
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3347
02:24:46,632 --> 02:24:48,049
No, no, no. We're
not going anywhere

3348
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:49,426
unless he says it's
safe, all right.

3349
02:24:49,427 --> 02:24:50,969
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3350
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:52,429
You don't know shit about chop.

3351
02:24:52,430 --> 02:24:54,681
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3352
02:24:54,682 --> 02:24:57,100
I'll chop your fucking credit
card in half. How about that?

3353
02:24:57,101 --> 02:24:59,102
Chop is fine. Trust me.
Chop is fine.

3354
02:24:59,103 --> 02:25:00,854
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3355
02:25:00,855 --> 02:25:02,105
Uh...

3356
02:25:02,106 --> 02:25:04,065
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3357
02:25:04,066 --> 02:25:05,275
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3358
02:25:05,276 --> 02:25:06,943
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3359
02:25:06,944 --> 02:25:08,236
It's gonna be safe.

3360
02:25:08,237 --> 02:25:10,447
We'll batten down the hatches

3361
02:25:10,448 --> 02:25:11,907
and secure the deck.

3362
02:25:11,908 --> 02:25:15,452
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3363
02:25:15,453 --> 02:25:16,912
Few broken dishes.

3364
02:25:16,913 --> 02:25:18,163
What's a few broken dishes?

3365
02:25:18,164 --> 02:25:19,539
Does that sound fucking
awesome or what?

3366
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:20,999
No. Not really.

3367
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,375
We're gonna have a
fucking good time!

3368
02:25:22,376 --> 02:25:24,211
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3369
02:25:24,212 --> 02:25:25,404
Let's fucking move!
Let's go!

3370
02:25:30,801 --> 02:25:31,948
Hold On!

3371
02:25:35,014 --> 02:25:38,141
What the fuck is
going on out here?

3372
02:25:38,142 --> 02:25:40,810
The Jet Skis just
went overboard!

3373
02:25:40,811 --> 02:25:42,938
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Honey, you okay?

3374
02:25:42,939 --> 02:25:45,148
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3375
02:25:45,149 --> 02:25:47,984
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3376
02:25:47,985 --> 02:25:49,778
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3377
02:25:49,779 --> 02:25:51,029
- We can't!
- Go!

3378
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:53,698
We'll get broad-sided.
It'll tip over!

3379
02:25:53,699 --> 02:25:55,617
I am a master diver.
You hear that?

3380
02:25:55,618 --> 02:25:56,701
I'm a master diver!

3381
02:25:56,702 --> 02:25:58,036
No one's gonna fucking die!

3382
02:25:58,037 --> 02:26:00,747
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3383
02:26:00,748 --> 02:26:02,123
I love you.

3384
02:26:02,124 --> 02:26:04,125
I love you, baby.
Just hold on tight.

3385
02:26:04,126 --> 02:26:05,210
Okay.

3386
02:26:05,211 --> 02:26:06,358
Donnie!

3387
02:26:07,838 --> 02:26:09,172
Hold on, baby!

3388
02:26:09,173 --> 02:26:10,274
Donnie!

3389
02:26:12,176 --> 02:26:13,323
Donnie!

3390
02:26:13,719 --> 02:26:15,178
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3391
02:26:15,179 --> 02:26:16,805
Get the fucking ludes.

3392
02:26:16,806 --> 02:26:18,014
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3393
02:26:18,015 --> 02:26:20,834
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3394
02:26:20,851 --> 02:26:23,812
I fucked up!
I fucked up so bad!

3395
02:26:23,813 --> 02:26:25,881
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3396
02:26:26,023 --> 02:26:27,295
What are you saying?

3397
02:26:27,692 --> 02:26:29,260
Fuck!

3398
02:26:30,027 --> 02:26:31,278
Get the ludes!

3399
02:26:31,279 --> 02:26:32,988
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3400
02:26:32,989 --> 02:26:34,322
It's three feet of
water down there!

3401
02:26:34,323 --> 02:26:37,158
I will not die sober!

3402
02:26:37,159 --> 02:26:38,994
Get those fucking ludes!

3403
02:26:38,995 --> 02:26:40,078
Okay!

3404
02:26:40,079 --> 02:26:41,522
- Go!
- Okay.

3405
02:26:44,292 --> 02:26:46,126
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3406
02:26:46,127 --> 02:26:47,836
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3407
02:26:47,837 --> 02:26:49,277
He's just warning everybody!

3408
02:27:01,142 --> 02:27:02,994
Jesus Christ!

3409
02:27:04,437 --> 02:27:05,729
Hold on!

3410
02:27:05,730 --> 02:27:07,230
Get away from the window!

3411
02:27:07,231 --> 02:27:08,732
Rogue wave!

3412
02:27:08,733 --> 02:27:09,858
Mayday!

3413
02:27:09,859 --> 02:27:12,527
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3414
02:27:12,528 --> 02:27:14,130
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3415
02:27:14,447 --> 02:27:15,799
I got 'em!

3416
02:27:16,866 --> 02:27:18,450
Give me one for the nerves!

3417
02:27:18,451 --> 02:27:19,701
We're going down!

3418
02:27:19,702 --> 02:27:21,953
This is a fucking Mayday!

3419
02:27:21,954 --> 02:27:24,182
We require immediate assistance!

3420
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:27,375
Hold on!

3421
02:27:27,376 --> 02:27:28,477
Watch out!

3422
02:27:40,264 --> 02:27:42,913
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3423
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:46,770
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3424
02:27:46,771 --> 02:27:48,839
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3425
02:28:05,289 --> 02:28:07,062
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3426
02:28:07,375 --> 02:28:10,399
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3427
02:28:11,212 --> 02:28:12,879
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i>

3428
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,048
<i>when a seagull flew
into the engine.</i>

3429
02:28:15,049 --> 02:28:17,151
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3430
02:28:21,263 --> 02:28:23,139
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3431
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:26,369
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3432
02:28:31,690 --> 02:28:35,443
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3433
02:28:35,444 --> 02:28:38,154
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3434
02:28:38,155 --> 02:28:40,115
Would you like to own
a home like this,

3435
02:28:40,116 --> 02:28:42,325
but can barely afford
to pay your rent?

3436
02:28:42,326 --> 02:28:44,035
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3437
02:28:44,036 --> 02:28:46,162
and there's no secret
to wealth creation.

3438
02:28:46,163 --> 02:28:47,497
No matter who you are,

3439
02:28:47,498 --> 02:28:48,832
no matter where you came from,

3440
02:28:48,833 --> 02:28:51,376
you too can become
financially independent

3441
02:28:51,377 --> 02:28:53,211
in just a matter of months.

3442
02:28:53,212 --> 02:28:55,463
All you need is a strategy.

3443
02:28:55,464 --> 02:28:57,173
When I was 24 years old,

3444
02:28:57,174 --> 02:29:01,052
I made a decision not just
to survive, but to thrive.

3445
02:29:01,053 --> 02:29:03,596
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3446
02:29:03,597 --> 02:29:07,142
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3447
02:29:07,143 --> 02:29:08,351
I certainly believe now.

3448
02:29:08,352 --> 02:29:09,853
Think about it for a second.

3449
02:29:09,854 --> 02:29:12,021
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's.

3450
02:29:12,022 --> 02:29:14,274
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3451
02:29:14,275 --> 02:29:15,942
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3452
02:29:15,943 --> 02:29:17,694
<i>If you want to be
a millionaire someday,</i>

3453
02:29:17,695 --> 02:29:19,779
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3454
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:21,114
Jordan Belfort's
setup worked for me

3455
02:29:21,115 --> 02:29:22,615
because I worked hard for it.

3456
02:29:22,616 --> 02:29:24,159
And if it doesn't work for you,

3457
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:25,243
it's because you're lazy.

3458
02:29:25,244 --> 02:29:26,536
And you should get a
job at McDonald's.

3459
02:29:26,537 --> 02:29:29,497
<i>There's nobody holding
you back from financial freedom.</i>

3460
02:29:29,498 --> 02:29:32,459
And there's nobody stopping
you from making millions.

3461
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:33,793
Don't just sit at home,

3462
02:29:33,794 --> 02:29:36,522
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3463
02:29:39,216 --> 02:29:41,176
I changed all these people's lives

3464
02:29:41,177 --> 02:29:42,886
and I can change yours, too!

3465
02:29:42,887 --> 02:29:44,220
So come to my seminar!

3466
02:29:44,221 --> 02:29:45,722
The life of your dreams is only...

3467
02:29:45,723 --> 02:29:47,515
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3468
02:29:47,516 --> 02:29:48,641
You're under arrest!

3469
02:29:48,642 --> 02:29:50,335
You gotta be joking!

3470
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,812
You're kidding me.

3471
02:29:52,813 --> 02:29:54,481
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3472
02:29:54,482 --> 02:29:55,815
Turn that camera off.

3473
02:29:55,816 --> 02:29:57,901
I'm fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here,

3474
02:29:57,902 --> 02:29:59,402
you fucking cocksucker!

3475
02:29:59,403 --> 02:30:01,154
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3476
02:30:01,155 --> 02:30:03,031
You don't got shit
on me, you hear me!

3477
02:30:03,032 --> 02:30:04,157
Go fuck yourself!

3478
02:30:04,158 --> 02:30:06,618
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3479
02:30:06,619 --> 02:30:07,744
Hey, Jordan,

3480
02:30:07,745 --> 02:30:09,704
let me give you a
little legal advice.

3481
02:30:09,705 --> 02:30:11,206
Shut the fuck up!

3482
02:30:11,207 --> 02:30:12,790
Oh, fuck you,
you fucking prick!

3483
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:15,485
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3484
02:30:17,171 --> 02:30:18,713
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3485
02:30:18,714 --> 02:30:21,341
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3486
02:30:21,342 --> 02:30:24,177
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3487
02:30:24,178 --> 02:30:26,471
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted
down in Miami.</i>

3488
02:30:26,472 --> 02:30:27,805
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3489
02:30:27,806 --> 02:30:29,599
<i>And guess who
the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3490
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:30,725
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3491
02:30:30,726 --> 02:30:33,061
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3492
02:30:33,062 --> 02:30:34,854
<i>I mean, what are
the fucking odds?</i>

3493
02:30:34,855 --> 02:30:37,607
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3494
02:30:37,608 --> 02:30:39,275
<i>and Rugrat gets the
one dumb enough</i>

3495
02:30:39,276 --> 02:30:41,444
<i>to get himself arrested
on U.S. soil.</i>

3496
02:30:41,445 --> 02:30:42,922
I know.

3497
02:30:42,947 --> 02:30:44,424
I'm so sorry.

3498
02:30:46,534 --> 02:30:47,825
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3499
02:30:47,826 --> 02:30:49,285
<i>was that he got busted</i>

3500
02:30:49,286 --> 02:30:51,037
<i>for shit that had
nothing to do with me.</i>

3501
02:30:51,038 --> 02:30:52,705
<i>It had nothing to
fucking do with me.</i>

3502
02:30:52,706 --> 02:30:54,791
<i>Something about
laundering drug money</i>

3503
02:30:54,792 --> 02:30:57,961
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3504
02:30:57,962 --> 02:31:00,129
<i>you know,
the founder of Benihana.</i>

3505
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:01,589
<i>Benihana.</i>

3506
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:03,363
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3507
02:31:03,676 --> 02:31:05,510
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3508
02:31:05,511 --> 02:31:06,594
<i>Why?</i>

3509
02:31:06,595 --> 02:31:08,012
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3510
02:31:08,013 --> 02:31:09,597
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3511
02:31:09,598 --> 02:31:12,225
<i>as to choose a chain
of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3512
02:31:12,226 --> 02:31:13,578
<i>to take me down?</i>

3513
02:31:15,896 --> 02:31:18,481
<i>Long story short.
Saurel rats me out.</i>

3514
02:31:18,482 --> 02:31:21,651
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3515
02:31:21,652 --> 02:31:23,319
<i>who, it turns out,
he'd been fucking</i>

3516
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:25,889
<i>every time she went
to Switzerland!</i>

3517
02:31:27,741 --> 02:31:30,390
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3518
02:31:32,496 --> 02:31:34,330
- All right!
- Ah!

3519
02:31:34,331 --> 02:31:36,165
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy</i>

3520
02:31:36,166 --> 02:31:37,917
<i>to commit securities fraud.</i>

3521
02:31:37,918 --> 02:31:40,211
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3522
02:31:40,212 --> 02:31:43,756
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3523
02:31:43,757 --> 02:31:46,092
Twenty-one counts
money laundering.

3524
02:31:46,093 --> 02:31:48,616
One count obstruction
of justice.

3525
02:31:49,513 --> 02:31:51,832
Bail is set at $10 million.

3526
02:32:06,989 --> 02:32:08,557
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3527
02:32:09,366 --> 02:32:11,685
Rocky.
How you doing?

3528
02:32:12,286 --> 02:32:14,662
Woof.
I hate that fucking dog.

3529
02:32:14,663 --> 02:32:17,040
Yeah, he's getting
old and decrepit.

3530
02:32:17,041 --> 02:32:18,625
Starting to shit in
the house again.

3531
02:32:18,626 --> 02:32:20,418
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3532
02:32:20,419 --> 02:32:21,794
Ah, fuck.

3533
02:32:21,795 --> 02:32:23,546
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3534
02:32:23,547 --> 02:32:24,797
Good to see you.

3535
02:32:24,798 --> 02:32:27,447
Sit down. Oh, man.

3536
02:32:29,219 --> 02:32:30,571
How you doing, brother?

3537
02:32:31,305 --> 02:32:32,889
You know.

3538
02:32:32,890 --> 02:32:34,641
Shitty, pal.

3539
02:32:34,642 --> 02:32:36,870
But I'm hanging in there.

3540
02:32:38,103 --> 02:32:40,730
My new piece of jewelry.
Check that out.

3541
02:32:40,731 --> 02:32:43,191
Can't leave the house,
you know?

3542
02:32:43,192 --> 02:32:45,841
Starting to get cabin
fever already.

3543
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:48,013
Fucking Rugrat.

3544
02:32:48,447 --> 02:32:49,864
That wig-wearing faggot.

3545
02:32:49,865 --> 02:32:52,075
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3546
02:32:52,076 --> 02:32:54,744
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3547
02:32:54,745 --> 02:32:57,080
Irresponsible little prick.

3548
02:32:58,207 --> 02:32:59,354
I'll tell you one thing.

3549
02:33:00,584 --> 02:33:03,187
I'm never eating
at Benihana again.

3550
02:33:03,921 --> 02:33:06,194
I don't care whose
birthday it is.

3551
02:33:07,508 --> 02:33:09,201
Where's Naomi?
How's she doing?

3552
02:33:09,885 --> 02:33:11,260
That's her in the house there.

3553
02:33:11,261 --> 02:33:13,329
You could say hi, but she
probably won't wave back.

3554
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:15,203
Naomi, sweetheart!

3555
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,894
What's up her ass?

3556
02:33:19,895 --> 02:33:21,479
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3557
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:23,064
We probably have to
mortgage the house

3558
02:33:23,065 --> 02:33:24,941
in order to make bail.

3559
02:33:24,942 --> 02:33:26,442
Probably end up
selling the thing

3560
02:33:26,443 --> 02:33:28,695
in order to pay for
all the lawyers.

3561
02:33:28,696 --> 02:33:31,265
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3562
02:33:31,448 --> 02:33:33,221
What are you gonna do, right?

3563
02:33:33,951 --> 02:33:36,828
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3564
02:33:36,829 --> 02:33:37,995
How's morale?

3565
02:33:37,996 --> 02:33:40,748
They all pissed off 'cause they
have to make money legally now?

3566
02:33:40,749 --> 02:33:42,271
- Jordan.
- Hmm?

3567
02:33:42,543 --> 02:33:45,086
I got the founding
partners together.

3568
02:33:45,087 --> 02:33:47,565
I talked to them
about everything.

3569
02:33:48,215 --> 02:33:49,362
And I got you.

3570
02:33:50,092 --> 02:33:51,739
What do you mean, you got me?

3571
02:33:52,803 --> 02:33:55,622
The house, money, don't
worry about it. I got you.

3572
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:02,687
All right.

3573
02:34:02,688 --> 02:34:03,771
I love you, buddy.

3574
02:34:03,772 --> 02:34:05,773
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3575
02:34:05,774 --> 02:34:07,842
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3576
02:34:08,694 --> 02:34:09,944
I could fucking
kiss you all over.

3577
02:34:09,945 --> 02:34:11,154
All right, enough, enough.

3578
02:34:13,157 --> 02:34:14,407
You want a beer, pal?

3579
02:34:14,408 --> 02:34:15,700
What are you drinking?

3580
02:34:15,701 --> 02:34:17,869
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3581
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:19,162
What's that?

3582
02:34:19,163 --> 02:34:22,290
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

3583
02:34:22,291 --> 02:34:24,644
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3584
02:34:25,127 --> 02:34:26,461
But if you drink enough,

3585
02:34:26,462 --> 02:34:28,463
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3586
02:34:28,464 --> 02:34:30,631
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3587
02:34:30,632 --> 02:34:31,758
I'm not a scientist.

3588
02:34:31,759 --> 02:34:33,009
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3589
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:34,677
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3590
02:34:34,678 --> 02:34:36,929
I know, but I don't drink.
You remember?

3591
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:38,181
I don't drink anymore.

3592
02:34:38,182 --> 02:34:39,265
Oh, you wanna go inside

3593
02:34:39,266 --> 02:34:40,767
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

3594
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:42,685
Or baking soda...

3595
02:34:42,686 --> 02:34:45,062
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

3596
02:34:45,063 --> 02:34:46,606
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3597
02:34:46,607 --> 02:34:48,191
How's being sober?

3598
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:50,151
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3599
02:34:50,152 --> 02:34:52,630
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3600
02:34:53,071 --> 02:34:55,698
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3601
02:34:55,699 --> 02:34:57,241
unless circumstances dictate,

3602
02:34:57,242 --> 02:34:59,327
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

3603
02:34:59,328 --> 02:35:00,828
and the term is "Grenada."

3604
02:35:00,829 --> 02:35:02,413
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3605
02:35:02,414 --> 02:35:03,581
No. No, I haven't.

3606
02:35:03,582 --> 02:35:05,208
Grenada's very
interesting because

3607
02:35:05,209 --> 02:35:07,210
it is a small island nation

3608
02:35:07,211 --> 02:35:10,838
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

3609
02:35:10,839 --> 02:35:13,007
It's about 90,000 people.

3610
02:35:13,008 --> 02:35:15,327
And essentially, it means

3611
02:35:16,011 --> 02:35:18,054
this case is unloseable.

3612
02:35:18,055 --> 02:35:19,222
Okay?

3613
02:35:19,223 --> 02:35:20,890
So, you know, we can come in,

3614
02:35:20,891 --> 02:35:22,850
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3615
02:35:22,851 --> 02:35:24,060
Nobody gives a fuck.

3616
02:35:24,061 --> 02:35:25,754
I'm gonna win.

3617
02:35:25,813 --> 02:35:27,290
You, sir.

3618
02:35:28,732 --> 02:35:30,550
Are what's known

3619
02:35:31,485 --> 02:35:32,735
as a Grenada.

3620
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,928
Hmm.

3621
02:35:35,781 --> 02:35:38,241
You're looking at
real prison time.

3622
02:35:38,242 --> 02:35:39,325
Hmm.

3623
02:35:39,326 --> 02:35:41,724
Money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years.

3624
02:35:42,621 --> 02:35:45,414
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3625
02:35:45,415 --> 02:35:47,166
shoving cash in your mattress.

3626
02:35:47,167 --> 02:35:48,314
Is that right?

3627
02:35:49,086 --> 02:35:51,609
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3628
02:35:52,214 --> 02:35:56,092
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3629
02:35:56,093 --> 02:35:57,866
that's not our ambition here.

3630
02:35:59,137 --> 02:36:01,764
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3631
02:36:01,765 --> 02:36:05,039
We think they need to
see their day in court as well.

3632
02:36:07,521 --> 02:36:09,605
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3633
02:36:09,606 --> 02:36:12,380
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3634
02:36:13,485 --> 02:36:16,362
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

3635
02:36:16,363 --> 02:36:18,781
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3636
02:36:18,782 --> 02:36:20,867
and he also agrees
to wear a wire.

3637
02:36:20,868 --> 02:36:22,201
Wait...

3638
02:36:22,202 --> 02:36:24,036
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3639
02:36:24,037 --> 02:36:25,371
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

3640
02:36:25,372 --> 02:36:26,789
What does that mean?

3641
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:28,749
You want me to rat?
Is that it?

3642
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:30,126
No, I want you to cooperate.

3643
02:36:30,127 --> 02:36:32,128
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3644
02:36:32,129 --> 02:36:35,654
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3645
02:36:40,053 --> 02:36:41,971
How was Cristy's party?

3646
02:36:41,972 --> 02:36:43,139
Fine.

3647
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:44,583
Good.

3648
02:36:45,642 --> 02:36:48,185
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3649
02:36:48,186 --> 02:36:50,938
I have some really,
really great news.

3650
02:36:50,939 --> 02:36:52,382
Mmm-hmm.

3651
02:36:52,691 --> 02:36:55,385
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3652
02:36:56,236 --> 02:36:57,987
I know that already.

3653
02:36:57,988 --> 02:36:59,385
Right. Exactly.

3654
02:36:59,698 --> 02:37:03,018
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3655
02:37:03,744 --> 02:37:06,063
It turns out, all the FBI really

3656
02:37:06,622 --> 02:37:08,599
wants from me is to, uh,

3657
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:10,392
to cooperate.

3658
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:11,834
You know?

3659
02:37:11,835 --> 02:37:13,210
Turns out I have so
much information

3660
02:37:13,211 --> 02:37:14,879
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

3661
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,088
I could save the government

3662
02:37:16,089 --> 02:37:18,090
years of heartache,
not to mention

3663
02:37:18,091 --> 02:37:20,569
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

3664
02:37:20,886 --> 02:37:23,330
But it gets even better, babe.

3665
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:26,329
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

3666
02:37:26,642 --> 02:37:29,518
I might only be
looking at four short years,

3667
02:37:29,519 --> 02:37:31,103
in which case, you know,

3668
02:37:31,104 --> 02:37:34,190
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3669
02:37:34,191 --> 02:37:35,942
And any fines that
I'd have to pay

3670
02:37:35,943 --> 02:37:37,818
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

3671
02:37:37,819 --> 02:37:40,196
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

3672
02:37:40,197 --> 02:37:41,719
Mmm-hmm.

3673
02:37:42,741 --> 02:37:45,242
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

3674
02:37:45,243 --> 02:37:47,596
is this whole idea of having to

3675
02:37:48,121 --> 02:37:50,373
give information
about my friends.

3676
02:37:50,374 --> 02:37:53,709
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3677
02:37:53,710 --> 02:37:55,711
Right. Right. Exactly.

3678
02:37:55,712 --> 02:37:57,380
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3679
02:37:57,381 --> 02:37:59,173
Because they said eventually...

3680
02:37:59,174 --> 02:38:02,134
Eventually everyone's gonna have to
give information on this case.

3681
02:38:02,135 --> 02:38:05,012
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3682
02:38:05,013 --> 02:38:07,223
Well, that's good news. Right?

3683
02:38:07,224 --> 02:38:09,058
Yeah, yeah.

3684
02:38:09,059 --> 02:38:10,832
I'm really happy for you.

3685
02:38:12,145 --> 02:38:15,499
What do you mean, happy for me,
sweetheart?

3686
02:38:16,316 --> 02:38:18,985
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3687
02:38:18,986 --> 02:38:21,009
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3688
02:38:23,031 --> 02:38:24,724
Come here, baby.

3689
02:38:25,158 --> 02:38:26,742
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3690
02:38:26,743 --> 02:38:27,868
Jordan...

3691
02:38:27,869 --> 02:38:29,120
Oh, come on, baby.

3692
02:38:29,121 --> 02:38:31,414
I haven't made love to
you in so long. Please.

3693
02:38:31,415 --> 02:38:33,916
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3694
02:38:33,917 --> 02:38:35,485
No! Jordan, stop it!

3695
02:38:37,087 --> 02:38:39,406
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3696
02:38:43,218 --> 02:38:45,195
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3697
02:38:45,679 --> 02:38:48,328
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3698
02:38:49,099 --> 02:38:51,122
You know how much I
love you, right?

3699
02:38:51,518 --> 02:38:53,791
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3700
02:38:58,942 --> 02:39:01,044
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3701
02:39:02,738 --> 02:39:04,556
You wanna fuck me?

3702
02:39:05,449 --> 02:39:06,615
Good.

3703
02:39:06,616 --> 02:39:08,059
Go ahead.

3704
02:39:08,452 --> 02:39:10,520
Go ahead and fuck me.

3705
02:39:11,455 --> 02:39:13,998
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3706
02:39:13,999 --> 02:39:16,792
I want you to fuck me
like it's the last fucking time.

3707
02:39:16,793 --> 02:39:18,169
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3708
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:19,253
Please hold still.

3709
02:39:19,254 --> 02:39:20,880
'Cause I want you to
come for me, baby.

3710
02:39:20,881 --> 02:39:22,298
Come on, babe.

3711
02:39:22,299 --> 02:39:23,841
Come for me, baby.

3712
02:39:23,842 --> 02:39:25,134
I want you to come for me

3713
02:39:25,135 --> 02:39:26,719
like it's the last fucking time.

3714
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,262
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3715
02:39:28,263 --> 02:39:30,931
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3716
02:39:30,932 --> 02:39:32,141
Come on, baby.

3717
02:39:32,142 --> 02:39:33,517
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3718
02:39:33,518 --> 02:39:35,561
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3719
02:39:35,562 --> 02:39:36,834
Yeah.

3720
02:39:37,564 --> 02:39:39,607
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3721
02:39:39,608 --> 02:39:42,052
Huh? You want me
to come for you?

3722
02:39:43,779 --> 02:39:45,571
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3723
02:39:45,572 --> 02:39:48,175
Oh, God.
 Oh, God.

3724
02:39:49,367 --> 02:39:51,811
Oh, God.

3725
02:39:52,370 --> 02:39:53,913
Oh, God.

3726
02:39:53,914 --> 02:39:55,266
Jesus.

3727
02:39:58,794 --> 02:40:00,169
Oh, baby.

3728
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:02,797
That was so fucking great!

3729
02:40:02,798 --> 02:40:04,150
Oh, God!

3730
02:40:06,426 --> 02:40:08,449
That was the last time.

3731
02:40:08,845 --> 02:40:10,888
What do you mean, baby?

3732
02:40:10,889 --> 02:40:13,959
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3733
02:40:14,851 --> 02:40:17,045
What are you talking about?

3734
02:40:18,939 --> 02:40:20,666
I want a divorce.

3735
02:40:22,192 --> 02:40:24,235
What do you mean,
you want a divorce?

3736
02:40:24,236 --> 02:40:26,362
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3737
02:40:26,363 --> 02:40:28,386
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3738
02:40:28,615 --> 02:40:29,949
You just made love to me.

3739
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:31,117
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3740
02:40:31,118 --> 02:40:33,562
I don't love you
anymore, Jordan!

3741
02:40:34,704 --> 02:40:36,806
Oh, you don't love me?

3742
02:40:37,082 --> 02:40:38,791
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3743
02:40:38,792 --> 02:40:41,085
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3744
02:40:41,086 --> 02:40:43,045
Now that I'm under
federal indictment,

3745
02:40:43,046 --> 02:40:45,047
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3746
02:40:45,048 --> 02:40:46,882
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3747
02:40:46,883 --> 02:40:48,701
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3748
02:40:48,969 --> 02:40:51,303
What kind of person are you?
Tell me.

3749
02:40:51,304 --> 02:40:52,638
You married me!

3750
02:40:52,639 --> 02:40:54,223
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3751
02:40:54,224 --> 02:40:55,975
Jordan, this is how
it's gonna go.

3752
02:40:55,976 --> 02:40:58,227
I'm gonna take
custody of the kids.

3753
02:40:58,228 --> 02:41:00,312
If you agree to the
divorce right now,

3754
02:41:00,313 --> 02:41:01,897
I will allow visitation.

3755
02:41:01,898 --> 02:41:03,816
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3756
02:41:03,817 --> 02:41:05,317
It'll save us both
a lot of money

3757
02:41:05,318 --> 02:41:08,046
and I got a feeling
you're gonna need it.

3758
02:41:09,531 --> 02:41:12,825
You're not taking my kids,
sweetheart. You hear me?

3759
02:41:12,826 --> 02:41:14,326
I've already talked
to the lawyer.

3760
02:41:14,327 --> 02:41:15,578
He said even if you
don't get convicted,

3761
02:41:15,579 --> 02:41:16,829
I've got a good chance
of getting them.

3762
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:17,997
I got news for you.

3763
02:41:17,998 --> 02:41:19,748
You're not fucking
taking my children,

3764
02:41:19,749 --> 02:41:21,522
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3765
02:41:21,918 --> 02:41:24,003
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3766
02:41:24,004 --> 02:41:26,255
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3767
02:41:26,256 --> 02:41:27,699
You hear me?
Fuck you!

3768
02:41:27,841 --> 02:41:30,694
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3769
02:41:39,186 --> 02:41:41,020
Fucking bitch!

3770
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,857
Fucking whore!

3771
02:41:49,154 --> 02:41:51,973
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3772
02:42:00,999 --> 02:42:03,876
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3773
02:42:03,877 --> 02:42:05,127
You're sick!

3774
02:42:05,128 --> 02:42:06,378
You're a sick man!

3775
02:42:06,379 --> 02:42:08,464
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3776
02:42:08,465 --> 02:42:11,050
You think I would let
my kids near you?

3777
02:42:11,051 --> 02:42:12,301
Look at yourself!

3778
02:42:12,302 --> 02:42:13,844
You know what my lawyer said?

3779
02:42:13,845 --> 02:42:17,431
My lawyer said that you're going to
prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3780
02:42:17,432 --> 02:42:20,768
Twenty fucking years! You're
never gonna see the kids again!

3781
02:42:20,769 --> 02:42:22,019
You don't think I'm
not gonna see my...

3782
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:23,896
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3783
02:42:23,897 --> 02:42:26,148
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3784
02:42:26,149 --> 02:42:27,751
Don't you fucking touch them!

3785
02:42:28,985 --> 02:42:30,928
Don't you fucking touch me!

3786
02:42:32,489 --> 02:42:35,824
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3787
02:42:35,825 --> 02:42:37,927
You're coming on a
trip with Daddy.

3788
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:42,915
Don't you fucking touch her,
Jordan.

3789
02:42:42,916 --> 02:42:45,769
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you!

3790
02:42:48,338 --> 02:42:49,672
It's all right, baby.

3791
02:42:49,673 --> 02:42:51,006
You and Daddy are gonna go

3792
02:42:51,007 --> 02:42:52,466
on a little trip together, okay?

3793
02:42:52,467 --> 02:42:54,093
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3794
02:42:54,094 --> 02:42:55,261
Violet!

3795
02:42:55,262 --> 02:42:57,513
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3796
02:42:57,514 --> 02:42:59,223
Jordan,
you open this fucking door

3797
02:42:59,224 --> 02:43:02,142
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3798
02:43:02,143 --> 02:43:03,519
There you go.
Get your legs in.

3799
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,271
I'm taking her with me!

3800
02:43:05,272 --> 02:43:06,563
I told you I'm
taking her with me,

3801
02:43:06,564 --> 02:43:07,982
you fucking bitch!

3802
02:43:07,983 --> 02:43:10,802
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3803
02:43:11,486 --> 02:43:13,634
We're going on a
little trip, honey.

3804
02:43:13,989 --> 02:43:15,591
No! No!

3805
02:43:16,074 --> 02:43:17,533
Get the hell out of here!

3806
02:43:17,534 --> 02:43:19,785
Leave that baby alone!

3807
02:43:19,786 --> 02:43:22,037
Violet! Garage door!
Close it!

3808
02:43:22,038 --> 02:43:23,247
Mommy!

3809
02:43:23,248 --> 02:43:25,541
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3810
02:43:25,542 --> 02:43:27,144
Mommy!

3811
02:43:30,547 --> 02:43:32,274
No!

3812
02:43:39,472 --> 02:43:42,308
Oh, Lord! Oh,
my heavens...

3813
02:43:42,309 --> 02:43:43,684
Get the baby!

3814
02:43:43,685 --> 02:43:45,913
Naomi, get the baby!

3815
02:43:46,563 --> 02:43:48,272
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3816
02:43:48,273 --> 02:43:49,648
It's gonna be okay.

3817
02:43:49,649 --> 02:43:51,751
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3818
02:43:52,652 --> 02:43:54,528
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3819
02:43:54,529 --> 02:43:56,196
She all right?

3820
02:43:56,197 --> 02:43:57,549
Is she all right?

3821
02:43:58,241 --> 02:43:59,888
What's the matter with you?

3822
02:44:00,076 --> 02:44:01,519
Is she all right?

3823
02:44:08,752 --> 02:44:10,252
<i>Paragraph 1.</i>

Thank you.

3844
02:44:48,666 --> 02:44:49,958
Just here?

3845
02:44:49,959 --> 02:44:51,561
That'd be good.

3846
02:44:53,213 --> 02:44:54,421
Thank you.

3847
02:44:54,422 --> 02:44:56,149

<i>Anybody who 'd ever known me</i>

3851
02:45:05,141 --> 02:45:07,518
<i>or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

3852
02:45:12,982 --> 02:45:15,426
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3853
02:45:17,112 --> 02:45:18,885
<i>The first name on the
list was Donnie.</i>

3854
02:45:22,283 --> 02:45:23,826
Jordan, do you know
how good it is

3855
02:45:23,827 --> 02:45:25,520
to have you back in this office?

3856
02:45:25,787 --> 02:45:27,913
It's not the same
when you're gone.

3857
02:45:27,914 --> 02:45:29,706
It's sad, you understand?
It's like...

3858
02:45:29,707 --> 02:45:31,250
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3859
02:45:31,251 --> 02:45:32,501
I can't...

3860
02:45:32,502 --> 02:45:34,378
Swear to God, I can't
even think about it.

3861
02:45:34,379 --> 02:45:36,338
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3862
02:45:36,339 --> 02:45:38,132
I can't even say his name.

3863
02:45:38,133 --> 02:45:39,758
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3864
02:45:39,759 --> 02:45:42,177
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3865
02:45:42,178 --> 02:45:43,325
Ugh!

3866
02:45:43,388 --> 02:45:46,458
He ever get back to
you about that, um...

3867
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:49,077
About that account?

3868
02:45:54,691 --> 02:45:55,816
You remember.

3869
02:45:55,817 --> 02:45:57,860
It was like 4 or 5 mil,
something like that, right?

3870
02:45:57,861 --> 02:46:01,135
He was supposed
to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?

3871
02:46:05,452 --> 02:46:06,994
Actually, I was...

3872
02:46:06,995 --> 02:46:08,454
I was fucked up,
Jordan,

3873
02:46:08,455 --> 02:46:10,038
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3874
02:46:10,039 --> 02:46:12,141
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3875
02:46:12,709 --> 02:46:14,334
Well, if he calls you,

3876
02:46:14,335 --> 02:46:16,813
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3877
02:46:18,548 --> 02:46:20,299
- Yeah.  Of course.
- Yeah.

3878
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:22,494
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3879
02:46:25,805 --> 02:46:28,408
You gonna eat that last piece
of yellowtail, bud?

3880
02:46:29,350 --> 02:46:31,168
No, it's all yours.

3881
02:46:31,895 --> 02:46:33,338
Can I get this?

3882
02:46:35,732 --> 02:46:37,584
So, what else is...

3883
02:46:40,236 --> 02:46:42,321
Well, how's Naomi
and everything?

3884
02:46:42,322 --> 02:46:43,780
You know how it is.

3885
02:46:43,781 --> 02:46:46,009
She hates my fucking guts.

3886
02:46:47,619 --> 02:46:49,437
How's Hildy? Good?

3887
02:46:50,163 --> 02:46:51,622
She's still alive, so

3888
02:46:51,623 --> 02:46:53,790
my life is fucked, you know?

3889
02:46:53,791 --> 02:46:55,108
Yeah.

3890
02:47:01,799 --> 02:47:03,401
Mr. Jordan.

3891
02:47:03,510 --> 02:47:04,862
Mmm?

3892
02:47:04,969 --> 02:47:07,288
Mr. Jordan,
you got a visitor.

3893
02:47:07,555 --> 02:47:08,702
What?

3894
02:47:09,057 --> 02:47:10,909
You've got a visitor.

3895
02:47:26,324 --> 02:47:28,450
I need you to get dressed.

3896
02:47:28,451 --> 02:47:30,724
Why?
What the fuck's going on?

3897
02:47:35,667 --> 02:47:37,485
You're going to jail.

3898
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:50,681
All right.

3899
02:47:50,682 --> 02:47:52,224
I'll get some clothes on.

3900
02:47:52,225 --> 02:47:54,544
We'll give you a hand with that.

3901
02:48:03,319 --> 02:48:04,466
Okay.

3902
02:48:16,624 --> 02:48:17,941
FBI!

3903
02:48:18,293 --> 02:48:19,835
Everybody sit down.
Put your hands

3904
02:48:19,836 --> 02:48:21,962
where they can be seen,
and shut up!

3905
02:48:21,963 --> 02:48:23,755
Don't you fucking touch me.

3906
02:48:23,756 --> 02:48:25,966
Get your fucking hands off me!

3907
02:48:25,967 --> 02:48:27,785
Don't get out of your seats!

3908
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:42,633
It's fucking Chanel!

3909
02:48:55,204 --> 02:48:57,398
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3910
02:48:57,457 --> 02:48:59,041
<i>And in return,</i>

3911
02:48:59,042 --> 02:49:03,488
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

3912
02:49:05,298 --> 02:49:07,776
<i>Like my pops,
Mad Max, had said,</i>

3913
02:49:08,426 --> 02:49:11,154
<i>"The chickens had
come home to roost."</i>

3914
02:49:12,430 --> 02:49:14,783
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3915
02:49:18,227 --> 02:49:19,603
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3916
02:49:19,604 --> 02:49:21,730
that Mr. Belfort has
distinguished himself

3917
02:49:21,731 --> 02:49:23,899
in terms of his cooperation.

3918
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:26,026
Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions

3919
02:49:26,027 --> 02:49:28,676
of over two dozen
serious offenders

3920
02:49:29,781 --> 02:49:31,782
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3921
02:49:31,783 --> 02:49:35,353
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3922
02:49:37,497 --> 02:49:39,039
The sentence of the
court shall be

3923
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:41,268
36 months in federal prison.

3924
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,188
Please remand the defendant.

3925
02:49:47,298 --> 02:49:49,150
I'm sorry.

3926
02:49:51,928 --> 02:49:53,075
That's okay.

3927
02:50:41,352 --> 02:50:43,895
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3928
02:50:43,896 --> 02:50:45,814
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3929
02:50:45,815 --> 02:50:48,088
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3930
02:50:48,776 --> 02:50:50,193
Belfort, on your feet.

3931
02:50:50,194 --> 02:50:52,592
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3932
02:50:52,739 --> 02:50:55,433
<i>You see, for a brief
fleeting moment,</i>

3933
02:50:56,033 --> 02:50:58,227
<i>I 'd forgotten I was rich.</i>

3934
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:02,645
<i>And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.</i>

3935
02:51:05,084 --> 02:51:07,836
<i>Wouldn't you like to
learn how to sell it?</i>

3936
02:51:07,837 --> 02:51:10,839
<i>So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.</i>

3937
02:51:10,840 --> 02:51:12,257
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,</i>

3938
02:51:12,258 --> 02:51:14,342
<i>professional athletes,
gangsters.</i>

3939
02:51:14,343 --> 02:51:16,219
<i>I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.</i>

3940
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:18,638
<i>But this guy,
my good friend,</i>

3941
02:51:18,639 --> 02:51:21,475
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i>

3942
02:51:21,476 --> 02:51:24,329
baddest motherfucker
I have ever met.

3943
02:51:24,812 --> 02:51:26,605
So I want you right now

3944
02:51:26,606 --> 02:51:29,816
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3945
02:51:29,817 --> 02:51:31,485
for my good friend

3946
02:51:31,486 --> 02:51:34,279
and the world's
greatest sales trainer,

3947
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:35,472
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3948
02:51:47,502 --> 02:51:48,899
Thank you.

3949
02:52:11,734 --> 02:52:13,552
Sell me this pen.

Well, <font color="#FFFFFF">it's a nice</font> pen.

3955
02:52:31,754 --> 02:52:33,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can use the pen</font>

3956
02:52:33,130 --> 02:52:36,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">to write down</font> thoughts
from your life so you can...
