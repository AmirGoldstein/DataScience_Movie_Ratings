00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,021
(Scott) Hello.

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,106
I'm Ridley Scott

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,984
and I'm gonna be talking about Alien,

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:32,531
which was the second film of my
career, which followed The Duellists.

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:38,370
I made this film in the year 1978,
which was released in 1979.

6
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,710
Uh, the title sequence

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:51,091
I invited a very well-known
graphic designer, in fact, designers

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,096
Steve Frankfurt and Richard Greenberg
to come into the...

9
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,057
To help me

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:05,898
where we really were only talking about
the poster and...

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,317
And presswork.

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,821
But when I saw their proposal,
I then asked them if they would come in

13
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,491
to actually get involved
in the title sequences.

14
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,951
Because I always felt title sequences

15
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,206
somehow never echo the artwork
on the poster work.

16
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,249
And my only brief to them was

17
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,880
I kind of wanted a hieroglyphic
that would come up at the beginning.

18
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,008
Because I always wanted
to infer or suggest

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:38,388
that this alien could have been a...

20
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,974
From a sophisticated society.

21
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,353
Obviously not comprehendible by us.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,231
But I think the more sophisticated
we made them,

23
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,066
the more frightening they would be.

24
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,110
And so they came up with what I think

25
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:56,115
is really one of the best title sequences
I've seen in years

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,537
and still have seen in years
since the great Saul Bass.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,330
So...

28
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:10,671
The film was always going to start
in a rather somber, low-key fashion.

29
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,216
And I always remember
having this argument with the...

30
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,301
Some of my colleagues
at that particular time

31
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,387
including the studio,
where they kept saying:

32
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,224
"But nothing happens for 45 minutes."
And I said "Well, that's the whole point."

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,561
Because once it starts to happen,
I think we should have them...

34
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,230
And I think while it's for the...

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,190
If nothing happens
in the first 45 minutes,

36
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,609
it's revealing the world

37
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:38,031
that these workers in space
function in.

38
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,035
And it's very interesting today, in 1 999,

39
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,247
we're now talking about deep-mining
ideas in space.

40
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:51,795
Which, of course, as part of
the description of the Nostromo

41
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:56,884
is in fact involved in just that,
mining in deep space.

42
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,390
So the title sequence continues
to unfold

43
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,603
revealing what is the Nostromo,

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,441
which suggests some kind of freighter,

45
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,029
aircraft carrier, refinery,
where we gradually come

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:23,452
to what would be regarded
as the living quarters.

47
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,038
And I always wanted
to pull off this idea

48
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,791
of that kind of crazy bird in the middle
of the kitchen

49
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,753
which is dipping into water.

50
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,218
Because I was gonna use that later,
just prior to the ex--

51
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:44,139
The Nostromo exploding.
I'll explain that later.

52
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,685
Yeah. We begin really with morning
on this ship.

53
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:53,023
Whatever morning means
in this no-time and no--

54
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,359
No time in space.

55
00:03:55,526 --> 00:04:00,447
But we are witnessing
a spaceship waking up.

56
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:05,452
Or, in fact, be woken up
by its central drive computer,

57
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,954
which we call Mother.

58
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,416
Kubrick had already found a great name
for his computer,

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,001
which was called HAL.

60
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,256
I couldn't think of anything
but to say "mum" or "mother."

61
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:26,181
And the sinister idea of having
the screens reflected in the faces

62
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,268
of what were essentially
emergency helmets,

63
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,853
which are always in position
on the back of two seats,

64
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,690
seemed to be a great way
of opening the film.

65
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,985
I came up with that idea

66
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,239
when I actually saw the set
coming together.

67
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,368
And so the addition of the helmets
talking to each other was late in the day.

68
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,745
But I think it worked pretty well.

69
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,922
Hypersleep, on long stretches

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,177
and probably used as a hospital
when they're all up and about.

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,890
I always thought Jerry's music
here was absolutely -

72
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,144
to use a hackneyed word - poetic.

73
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,856
And when I mixed it,
it always brought a lump to my throat

74
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,107
(chuckles)

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:23,280
on this cue right here.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,707
So there, we're looking at seven babies

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,586
all slumbering, unsuspecting.

78
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,381
I love this piece of score here.
It's fantastic.

79
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,637
Jerry is one of those musicians
who really watches the actors

80
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,393
and reflects what's going on
with the performance.

81
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:59,649
To be totally realistic, I always wanted
all the crew to be stark-naked.

82
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,778
Of course, they would be. if they
were lying in any form of hypersleep,

83
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,615
they would be naked.

84
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,951
But for obvious reasons,
I couldn't do that.

85
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,162
Particularly this first shot.
Because there was

86
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,290
a particularly extraordinary view.

87
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,920
And at one stage, it was--
In the discussion,

88
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,506
I said "Well, the women may as
well be, you know, topless."

89
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,675
Because that's what it is.
I wanted to have a total sense

90
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,721
of reality and rawness
to this whole film.

91
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,016
Which because the realer
and truer you get

92
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,478
then I think the scarier it gets later.

93
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,815
But I lost that argument
for obvious reasons and so...

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,734
I think I remember now.
I did two versions.

95
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,905
And was told I can't use--
I've gotta use the covered-up version.

96
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,494
It's a very nice segue
into them all being up.

97
00:06:53,913 --> 00:07:00,502
And in this mix here,
we're obviously meeting all the characters.

98
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,254
But I wanted it to be,

99
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:08,510
in fact, normal early morning chatter.

100
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,847
Bearing in mind, they've probably been
asleep for 18 months.

101
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,185
And so that's where they're eating
rather uninteresting-looking food

102
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,356
because all the food would actually
have to be the first food to enter--

103
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,152
First real food to enter their bodies
in months.

104
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,533
And this scene also, of course,

105
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:37,122
is introducing the characters,

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,541
the below decks,

107
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,710
which are Harry Dean Stanton
and Yaphet Kotto,

108
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,130
already complaining about their deal.

109
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,632
And we never know
whether that's serious

110
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,112
between who's saying what.
So on the real mix, which was--

111
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,448
Even on the six-track Dolby,

112
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,285
it was quite loud and quite aggressive.

113
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:30,579
That was intentional.

114
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:37,460
And then you have the peace
in the chamber

115
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:43,884
where the captain, Tom Skerritt,

116
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:47,053
wants to find out
why they've been woken up.

117
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,016
Obviously, the sets are designed
for total claustrophobia,

118
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:54,644
with low ceilings and sealed corridors
and sealed chambers.

119
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:59,774
And they were all pretty well four-sided,
the ceilings,

120
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:04,404
and it was quite a kind of task or challenge
for the lighting cameraman

121
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:09,326
who, I think, I believe until recently,
has never done another feature film,

122
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:11,828
but was a great colleague of mine

123
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,623
where we've done many television
commercials together,

124
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,833
called Derek Vanlint.

125
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,628
And I still think that

126
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,424
when you see this in DVD,

127
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:29,012
it will recapture
what the original print was like.

128
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:35,740
And I think Derek
did an absolutely wonderful job.

129
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,467
Then we have a nice connection
with Earth

130
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:12,637
with Sigourney's reference
to Antarctic or Antarctica.

131
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,349
So they're getting close. Probably,

132
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:20,896
uh, many million miles, but still close.

133
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,359
What I thought about this crew
in the way they were characterized

134
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:31,531
is that we were always told
just enough about them.

135
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:35,368
So we knew classically who they were,

136
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,749
who the troublemakers were,
who the politicians were.

137
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:44,795
There was already a class system
with below deck and upper deck.

138
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,839
Jerry Goldsmith was a musician

139
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,927
who is kind of a formidable musician

140
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:58,391
that I approached to see
if he would actually take this onboard.

141
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,728
And he was immediately enthusiastic
about the whole notion,

142
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:06,608
the whole genre and the whole, you
know, description of the atmosphere

143
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:09,194
that I had to verbalize to him
at that point.

144
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:13,073
And I still think, for me,

145
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,952
this is one of the best scores
I've ever been involved with.

146
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,790
It was a real contribution
to the sense of foreboding,

147
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,543
particularly at the beginning of the film.

148
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,964
With the fear, at one point
in the editing process, did not happen--

149
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,216
Nothing happened for 45 minutes.

150
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,719
But I think
Jerry's music sustains the tension.

151
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,098
So that when something
does start to happen,

152
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,351
I think, hopefully,
I think it was successful.

153
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,981
The audience was so sprung-loaded
that the rest was easy. Lt was rock 'n' roll.

154
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,697
Yeah. The casting process was...

155
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:57,826
What I've now discovered,
like all my films, took a long time.

156
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,537
I select very carefully.

157
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,917
Where, eventually,
it's a gut reaction to saying:

158
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:07,669
"It's him" or "It's her."

159
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,840
It's a combination of various things.

160
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:16,011
Obviously, acting capability.
But also it's a physical thing.

161
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,640
And then you're mixing,
putting all these people together.

162
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:24,853
And so the process
took quite a lot of time.

163
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:30,150
Because from a director's angle,
I think, that if you cast right

164
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:31,943
you've got so many other problems

165
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,877
when you're actually
in the process of filming

166
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,225
to turn left, another to right,
the other up, the other down."

167
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:34,437
So he was doing
this incredibly basic lash-up.

168
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:38,566
But I think the end result is just...

169
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,653
Still stands up there. It's really good.

170
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:46,032
We shot and got in close
on the Nostromo.

171
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:51,037
I cheated like hell
because I was giving it atmosphere.

172
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:53,831
I guess they may have gas,
if this would be gas.

173
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,584
It wouldn't be atmosphere.
It might be gaseous.

174
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,338
Here we go. There's a bump.

175
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:02,966
So that's the camera wobbling

176
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,635
and the actors complying
with the wobble.

177
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,012
So I was yanking the camera
all over the place.

178
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,640
I think this is the first time
we get into wobbly cameras

179
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,059
so this precursors rock videos.

180
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:15,061
(chuckles)

181
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,276
The graphic design here
I always thought was great

182
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:23,569
because it wasn't over-designed.

183
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:28,408
If you're in a cockpit now
of a very sophisticated fighter,

184
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,328
it's amazing how basic they are.

185
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,497
And I didn't wanna go into overkill.

186
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:37,917
I wanted it just to feel raw and real.

187
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,046
All this is just the camera...

188
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:47,677
As the Nostromo sinks, it's just
a dolly craning up in a smoke room.

189
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:51,764
So none of this is CGI.
It's all just literally shot.

190
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,933
It always bothered me
that the lights underneath

191
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,060
we couldn't get it in a straight line.

192
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,438
And that drove me crazy,
but eventually we had to shoot.

193
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,064
(laughing]

194
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:06,571
That model there is only four feet long.
But I think that's pretty big.

195
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,119
I always thought the exhausts
were dodgy.

196
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:16,164
So the exhausts are getting blown
by the propellers.

197
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:23,004
I'm trying to get the sense of movement
of the air around it or the gas around it.

198
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,965
But I guess you can buy it.

199
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:30,762
That leg is about a foot across, so...

200
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:35,058
Now the fire here was--

201
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:38,061
Because we were on a pretty
tight schedule on this film, I think

202
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:40,313
total schedule was about 12 weeks.

203
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:45,360
So this fire had to be shot in a day.
It was a real scramble.

204
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:51,157
But with sound effects
and shooting into lights

205
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:54,827
and of course, the actors,

206
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:59,415
I think we conveyed the sense
of chaos. And I love this cut.

207
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:06,422
Straight out of it into "Let's face the music,
and see what kind of trouble we're in."

208
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:11,260
Part of the reality was actually,
you know,

209
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:14,013
in handheld camera shooting the lights
and things like that,

210
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,724
which I'd been doing a lot of
in commercials.

211
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:20,061
And I was always an operator.

212
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:24,482
So I just find operating
is the best job on the floor.

213
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:29,362
And, you know, if you got your eye
on the viewfinder you know you've got it.

214
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,117
Now we have video assist
and therefore, it's less necessary

215
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:38,037
but I still love the process of operating.

216
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:40,915
You can invent while you're doing it.

217
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:47,380
And I was always told in the early days
"Actors don't like it if you operate."

218
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,549
Well, this is not true, I've discovered.

219
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:54,470
In fact, there seems to be
a stronger camaraderie

220
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,598
and a closer contact

221
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,352
because they feel that you're
really, really watching them.

222
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,690
And the connection is very strong
when you're operating.

223
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,403
Again, a great cut from

224
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:15,074
this deafening roar,
which on six-track Dolby is deafening,

225
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:19,996
to almost an ear-popping,
air-conditioned silence.

226
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:22,081
When you're looking...

227
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,209
When you come into the cockpit
and she's...

228
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:30,590
And Veronica is reflectively looking out

229
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,676
at this unfriendly planet,

230
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,970
it's almost as if she knows something.

231
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:41,225
You feel that she is sensing
that this is not gonna be a good trip.

232
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,819
I love Tom Skerritt's laid-back quality.

233
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:59,619
When he could play this as a noisy,
you know, aggressive, macho pilot.

234
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:01,370
But in fact, he's...

235
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,539
He's actually almost like Chuck Yeager.

236
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,124
(chuckles)

237
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:12,381
Very interesting alphanumerics,
gobbledygook

238
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,719
we put on a green and yellow screen
rather than black.

239
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,141
And all this stuff here, where they...

240
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:27,813
You've gotta have LAN Holm
as the geologist

241
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:34,529
speculating on the mysterious
chemistry of the planet.

242
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,615
Great stuff. Great acting.

243
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:46,832
There's a little shot
where we see the scale of the nose

244
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,793
and we see her walk across
in the window.

245
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:52,380
The first sign here

246
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,426
that Ian isn't necessarily
what you think he is.

247
00:21:57,594 --> 00:22:00,137
Is he arthritic, or is it something else?

248
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:04,141
Or is it years in space have got
to his joints?

249
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,310
So that was a little...

250
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:10,189
That was a little suggestion by him
which I thought was great.

251
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:11,691
I said "What a great idea."

252
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:16,362
So there you have an actor really thinking
through the whole idea

253
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,198
and getting in to the notion
of the realities

254
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:23,244
of science fact and not science fiction.

255
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,048
I love this cockpit.
Somehow it's very fascist.

256
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:43,723
This shot here, actually, is three children
made in miniature spacesuits that we--

257
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,603
Who were my two sons
and the cameraman's son.

258
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:54,150
I had small costumes made for them
so the landing legs look bigger.

259
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:58,029
So if that was an adult,
those legs would look half the size.

260
00:22:58,196 --> 00:22:59,864
But they're children, overcramped.

261
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:10,750
This was shot direct link down below
and a camera up on the monitor.

262
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:14,962
And I'm blowing vermiculite
through the air, which hurt like hell.

263
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,257
So I had to wear goggles
and breathing mask

264
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:22,595
because vermiculite is basically
chipped up teeny bits of plastic.

265
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:37,318
The idea of making the hero a heroine,

266
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:39,445
I think, was a master stroke

267
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:43,491
because we truly expect Sigourney
probably to be the first one to go.

268
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,284
And of course, the story is different.

269
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:56,337
We had a whole armory of CO2

270
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:59,298
because, of course, any scientist
would look at this and say:

271
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:01,550
"What the hell
have they got CO2 there for?"

272
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:06,472
But I just liked it.
So here we use CO2 for the first time.

273
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,600
And he switches it off.
Just a great dramatic end to the scene.

274
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:15,578
Sigourney was great
because she has such

275
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:19,182
with fresh meat

276
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,811
which was the lacework you see
there, called Nottingham lace

277
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:29,943
which is basically the skin
from the stomach of a cow

278
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,904
which when they pull it off
in the slaughterhouse

279
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:36,658
you have this beautiful
filigree of lace

280
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,701
which is lining the stomach.

281
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,329
So we laid that over the top.

282
00:35:41,497 --> 00:35:45,500
And then the thing that snaps up
and hits him in the face

283
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,419
is an intestine of a sheep

284
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:51,548
which has all been steamed clean
and immaculate.

285
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,008
Just put an air line on it, it just went:

286
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:57,428
I used to have rubber gloves on,
a white coat

287
00:35:57,596 --> 00:36:00,515
and I had to dress it for every shot.

288
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:02,016
I felt like a surgeon.

289
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:06,187
And then the air line went on and, bang,
and it, you know, works.

290
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:10,066
I guess if you spend
a lot of time together in space

291
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,735
the camaraderie
will gradually disappear

292
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:17,657
and each person will become isolated
with their own thoughts

293
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:21,202
and their own memories
of where they've been

294
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,162
and where they're going to.

295
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,542
And therefore,
all of the characters are designed

296
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:31,879
as not really being comrades.

297
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:35,967
There's a kind of cold relationship
amongst all of them.

298
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,886
And an interesting point
is that at the end of the film

299
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:46,060
Sigourney does
the extraordinary thing

300
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,354
of going back for a cat.

301
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:51,608
Well, maybe her only real relationship
on the spaceship is the cat.

302
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:58,156
So Sigourney, here, you see an officer
wanting to go by the book

303
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:01,743
even countermanding
the wishes of her captain.

304
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,663
So she's now taking over
and she's being right to do so.

305
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:09,417
If only they'd just stayed with it,
there would've been no problem.

306
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:16,174
This always spooked
the audience totally.

307
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:19,010
The very simple thing that

308
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:25,850
the tail of the facehugger
tightens on the man's neck.

309
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,105
That's my favorite reaction in the movie.

310
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:32,315
(laughs)

311
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,525
"My God." And there it is.

312
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:44,135
Now, that's just a rubber tail
with a bit of liner, we just pulled it tight.

313
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,017
This particular set here

314
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:21,107
where Ron Cobb had done a lot of
visuals of the interior of the Nostromo

315
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:26,988
and I would say, this is one
of the most realistic and beautifuI

316
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:32,160
pieces of technology I've seen,
you know.

317
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,206
Well, you know, I think the best
technology ever presented probably

318
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,791
was in 2001, Stanley Kubrick.

319
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:43,630
And so it was very difficult
because Stanley had done that

320
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:47,383
and it was and still is
one of my favorite films.

321
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:52,430
If I had to say, what are your 20 favorite
films, that would have to be in there.

322
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:58,520
And therefore, it was tricky not to get
influenced by what he had done

323
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:03,149
and, of course, what he had done,
I think A, had worked closely

324
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:10,323
with finding out what NASA
speculative designs were or would be.

325
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,367
So when you think about 2001

326
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,621
and you look at what's happening
today, he's still ahead of the game.

327
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,210
And so we have to avoid that at all cost

328
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:27,257
but inevitably, it's fair to say
I was very much influenced by 2001.

329
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,744
Boy, that's effective.
I forgot how effective that was.

330
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:03,126
Now that's just polystyrene
on a fairly potent acid

331
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,422
and it sure goes through there fast,
but it looks like...

332
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,427
I thought it was a great,
subtle way of saying

333
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,097
that this thing is indestructible
and has gone through metal.

334
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,267
Burnt through a boot.

335
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,473
It's interesting to note here
that the full realization

336
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,101
that there might be trouble here

337
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,895
is that you get a sense

338
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,608
that they are beginning to work
together for the first time

339
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,403
rather than being aggressive
with each other

340
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,238
and unreceptive.

341
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,957
Bit of Irving the Explainer.

342
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,675
(Dallas) Here's your pen back.

343
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,218
(Scott) Nice humorous moment.

344
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,095
(laughs)

345
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,722
And, of course, Harry's up next.

346
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,479
Here we are in the engine room.

347
00:42:54,279 --> 00:43:00,702
I liked a lot of the Sizzle Rocks,
which I used for lightning.

348
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:08,418
So it's introducing a lot of familiar stuff
but in unfamiliar surroundings,

349
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,795
like the CO2.

350
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:27,562
The technology of the spacecraft
doesn't stand too close scrutiny. Heh.

351
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:07,591
I made this hand-held because
of the slight movement

352
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,512
which again, you're wanting
to make an audience uneasy.

353
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,723
They know it's in there somewhere

354
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,183
and they don't know what to expect.

355
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,019
Because even when a film comes out

356
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:22,106
and people get the heat from the movie
and they wanna see it,

357
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,608
they still don't know
where it's gonna happen,

358
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:28,612
so this could be the scene.

359
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,949
It scares the hell out of them.

360
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,244
But I think we now had
enough tension going.

361
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:42,001
I was trying to work out a shock
on that day and we couldn't, so...

362
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,671
That's a cheap shock.

363
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,881
(laughs)

364
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,591
But it worked.

365
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,644
And I always felt this was a bit artificial
that nothing really happened

366
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,938
and yet on reflection, actually,
it was good

367
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,108
because there was worse to come.

368
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,200
It's worth mentioning the soundman
on this, Jimmy Shields.

369
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,454
You'll notice that light even has a sound,
right?

370
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,665
So if you listen to the track

371
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,171
you'll hear all these kinds of weird
and wonderful, very subtle sounds.

372
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,342
In fact, I did,
I think four, five films with Jimmy.

373
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,761
He's still going strong.

374
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,644
That's the corner you expect
and then it drops.

375
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,690
That's-- That's as good
as we could do on the day.

376
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,527
And all we could do
is have the propman drop it.

377
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,991
So you're convinced that something's
gonna happen to LAN here.

378
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,535
Of course it's not.

379
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,870
Good shot.

380
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,339
Now, the interior of this thing,
we made a rubber case

381
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,176
and the inside of it there
is all shellfish.

382
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:19,682
They are, on the surface there,
they are oysters, clams.

383
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,185
So there's oysters and clams, all fresh.

384
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,188
Hence, yeah, every morning
we'd have a bucket of oysters and clams.

385
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,483
I'd just put them in with tweezers
and just dress it.

386
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,902
(chuckles)

387
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,199
But it kind of looks real, but is real.

388
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,503
I like the three heads in this.

389
00:50:49,671 --> 00:51:00,014
I like Dallas' stare.
Absolutely staring in silence at it.

390
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:27,096
And we hit the breakfast scene before
they're gonna go back into hypersleep.

391
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,391
In fact, they'd probably be eating food
in special preparation.

392
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,561
So that once they're in the hypersleep,
they would,

393
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:39,900
to be graphic, secrete or lose the food
to become a liquid form.

394
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:58,001
This is a good scene
to hear Jimmy Shields' sound effects.

395
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,381
You can hear a hum

396
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,176
which rises and falls,
which is always there.

397
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,721
Something is always there,
which makes you uneasy.

398
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,184
Because the sounds were almost organic.

399
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,436
Jimmy used a lot of organic sounds.

400
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,698
Okay, here's the famous scene.

401
00:55:32,036 --> 00:55:34,538
I think most of that food in there
was muesli.

402
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:48,010
A little look from Ian there
as the kind of doctor on the board.

403
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:53,307
He's still watching him closely because
obviously he doesn't believe it's gone away.

404
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,899
Dirty joke from Yaphet.

405
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,817
(laughs)

406
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,236
Here it goes.

407
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:17,539
Well, I didn't ever show them what
would come out. They never saw that.

408
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,417
And we did all this in one take.

409
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:25,422
But with five or was it four cameras?
With all the air lines prepared.

410
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,594
So once he's on the table,
it's all preset to go.

411
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,264
So all this is kind of one camera.

412
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,602
And he starts to thrash.

413
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,406
It's all hand-held. And then you go to...

414
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,576
He starts to spasm.

415
00:56:55,828 --> 00:57:02,000
Boom. That's an air line inside his chest,
inside his vest.

416
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,004
Now he's going into a spasm frenzy.

417
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,178
Wow, that's pretty good.

418
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,889
(laughing)

419
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,810
That's pretty heavy.

420
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:23,897
Listen to the sounds.

421
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,611
It's a baby.

422
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,780
It's a boy.

423
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,532
And I had to have a little railway track
across the table to get rid of it.

424
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,804
for such eventualities.

425
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:22,933
And therefore they're having to use
and adapt materials

426
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:27,062
and lash up weapons

427
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,901
including flamethrowers
to hunt and protect this thing.

428
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,404
Of course, at this moment
they think it's tiny.

429
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:43,703
But with this exotic biomechanoid,
he's growing as they speak.

430
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,374
(Ash) Micro changes in air density.

431
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,917
(Scott) Good answer.

432
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,836
(chuckles)

433
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,239
Dallas is always very cool.

434
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,618
Yaphet, who's always great,
is the troublemaker onboard the ship.

435
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,914
And the day that Yaphet had to die,
he said "I'm not gonna die."

436
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,241
The cat was the only witness.

437
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,828
I think Veronica

438
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:52,919
starts to evoke a more fragile
human spirit who's now terrified.

439
01:08:54,755 --> 01:09:00,510
And she's got the first sense
of the reality of the situation

440
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,054
that they're really in trouble.

441
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,856
So this is suggesting
they saw something.

442
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:15,441
It was better not to see it.

443
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,530
And Ash saying "Kane's son"

444
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,074
is very interesting.

445
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,452
Because the whole notion of this,
you know,

446
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,789
was taken off a certain type of insect

447
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:35,503
that will find a host for its eggs.

448
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,798
And then in that host,
which could be another insect,

449
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,299
a grub, preferably,

450
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:45,930
it will bury its eggs and then, of course,
the eggs will grow and consume the host.

451
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:48,182
So that's the logic of it all.

452
01:12:43,358 --> 01:12:46,777
So then we get repetition
of the same set.

453
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:49,155
So there we get a sense
of a whole complex.

454
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:57,038
Of course, this is where
the sound mix is great

455
01:12:57,205 --> 01:13:00,499
because you give a sense
of the cavernous

456
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:05,546
interiors of all these tubes.

457
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,883
A lot of reverb on Dallas' voice.

458
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,470
Again, we keep shooting
the same ladder and the same tube.

459
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,306
It's an exercise in using the same set
many times.

460
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:28,694
The first time I see Dallas
bothered in the film.

461
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:31,781
This is where he starts to feel
that he's in trouble.

462
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,080
There you get a panicked reaction.

463
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:46,504
It's an interesting scene here,
because somehow

464
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,341
Tom really makes the audience

465
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,929
feel put in the same situation.

466
01:13:58,558 --> 01:14:00,893
And we know he's gonna die.

467
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,562
Now it's inevitable.

468
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:09,694
And you get a sense of his feeling
of panic as well, which is wonderful.

469
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:19,328
And Ash waits for the inevitable.

470
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:34,844
Oddly enough, that was a sequence
that we weren't really prepared for

471
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:38,597
because we didn't really have
what I thought was enough of a set.

472
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:42,184
But again,
when you're forced to be inventive...

473
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,564
Yeah, you know, the best comes out of it.
It works very well.

474
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,736
We had a scene in between this

475
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:55,948
which was a scene
between Sigourney comforting

476
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:02,413
a terrorized Veronica,

477
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:06,375
who was really the first member
of the crew

478
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,294
to begin to lose it.

479
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,254
And also, it's a very important scene

480
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:14,800
because this is where Sigourney
now is in charge.

481
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,470
She's next in command.
She's taken over from Dallas.

482
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,433
And also, it's a proving scene
for Sigourney

483
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:28,230
because you have Ash,
you have Yaphet Kotto,

484
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:33,569
who are obviously wondering
whether they can trust her judgment.

485
01:15:36,364 --> 01:15:38,699
I remember shooting this

486
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,874
and I remember talking to Yaphet
and saying to Yaphet,

487
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:51,420
which is a little unfair,
to wind up Sigourney.

488
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,172
And keep interrupting her.

489
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:58,260
And it was really great because
she established her authority.

490
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,304
(laughs)

491
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:11,148
So I think you have a very good
takeover here by Sigourney.

492
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:31,450
I filled the Nostromo with all these toys

493
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:34,661
from the various gift shops
around the universe

494
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,955
wherever they'd stopped off.

495
01:20:37,248 --> 01:20:39,333
And that's what these little toys were.

496
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:43,378
I always figure that wherever you go,
there will be gift shops.

497
01:20:43,546 --> 01:20:45,339
So that's where...

498
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,592
That's how the Hawaiian shirt appeared.

499
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,678
That's how the dipping bird appeared.

500
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:54,431
That's the toys.

501
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,983
I guess this is the closest thing
to seeing a robot have sex.

502
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,954
I need to have some show of strength,

503
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,124
which was simple, but violent.

504
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:33,220
And I think here comes
one of the really great ideas in the film

505
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:37,391
which is having this character onboard
that you had no idea what he was.

506
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,227
And here, it's to be revealed.

507
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,855
And it also makes sense.

508
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,066
If you have interests,
financial interest like this,

509
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,653
you gotta have something onboard
to make sure that you are protected.

510
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,448
So he's like a walking transmitter.

511
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:02,708
You hear the death of Ash
and the winding down the...

512
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,043
Whatever is driving him.

513
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,921
It's Jimmy Shields' great sounds.

514
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:32,029
A lot with this stuff
we had to make up on the day, virtually.

515
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,324
So we couldn't work out how to kill Ash.

516
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,803
Great voice.

517
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,389
Yeah, we worked on that forever,

518
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:43,809
trying to find out what would
the voice be of this dying robot.

519
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,024
It almost has a Doppler effect.

520
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,071
Spooky.

521
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,415
This was a speech about--

522
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:10,752
A really doomy speech
about the indestructibility of it

523
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,756
and the perfection of what they had,
what they were against.

524
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,762
And this was a scene
that was written during photography.

525
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,932
We were never happy
about the dialogue that we had.

526
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,102
And I think David had to work on this
incessantly

527
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,439
as we were headed
towards the actual day.

528
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:35,068
I think we came up with the words
that morning. Or David did.

529
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,783
(Ash) I admire its purity.

530
01:24:45,496 --> 01:24:47,873
A survivor,

531
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,083
unclouded

532
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,835
(Scott) "Unclouded."

533
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,589
(Ash) by conscience, remorse,

534
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,924
or delusions of morality.

535
01:24:58,092 --> 01:24:59,968
(Scott) Kind of a great speech.

536
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:13,982
(Ash)
I can't lie to you about your chances, but...

537
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,653
(Scott) Mm. Great. That's a pretty tough
piece of information at that point.

538
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:20,614
(laughs)

539
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:29,915
So now we're in a really,

540
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,752
I think, terrifying situation.

541
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:40,509
Because big, tough Yaphet
had suddenly got these two women

542
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,430
as part of his defense group.

543
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,141
So, boy, he must have been feeling
really vulnerable.

544
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,190
There's so much you do
which you keep simple

545
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:58,026
you know, the head on the table,
you could have gone crazy

546
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,070
with all kinds of stuff underneath it.

547
01:28:30,374 --> 01:28:33,168
I think most of the audience were
convinced that the cat had an alien,

548
01:28:35,254 --> 01:28:36,546
the next alien inside it.

549
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:44,929
There's even low-key light levels,
it's very tricky.

550
01:28:45,973 --> 01:28:48,183
Because we're pretty well wide open
on spherical.

551
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:49,517
Oh, I'm sorry. Anamorphic.

552
01:28:50,519 --> 01:28:53,605
And it's sort of
a little bit of out of focus there.

553
01:28:54,732 --> 01:28:56,733
It just shows how few takes I was doing.

554
01:28:56,901 --> 01:28:58,902
At this point,
I was running against the gun.

555
01:29:01,322 --> 01:29:04,532
Great keynote.
You got a great cue coming in.

556
01:29:09,372 --> 01:29:11,706
And, of course, here

557
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:16,419
I wanted to promote the idea
that Sigourney was next.

558
01:29:20,549 --> 01:29:24,886
Which is a pretty obvious thing
to be doing at this point.

559
01:29:25,054 --> 01:29:28,223
You wanna put her in direct jeopardy.

560
01:29:31,769 --> 01:29:34,437
And I was always concerned
about would the audience think:

561
01:29:34,605 --> 01:29:37,065
"Why the hell is she going back
for the cat?"

562
01:29:37,233 --> 01:29:38,775
But nobody seemed to question it.

563
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:41,069
Shows we've got a bunch
of animal lovers out there.

564
01:29:49,995 --> 01:29:53,248
She touched the seat button.
That's what made the seat fly forward.

565
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:55,333
A cheap thrill.

566
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:00,046
But that's what this kind of genre needs
is you've gotta keep coming up

567
01:30:00,214 --> 01:30:04,759
with original ways of keeping,
sustaining the tension.

568
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:12,517
And that cat...

569
01:30:13,269 --> 01:30:16,938
That cry of the cat,
again, was laid in deliberately

570
01:30:17,106 --> 01:30:21,860
to promote the idea that
"Was the cat impregnated?"

571
01:30:22,027 --> 01:30:28,616
I wanted the alien to have a certain
kind of fascination and delicacy,

572
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:35,165
like this massive toy coming towards her,
which was mesmerizing.

573
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:41,588
And I put this music up for her,
which seemed to help her.

574
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:49,471
So, in fact, when I got into the Nostromo
and into the shuttle also at the end,

575
01:30:49,638 --> 01:30:53,641
I lined the side of the set
with 15-inch speakers

576
01:30:53,809 --> 01:30:55,268
and I played Tomita

577
01:30:56,771 --> 01:31:03,067
in the shuttle, absolutely full bore.

578
01:31:03,235 --> 01:31:06,696
So rather than a silent set
and me shouting "Action!"

579
01:31:06,864 --> 01:31:12,243
and Sigourney rushing around
in silence,

580
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:14,370
I said "Do you want some assistance?"

581
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,331
She said "Yeah."

582
01:31:16,499 --> 01:31:18,333
I said "Listen to this." Bumm.

583
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:22,045
And I had The Planets by Tomita.

584
01:31:22,213 --> 01:31:26,508
And she liked that.
Because then it helped her...

585
01:31:26,675 --> 01:31:29,511
It just helped her to have

586
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:31,805
that massive orchestration around
and it was--

587
01:31:31,972 --> 01:31:34,182
We had it right up. Yeah.

588
01:31:37,186 --> 01:31:40,855
And, of course,
making Sigourney a very lonely figure.

589
01:31:42,024 --> 01:31:44,984
She can hear the death

590
01:31:45,945 --> 01:31:47,737
rather than see the death
of the other two.

591
01:31:54,036 --> 01:31:55,703
Her death is heard.

592
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:04,128
And it's probably more frightening
by hearing it rather than seeing it.

593
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:12,220
That was a tough session
in the looping stage

594
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:16,224
trying to get that kind of scream.

595
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:43,084
I think what we managed to do
in the film here

596
01:32:43,252 --> 01:32:47,380
is always put the audience in the place
of the individual about to die.

597
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:50,258
So I think we somehow
touched on something

598
01:32:50,426 --> 01:32:55,096
which makes the audience very
vulnerable to what's occurring

599
01:32:55,264 --> 01:32:58,975
which, I think,
is why it's particularly frightening.

600
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:14,532
So the invention
of how do you blow up a refinery

601
01:33:15,618 --> 01:33:19,662
is, you know, tricky
and should be complex.

602
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:23,207
But, also, it's enormously frustrating.

603
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:26,252
It almost meant at this point
to be kind of almost humorous.

604
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,963
Here you are trying to read
an instruction book

605
01:33:29,131 --> 01:33:31,674
at the time when you're
about to meet your maker.

606
01:33:32,718 --> 01:33:36,346
And there's one of the fuses
that I've got in the office

607
01:33:36,513 --> 01:33:38,723
which Nicky gave to me
at the end of the movie.

608
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:39,974
I've got this column.

609
01:33:43,395 --> 01:33:46,814
Nothing could be done by mistake here.
This has gotta be very deliberate.

610
01:33:46,982 --> 01:33:50,151
So in a way, it's like a one-sided,
one-man way

611
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:52,487
of being able to set off
an atomic bomb.

612
01:34:13,592 --> 01:34:15,857
There she hits the corridor.

613
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:05,878
Now she's gonna come back
and switch off the power.

614
01:38:08,006 --> 01:38:10,466
But she's passed the point of no return.

615
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:13,219
This is one of our big miniatures,
the engine room.

616
01:38:22,896 --> 01:38:29,068
When you get this played full bore,
it's pretty intense actually.

617
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:32,905
And interesting to see that, I think
it's the last 17 minutes of the film,

618
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:38,744
there is no dialogue except for
utterances of Sigourney to herself.

619
01:38:44,918 --> 01:38:47,420
Now you've got the emergency thing
really kicking in.

620
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:06,981
You get this going six-track Dolby,
big sound,

621
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:08,482
it's a great mix.

622
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,116
And now she's gotta go all the way back.
And they always wanted to cut this down.

623
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,786
And I said no.
You know, you've gotta show...

624
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:24,457
That flapping door there,
there was actually a guy standing there

625
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:25,791
trying to hide the light.

626
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,755
And they wanted to cut it out.
I said "No, leave it in."

627
01:39:30,922 --> 01:39:36,844
There's actually a guy there.

628
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:48,160
In fact, it's kind of silly
because with an explosion like that

629
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,787
there would be nothing left.

630
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:52,540
But why it explodes three times,
it's just better.

631
01:42:52,707 --> 01:42:54,667
Three's always better.

632
01:42:57,254 --> 01:42:59,672
There you go. I knew there was three.

633
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,091
And a firestorm.

634
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:05,261
A bit dodgy, but kind of good.
Considering it's just artwork.

635
01:43:05,428 --> 01:43:08,806
That was, I think, actually,
that was a little bit of slit-scan.

636
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:10,933
Great cue.

637
01:43:11,601 --> 01:43:12,768
Here's the cue.

638
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:15,104
Now you know you're in trouble.

639
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,107
(Ripley) I got you...

640
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,317
(Scott) "Got you, you son of a bitch."

641
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:22,611
(Ripley) ..you son of a bitch.

642
01:43:22,779 --> 01:43:24,947
(Scott) Now you know you're in trouble.

643
01:43:31,413 --> 01:43:35,499
I think the music now, as dialogue,
is telling you it's not over.

644
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,046
Hit it a little bit. There.

645
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,972
So now we're tense again.

646
01:43:58,648 --> 01:44:03,360
I love that cut to the cat.
This little squeal of the cat.

647
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:07,698
And you think, you're convinced
it has to be the cat, I think, correct?

648
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:13,120
Cos don't forget,
we've invested in earlier shots

649
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:16,373
of the cat wandering off by itself

650
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:19,752
and then the alien looking down
in the box.

651
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,339
In fact, now, looking at this,
I would almost put the box...

652
01:44:23,506 --> 01:44:27,384
Put the cat in it
before I go into the cockpit.

653
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:30,095
So then you think,
A, the alien's in the cockpit,

654
01:44:30,263 --> 01:44:33,307
B, what did it do the cat?

655
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,692
Is that satisfaction or is it threat?

656
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:48,530
I wanted these hypersleeps to be,
eventually, for the end of the film...

657
01:44:48,698 --> 01:44:51,033
I wanted her to be Sleeping Beauty.

658
01:44:56,581 --> 01:45:01,710
Now, when you lose the music,
funnily enough, it gets more tense.

659
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:07,049
And the actual sound effects gets,
I think, even more scary.

660
01:45:07,717 --> 01:45:10,761
So you wonder what the hell is going on.

661
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:15,557
They kept saying
"There's no sex in this movie."

662
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:17,184
I said "Well, you don't need any.

663
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:19,895
But there's a good opportunity here

664
01:45:20,063 --> 01:45:25,734
to have a little bit of, you know,
hinted-at sexuality."

665
01:45:25,944 --> 01:45:30,364
And Sigourney is certainly the person
to project that.

666
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:38,539
And, like, in these films,
what's interesting?

667
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:44,336
And now, I think about it
but then nobody else does.

668
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:47,715
She just lets...

669
01:45:47,882 --> 01:45:50,718
She just lost six colleagues.

670
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:58,892
And she's going into mode of
"How do I get out of here?" All right?

671
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:02,104
"How do I put myself into a position
where I'm gonna reach Earth?

672
01:46:02,272 --> 01:46:04,773
And maybe the network
will pick me up."

673
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:08,027
And nobody ever raised that question.

674
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:12,573
I do, but I thought
"Well, if it's not broke..."

675
01:46:12,741 --> 01:46:14,575
You know, "If it's not broken,
don't fix it."

676
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:17,119
Otherwise, you're gonna have
a serious psychological blitz

677
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:23,500
as she, you know, collapses mentally
because she's lost six colleagues.

678
01:47:03,666 --> 01:47:09,129
Oddly enough,
there's a sensuality to this whole scene.

679
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:13,342
Partly the silence.

680
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:19,348
It's subtly sexual, right?

681
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:20,891
Or is it just me?

682
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:22,559
(chuckles)

683
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:38,325
This is a tough shoot.

684
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:41,120
Inside a tiny, teeny cupboard.

685
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:45,791
And it's even tougher. How the hell
do you get the helmet to go on one...?

686
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,210
And Nickie just did it.

687
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:52,714
We just put the helmet on as it hit,
the lights went on inside the helmet.

688
01:47:52,882 --> 01:47:56,510
And you just make a sound of an airlock
and you got the helmet on.

689
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,971
Economy.

690
01:48:22,745 --> 01:48:24,788
There it is, watch.

691
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,917
Simple.

692
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,091
Beautiful helmets. Now, we used
the same suits as the planet

693
01:48:36,259 --> 01:48:39,052
and all we did was recycle
and spray them white.

694
01:48:45,935 --> 01:48:48,312
Tried to think of something
other than a laser gun

695
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:53,442
or, you know, of a weapon.
I thought a harpoon.

696
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:56,737
So they're saying "A harpoon?
What would she use a harpoon for?"

697
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,406
I said "Docking?"

698
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:03,076
"And like a safety thing
in case something..."

699
01:49:03,244 --> 01:49:05,662
It's like a safety--
Piece of a safety equipment.

700
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:09,791
So I thought because a harpoon
is more lethal somehow and more...

701
01:49:09,959 --> 01:49:12,628
You know, a gun is too easy.

702
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:21,303
You know, this is Sigourney's idea.

703
01:49:21,471 --> 01:49:26,141
She kept saying "I wanna sing
'You Are My Lucky Star."'

704
01:49:26,309 --> 01:49:30,812
I'd like to keep myself concentrating.

705
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:34,942
And not thinking about the worst
that could possibly happen.

706
01:49:35,276 --> 01:49:41,740
So we did it on the day and then there
was this big rush to get the clearance on it.

707
01:49:45,995 --> 01:49:51,124
I love the lighting in here
because it's very harsh in a way,

708
01:49:51,292 --> 01:49:53,210
but beautiful.

709
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:02,636
And shooting this
with the strobes going,

710
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:06,974
you're getting a, obviously,
stroboscopic effect on the alien.

711
01:50:07,141 --> 01:50:09,601
So he's kind of jumping.

712
01:50:10,186 --> 01:50:12,729
Because I think in the strobe,
you're losing some frames.

713
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:16,566
It's an illusion but I think it helped.

714
01:50:16,734 --> 01:50:19,444
I love that as you see him slither out
from the wall.

715
01:50:19,612 --> 01:50:22,531
Once it's humanoid, it's spooky.

716
01:50:23,866 --> 01:50:27,536
They say you don't see enough of the alien,
I think you see plenty of the alien.

717
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:30,455
And besides, he is humanoid.

718
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:34,126
Because if the alien
had originally jumped on the cat,

719
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:39,131
then the alien
would've been a version of the cat.

720
01:50:39,507 --> 01:50:41,133
And so on.

721
01:51:02,905 --> 01:51:05,157
All these things
would've been done now CGI.

722
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,534
But they're tough to do physically,
you know?

723
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,369
This is all physical.

724
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:15,417
So Roy Scammell was the stuntman

725
01:51:16,377 --> 01:51:19,254
who fell on elastic
and then got pulled back up.

726
01:51:19,422 --> 01:51:22,716
There's the water effect
of the engines going on,

727
01:51:22,884 --> 01:51:24,718
which I thought
was particularly successful.

728
01:51:24,886 --> 01:51:27,763
Particularly there, that's like...
They say "What is that?"

729
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:31,141
And I say "Well, you know,
it's a plasma engine, of course."

730
01:51:31,309 --> 01:51:32,601
(chuckles)

731
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:34,269
Then you cut him loose and let him drop.

732
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:37,689
And he just clipped me, nearly knocked
me out when they dropped him.

733
01:51:37,857 --> 01:51:42,069
And this shot,
oddly enough, was spherical.

734
01:51:42,236 --> 01:51:44,946
We had to do it for a technical reason,
but I left it spherical

735
01:51:45,114 --> 01:51:47,949
so you have a distortion
on the body of the lens.

736
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:53,163
There, particularly. That's beautiful.

737
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:34,329
Love these repetitions.

738
01:52:34,497 --> 01:52:37,332
And this is Howard Hanson music.

739
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:41,837
And one of the reasons
it really works beautifully,

740
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,840
apart from going with the voice,

741
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:50,095
goes into a hold in a second.

742
01:52:51,013 --> 01:52:52,639
Beautiful.

743
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,475
Here.

744
01:52:56,769 --> 01:52:59,729
I love that holding pattern.

745
01:53:03,526 --> 01:53:07,279
Interesting, after a film like that,
you end it on virtual silence.

746
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:14,661
The production designer on this
was Michael Seymour,

747
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:17,205
an old colleague of mine
from television commercials.

748
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:19,749
And who the...

749
01:53:19,917 --> 01:53:26,089
Who had invited two young art directors
at that particular point to assist him.

750
01:53:26,257 --> 01:53:28,049
Roger Christian assisted him

751
01:53:28,217 --> 01:53:32,471
with the look of and the construction
of the spaceship Nostromo.

752
01:53:32,638 --> 01:53:35,640
And Roger Christian is now a director
and has been for a number of years.

753
01:53:35,808 --> 01:53:39,186
And Les Dilley was in charge
of everything to do with the alien.

754
01:53:39,353 --> 01:53:45,942
And therefore,
he would carry out Giger's drawings.

755
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:49,070
Remarkable drawings.
And transfer that--

756
01:53:49,238 --> 01:53:52,407
Translate those drawings
into these giant sets

757
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:55,494
which, in itself, is a task.

758
01:53:55,661 --> 01:53:59,206
There's a big leap
between a drawing and a set.

759
01:53:59,373 --> 01:54:05,837
Where it looks real and looks,
I should say, viscerally real

760
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:09,007
rather than just like a rendition
of a drawing.

761
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:10,717
It can easily fall apart

762
01:54:10,885 --> 01:54:16,598
between the art
and the final construction.

763
01:54:37,995 --> 01:54:40,455
Yeah, I mean, it was a...

764
01:54:41,415 --> 01:54:46,711
I think I'd been pretty well used to
a lot of filmmaking at this point

765
01:54:46,879 --> 01:54:50,507
through advertising
and then a film like The Duellists.

766
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:53,677
So I knew the best.

767
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:56,471
I knew I needed the best.

768
01:54:57,765 --> 01:55:00,642
Because I'm very demanding

769
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:04,145
and at the same time,
I think I'm easy to work with.

770
01:55:04,313 --> 01:55:07,649
And the whole thing, you know, when you
put a good bunch of people together,

771
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:09,901
it becomes all very inspirational.

772
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:15,824
And I think above all things, if it's not fun,
you shouldn't be doing it, you know.

773
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:20,495
So I love the process
of filmmaking and

774
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:25,250
thank God
I'm able to continue making movies.

775
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:27,419
(chuckles)
