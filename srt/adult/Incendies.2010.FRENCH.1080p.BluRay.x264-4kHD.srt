1
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,670
Good to see you.

2
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,430
Please...

3
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,930
THE TWINS

4
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,750
"Will of Mrs. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,500
"Opening of the will
before her two children,

6
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,300
"Simon Marwan

7
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,590
"and Jeanne Marwan.

8
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,850
"In conformance with the instructions
and rights of Mrs. Nawal Marwan,

9
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,850
"Notary Jean Lebel

10
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,810
"is named executor of the will."

11
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,070
That was your mother's decision.

12
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,940
I was against it, but she insisted.

13
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,070
You know,

14
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,370
your mother was more than an employee.

15
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,120
My late wife and I
considered you our family.

16
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,370
So...

17
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,090
I couldn't refuse.

18
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,590
"All my assets are divided between
the twins Jeanne and Simon.

19
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,470
"My money will be halved

20
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,850
"and my belongings divided as they see fit.

21
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,890
"Burial.

22
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,350
"To Notary Jean Lebel,

23
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,320
"bury me with no casket, no prayers, naked,

24
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,740
"face down, away from the world.

25
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,410
"Stone and epitaph.

26
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,660
"I want no gravestone,
nor my name engraved anywhere.

27
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,710
"No epitaph for those
who don't keep their promises.

28
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,050
"To Jeanne and Simon,

29
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,800
"childhood is a knife stuck in your throat.

30
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,640
"It can't be easily removed.

31
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,970
"Jeanne,

32
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,430
"Mr. Lebel will give you an envelope.

33
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,940
"The envelope is for your father.

34
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,610
"Find him

35
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,190
"and give it to him.

36
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,990
"Simon, the notary will
give you an envelope..."

37
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,700
I've heard enough.

38
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
I haven't finished.

39
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,170
Go on.

40
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,970
"Simon, the notary will
give you an envelope.

41
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,680
"The envelope is for your brother.

42
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
"Find him

43
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,890
"and give him the envelope.

44
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,890
To the son

45
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,770
"When the envelopes have been delivered,

46
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,730
"you will be given a letter,

47
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,030
"the silence will be broken,

48
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,530
"a promise kept,

49
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,660
"and you can place a stone on my grave,

50
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,450
"and on it engrave my name in the sun."

51
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,220
I admit, it's unusual.

52
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,730
Anything to sign?

53
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,520
No, not today.

54
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay.

55
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,900
Thanks, Jean.

56
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,650
- Let's go.
- Wait.

57
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,120
You know about our father.

58
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,700
That we have no brother.

59
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,660
Why'd you let her write that?

60
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,130
I understand your reaction.

61
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,920
It's very surprising.

62
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,630
Don't pretend you buy this.
You knew her. It can't be.

63
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,760
One doesn't invent such things,

64
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,300
not in a will.

65
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,140
There's this, too.

66
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,990
Look, your mother
has left us something rather...

67
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,540
We'll sleep on it and...

68
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,790
We'll be in touch.

69
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll wait outside. Thank you, Jean.

70
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,880
Sit down, Simon.

71
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,210
Look, Jean...

72
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,130
Your secretary liked working for you.

73
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,590
At least she did that right. Bravo.

74
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,970
But your secretary was my mother.

75
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,560
And that job, a whole other matter...

76
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Simon...

77
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,230
Bury your secretary how you want.

78
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
But I'll bury my mom normally.

79
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,820
For once in her life
she'll have acted normally.

80
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,740
End of discussion.

81
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,090
Take your time.

82
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,920
Come back when Simon's calmer.

83
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,810
I know it's very unusual,

84
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,940
but your mother wasn't crazy, Jeanne.

85
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,380
We're a big family suddenly.

86
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,380
She ever mention a dog?

87
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,130
Big families always have a dog.

88
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,800
Do we have to find it now, too?

89
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,140
She's fucking crazy.

90
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,690
I'll talk to Jean.

91
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,650
About what?

92
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,150
Having a normal funeral.

93
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,320
We'll take care of her, then you.

94
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,710
Where you going?

95
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,260
Bury her any way you want.

96
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,970
Cut it out.

97
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,350
You weren't there when she died...

98
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,730
You were there when she had her accident...

99
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,850
You feel guilty about everything!

100
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,980
I don't feel guilty.

101
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,110
Do you realize what we just heard?

102
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,070
She's gone, Christ! It's over.
Peace at last!

103
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
I feel so fucking peaceful!

104
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,420
I'm at peace.

105
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,010
I can see that.

106
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
The mathematics you've studied until now

107
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,480
have sought to provide
clear and definitive answers

108
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,310
to clear and definitive problems.

109
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,020
Now you are embarking on a new adventure.

110
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,480
You will face insoluble problems

111
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,280
that will lead to other,
equally insoluble problems.

112
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,990
Friends will insist that
the object of your toil

113
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,990
is futile.

114
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,410
You'll have no way of defending yourself

115
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,250
for the problems will be
of mind-boggling complexity.

116
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,170
Welcome to pure mathematics

117
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,510
and the realm of solitude.

118
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,680
Let me introduce my assistant,

119
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,510
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

120
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Hello.

121
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,100
We'll start with the Collatz conjecture.

122
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,610
What does your intuition tell you?

123
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,660
Your intuition is always right.

124
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,330
That's why you have the makings
of a true mathematician.

125
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,340
But for this you're going to need help.

126
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,960
Do you have family there?

127
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,220
Any contacts?

128
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,720
It's ridiculous, Niv.

129
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,180
You just learned that A;
Your father is alive,

130
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,390
and B; You have another brother.

131
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,480
What's ridiculous is
to challenge the inevitable.

132
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,900
You have to know,

133
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,320
or your mind will never be at peace.

134
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,320
And without peace of mind,
no pure mathematics.

135
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,000
You need a starting point.

136
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,590
My father died during the war, in Daresh.

137
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,960
That's the unknown variable.

138
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,470
You never start with the unknown variable.

139
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,010
My mom's from Der Om,
a village in the Fouad.

140
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,440
She studied French at Daresh University.

141
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,150
If she studied, there's hope.

142
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,940
Saïd Haidar.

143
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,740
You'll pay a visit to Saïd Haidar.

144
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,160
An old friend who teaches in Daresh.

145
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,030
You can trust him.

146
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,290
Mom?

147
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,200
Are you all right?

148
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,710
What are you doing?

149
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
Mom?

150
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,340
Are you okay?

151
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,720
Madame, you're on my towel.

152
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
Mom?

153
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,260
What happened?

154
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,550
Where's Jeanne?

155
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,470
Mom?

156
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,030
Does she get migraines?

157
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,280
No.

158
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,990
Memory lapses?

159
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,030
No.

160
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,780
Incidences of falling?

161
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,910
No.

162
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,950
Moments of confusion?

163
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,410
She's usually confused.

164
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,750
No, she's never confused.

165
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,780
Wahab, come.

166
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,220
Let go of my sister.

167
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,690
Where are you going, son of a refugee?

168
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,440
Nicolas, stop!

169
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,280
Go back home!

170
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
Wahab!

171
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,780
We'll seek you in your camps
and slaughter you!

172
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,910
Give it!

173
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,250
- I want to.
- It's my duty.

174
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,750
You stained our family's honor.

175
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,250
That's enough!

176
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,090
Come home now!

177
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,590
Come home!

178
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,930
Get away!

179
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,030
What have you done?

180
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,610
You've humiliated us,
ruined the family name!

181
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,240
Why, my God,
have you cast us into darkness?

182
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,660
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do this to me?

183
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,290
What am I to do with you?
Should I kill you?

184
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,500
I'm pregnant, Grandma.

185
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,880
My God, blackness everywhere! Why?

186
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,050
Why did you do this to us?

187
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,560
Am I supposed to kill you?

188
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
What am I going to do with you?

189
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,850
Eat.

190
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,770
Eat if you want your child to be strong.

191
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,860
Listen to me carefully.

192
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
There's nothing here for you now.

193
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,080
I'll help you after the birth.

194
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,370
I want you to leave here.

195
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,880
You'll stay with your
Uncle Charbel in town.

196
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,170
You'll go to school there.

197
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,670
You'll learn to read, to think.

198
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
To escape this misery.

199
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,640
Promise me and I'll help you.

200
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,890
Promise me that you'll go to school.

201
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,110
I promise you, Grandma.

202
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,030
I promise you.

203
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,610
Take a good look at your mother.
So you'll recognize her.

204
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,660
I'll find you again one day.
I promise you, my love.

205
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,140
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

206
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,510
Come, it's time you left.

207
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,090
I see terrible times ahead.

208
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,200
One day I'll find you, my son.

209
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,260
I received the message
from my friend Niv Cohen,

210
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,970
but I can't help you.

211
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,380
Because, back then,

212
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,850
I was teaching
the history of mathematics at Paris Xl.

213
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,560
More precisely, the period when

214
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,400
Leonhard Euler succeeded,

215
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,730
although blind,

216
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,570
in first providing
a formal mathematical resolution

217
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,070
to the problem of
the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.

218
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
Yes.

219
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,330
He defied Diderot at the Court,

220
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,580
by declaring,

221
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
"Sir,

222
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:59,040
"e\pi * pi\p + 1 = 0.

223
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
"Therefore, God exists!"

224
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Niv, Niv, Niv...

225
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,440
Hello. Do you speak French?

226
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,440
Of course. Can I help you?

227
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,490
I'm looking for someone
who might know this woman.

228
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,200
She studied here about 35 years ago.

229
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,370
You're kidding, right? I wasn't born.

230
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,540
I can't help...

231
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,040
I'm not kidding.
You must know someone who can help.

232
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,130
I've traveled too far. Please.

233
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,220
Her name is Nawal Marwan.

234
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,480
You're kind.

235
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,980
No, I want to get rid of you.

236
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,730
Najat, it's me.

237
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,230
Got any time to waste?

238
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,360
She looks familiar.

239
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,280
Perhaps she worked
on the student newspaper.

240
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,500
That was long ago.

241
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,420
The people who left changed their identity.

242
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,210
But it's striking.

243
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,600
The photograph of your mother
was taken in Kfar Ryat.

244
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,770
Look here.

245
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,490
It's the sign for Kfar Ryat.

246
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,320
It's a prison in the South.

247
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,160
You don't know of Kfar Ryat?

248
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,500
No.

249
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,630
Then you're definitely not from here.

250
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,630
You don't know the South.

251
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,540
If the international community

252
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,630
does not intervene immediately,

253
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,590
the refugees,

254
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,840
crammed into camps along the border...

255
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,470
She's here.

256
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,770
We students oppose the Nationalist Party

257
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,610
and expelling the refugees in the South.

258
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,530
The Nationalists support
the Christian right,

259
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,780
who openly threaten the refugees.

260
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,570
The refugees are armed

261
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,080
and have the support of most
of the Muslims in this country.

262
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,710
But you yourself are Christian.

263
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,710
We stand for peace.
This is not about religion.

264
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,890
Nawal!

265
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,140
The radio! They shut the university!

266
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,890
The Nationalists closed down the campus!

267
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,080
Nawal, come back!

268
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,580
Stay here!

269
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,040
Uncle Charbel, they shut the campus!

270
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,130
There will be fighting.

271
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,550
I want you to stay with me.

272
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,280
There's gunfire.

273
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,200
Girls, come eat!

274
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,200
Mom, they attacked the university!

275
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,790
That's no reason not to eat.

276
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,910
Christian villages in the
South were attacked.

277
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,170
God help us!

278
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,630
That's why they shut the university.

279
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,010
It won't be long before
it blows up here, too.

280
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,180
We'll go to the mountains
until things calm down.

281
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,100
For how long?

282
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,810
We go tomorrow.

283
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,940
The rest of the family is already there.

284
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,100
What about school?

285
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,690
The schools will close anyway.

286
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,190
God only knows until when.

287
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,860
And the newspaper?

288
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,530
Don't worry.

289
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,080
The paper can survive
without us for a while.

290
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,960
Ideas only survive
if we're there to defend them!

291
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,870
Exactly, Rafqa.

292
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,210
Exactly.

293
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,770
There are two orphanages there.

294
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,390
I'll come later on foot.

295
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,850
You're not going there now!

296
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,070
- You promised Grandma...
- You heard your dad.

297
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,990
If they attack the camps,
the country's lost.

298
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,780
School's finished.

299
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,080
I think of him every day.

300
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,250
He's my child.

301
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
I want to find him.

302
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,360
I'm going to Shadia's for water.

303
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,780
Make it quick, Nawal.

304
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,230
- Name?
- Nawal.

305
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,650
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

306
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,860
Where are you going?

307
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,200
The South.

308
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,490
Why?

309
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,660
To join my husband.

310
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,010
Wahab.

311
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,250
It's always been a girls' orphanage?

312
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,420
The boys moved
to Kfar Khout three years ago.

313
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,010
Come with us.
Kfar Khout was attacked yesterday.

314
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,720
I'm looking for the orphanage.
Do you know where it is?

315
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,310
There.

316
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,230
The children! Where are the children?

317
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,520
Ask someone who was there.

318
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:22,110
The Muslim villagers have fled
to the camp in Deressa.

319
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,320
They fear the reprisals that'll come.

320
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,040
Maybe the children are with them.

321
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:36,090
Chamseddine and his men killed
all the Christians to avenge the refugees.

322
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,680
Maybe the children are in Deressa.

323
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,970
Are you going to Deressa?

324
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,460
I'm Christian.

325
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,100
My daughter! My daughter!

326
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:52,370
THE SOUTH

327
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,280
Hi, Simon. It's me.

328
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,240
I'm in Mom's village. I wish you were here.

329
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Listen.

330
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,680
I told you never to come back here!

331
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,430
Hello.

332
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,560
Souha?

333
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,400
Ahmed loves you! Ahmed loves you!

334
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:32,570
I told you to stop saying that!

335
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,290
Hello.

336
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,830
Can I help you?

337
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,040
Hello.

338
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,220
Does anyone speak French or English?

339
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,630
Where's Samia?

340
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,430
Thank you.

341
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,490
You speak French?

342
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,570
Yes. Hello.

343
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,740
Hello.

344
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,450
My name is Samia.

345
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,700
I'm Jeanne Marwan.

346
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,750
Thanks for helping.

347
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:04,920
Marwan? There are lots of Marwans here.

348
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,420
Really?

349
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,500
I'm from Canada.

350
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,090
I'm looking for Souha.

351
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,890
Souha? That's her.

352
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,140
She's my great-grandmother.

353
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,650
The grocer at the corner gave me your name.

354
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,660
I'm looking for my father.
His name is Wahab.

355
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,300
My mother was Nawal Marwan.

356
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,840
She was born here.

357
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:01,770
We don't know her.

358
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,180
Yes, we know her.

359
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,440
Her mother is a disgrace!

360
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:32,090
The Marwan family was struck by disgrace.

361
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,340
The war came.

362
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,720
I'm looking for Wahab.

363
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,640
She doesn't know Wahab.

364
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,740
I can't help you. I'm sorry, I'm tired.

365
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,790
If you are the daughter of Nawal Marwan,

366
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,800
you are not welcome here.

367
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,670
Go home.

368
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,850
You're looking for your father,

369
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,560
but you don't know who your mother is.

370
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,590
I arrived after
the massacre at the Deressa camp.

371
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,130
Everything was smoldering.

372
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,600
I searched for my son among pools of blood.

373
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:15,020
I never want to forget
what I saw and heard.

374
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,100
You say you oppose our enemy.

375
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,440
That does not make you our friend.

376
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,070
Why should Chamseddine trust you?

377
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,910
My son's father was a Deressa refugee.

378
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,240
My son was swallowed by the war.

379
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,460
I have nothing left to lose.

380
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,250
I have only hatred for the Nationalists.

381
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,010
That's not what
you wrote in Charbel's newspaper.

382
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,260
My uncle believed that his words
and books would promote peace.

383
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,470
I believed him.

384
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,060
Life taught me otherwise.

385
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,320
What do you want now?

386
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:08,910
To teach the enemy what life has taught me.

387
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,210
Very good.

388
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,380
Very good. You just forgot this.

389
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,720
How's the French?

390
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,850
I am much gooder, Dad.

391
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:22,400
The comparative
of "good" is "better," darling.

392
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:28,940
I want my son to speak several languages.

393
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:31,950
So he can understand
without an intermediary.

394
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,180
Nawal here.

395
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,770
How are you, Nawal? This is Nouchine.

396
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,150
Good evening, Nouchine.
How is your mother?

397
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,940
My mother is very well. Tomorrow at 10 a.m.

398
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,570
Tomorrow it is.

399
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,940
Hey, lovely.

400
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,190
Good morning.

401
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,320
Will you go out with us Thursday?

402
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
No.

403
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,410
- Friday?
- No.

404
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,330
- Saturday?
- No.

405
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,500
We're patient!

406
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,210
So am I.

407
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:03,010
Don't forget. "Always" always takes an "s."

408
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,450
Goddamn whore!

409
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:53,520
Amnesty International repeatedly
condemned the Kfar Ryat prison.

410
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,570
This is the women's section.

411
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,160
The cells are bigger.

412
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,740
Some prisoners were kept for 15 years.

413
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,550
When was it built?

414
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,090
After the massacres.

415
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,510
Right after war started.

416
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:29,100
They jailed 600 political prisoners.

417
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:34,430
You can go in. I'll take a picture.

418
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,450
Do you know her?

419
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,490
It was taken here.

420
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,830
I don't know her.
That was a long time ago, so me...

421
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,290
Do you know anyone who worked here?

422
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,430
Hello.

423
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,430
I'm looking for Fahim Harrsa.

424
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,770
I'm the school janitor.

425
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,480
Yes, but before?

426
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,570
Before?

427
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,450
That was before I was school janitor.

428
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,370
I've been the school janitor a long time.

429
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,330
Do you know this woman?

430
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,540
She was in Kfar Ryat.

431
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,710
I'm the school janitor. End of story.

432
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:31,470
I need someone who knew her

433
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,930
who can tell me about her.

434
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,020
She's my mother.

435
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,520
She's the Woman who Sings.

436
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,400
Number 72.

437
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,360
She shot the leader
of the right-wing Christian militias.

438
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,990
They made her pay a high price.

439
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,240
Very high.

440
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,620
Fifteen years.

441
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,500
"The Woman who Sings."

442
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,460
She sang all the time.

443
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,260
You're sure it's her?

444
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,430
I spent 13 years watching her.

445
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,810
Have you ever spent
13 years watching someone?

446
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,480
They did everything to break her.

447
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,860
At the end she still stood tall

448
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,240
and looked them in the eye.

449
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,370
Never seen anyone like her.

450
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,450
She wouldn't break.

451
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,790
They were enraged.

452
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,510
So they sent Abou Tarek.

453
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,010
Who's that?

454
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:05,440
Abou Tarek.

455
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,730
You know, sometimes,

456
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,400
it's better not to know.

457
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,660
I live with it anyway.

458
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,530
Go on.

459
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,040
Abou Tarek...

460
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,080
Abou Tarek was a torture specialist.

461
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,330
He raped her again and again.

462
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,750
To break her before her release.

463
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,010
So she'd stop singing.

464
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,050
In the end,

465
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:41,510
she became pregnant.

466
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,890
It was like that. I'll never forget.

467
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,520
72. Made pregnant by Abou Tarek.

468
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,780
They waited until

469
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,610
she gave birth in prison.

470
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,910
Then they let her go.

471
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,660
The baby?

472
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,370
Did you see the baby?

473
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,630
There was a doctor who sometimes came.

474
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,550
I believe he went crazy.

475
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:18,130
Others say he has a restaurant in Tel Aviv.

476
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:24,720
That's bullshit. He went
crazy or else he died.

477
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,850
Now, the nurse... I know her.

478
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,400
She lives in Daresh.

479
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:34,940
In Daresh.

480
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:47,750
Listen, Simon. I don't give a shit.
Just shut up!

481
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,500
Mom was in prison.

482
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,540
Simon, Mom...

483
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,090
Mom was raped.

484
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,920
She had our brother in jail.

485
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,140
I need you.

486
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:23,740
THE WOMAN WHO SINGS

487
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,860
The contracts of Notary Amyott.

488
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,610
From 1868-1892.

489
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,990
His son, Edouard, took over until 1925.

490
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,410
All handwritten.

491
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,950
My grandfather, Charles.

492
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,740
My father, Henri.

493
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:15,290
And me.

494
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,790
The end, because I'm the
last of the Lebels.

495
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:23,000
I'll show you the will of a man

496
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:27,170
who led parallel lives.

497
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,100
Turned out he had three wives.

498
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,310
Here,

499
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:37,810
in Miami and in Honduras,
where he did business.

500
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:39,810
So now,

501
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,150
it's not three children involved,

502
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,650
but eight.

503
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,360
That was fun, believe you me!

504
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:49,070
Look.

505
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,410
Death is never the end of the story.

506
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:56,790
It always leaves tracks.

507
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,330
To find your brother,
you have to retrace your mom's past.

508
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:06,460
Jean, I want to find my sister. That's all.

509
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,010
I'm on it.

510
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,880
I have a few quick things to wrap up.

511
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:13,850
Pack your stuff. We'll leave in...

512
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,850
My passport!

513
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:17,390
We?

514
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,310
Haven't you done enough?

515
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,440
Exactly. I can't pull out now.

516
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,360
Grow up, Simon.

517
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,360
I know you need me.

518
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,780
We find her and come back.

519
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:34,870
Promise.

520
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:38,000
For a notary, Mr. Marwan, a promise

521
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,040
is sacred.

522
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,550
Now sing.

523
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:47,620
That's it. That's it.

524
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:51,160
The baby's coming.

525
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:52,790
I can see its head.

526
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,290
Push.

527
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:57,670
Go on, dear.

528
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,430
The first one is out.

529
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:30,620
Rest a bit now.

530
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,170
I'm proud of you.

531
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:37,000
Get ready for the second.

532
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:07,870
Stop.

533
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,370
Give.

534
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:14,210
- What are you doing?
- You threw them in the river like always.

535
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,170
- It's dangerous.
- No.

536
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,250
You did your duty.
You threw them in the river.

537
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,880
I'll look after them.

538
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,630
They're the babies of the Woman who Sings.

539
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:49,450
We are a battlefield for other countries.

540
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:53,250
Imagine if there'd been notaries
back in Noah's day.

541
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,580
We'd only have to look up
the property deeds.

542
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:59,420
This is your land. This is your land.

543
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:01,550
The right of way...

544
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:03,710
Done. Everyone's happy.

545
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:06,840
Notaries only began 1,000 years ago.

546
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,430
That's the problem.

547
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,300
We should've been there day one.

548
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,180
Thank you again for your help.

549
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:16,440
It's my pleasure, dear colleague.

550
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,020
I have the information
you requested by e-mail.

551
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:23,190
Simon, my briefcase is right beside you.

552
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,320
Would you please hand it to Mr. Lebel?

553
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,660
You're very kind, but with the jet lag,

554
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,490
we'll look at it later.

555
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,330
In brief, for the father it's complicated.

556
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:36,460
There's no death certificate.

557
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,460
- For the brother...
- Excuse me, what's this about?

558
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,050
I asked for help, Simon.

559
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:45,670
Mr. Maddad agreed, to speed things up.

560
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,340
I told you, we're here to find Jeanne.

561
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,720
Your sister's
the easiest family member to find.

562
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,730
I'm so happy you're here.

563
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:05,690
Me, too.

564
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:16,700
The nurse who helped Mom deliver in jail...

565
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,000
We can go see her today.

566
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,380
Jeanne, it's enough.

567
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,840
Just shut up and come with me.

568
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:30,180
It's your job to find our brother.

569
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,930
If not for her or yourself, do it for me.

570
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,440
She's in hospital.

571
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:49,280
I'm glad you're here.

572
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,530
Me, too, dear. Me, too.

573
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,780
If she's sleeping, you'll come back.

574
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:20,810
Mrs. Maïka?

575
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,430
Hello, madame.

576
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,430
Thanks for seeing us.

577
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,760
It's about someone you knew.

578
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,270
You know Nawal Marwan?

579
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,920
You were a nurse at Kfar Ryat?

580
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:49,060
She says she knew your mother.

581
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:52,480
You helped our mother give birth?

582
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:08,880
Madame, we're looking
for the child she had in jail.

583
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,380
Can you help us?

584
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:17,510
She worked in Kfar Ryat prison.

585
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,600
She assisted her during delivery.

586
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,600
She safeguarded the babies.

587
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:35,360
And returned them
to the Woman who Sings upon her release.

588
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:39,200
- Sarwan! Janaan!
- Nawal Marwan had twins.

589
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,960
You really knew the Woman who Sings?

590
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,960
You don't know what it means for me.

591
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:04,210
Nawal Marwan worked 18 years for me.

592
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,800
As my secretary.

593
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:09,090
My wife and I were fond
of her and her children.

594
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:13,640
But I realize I didn't
really know her after all.

595
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:18,640
- Ready?
- Ready.

596
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:36,830
At my request, Mr. Maddad did research

597
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:39,290
to find your brother and father.

598
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:49,170
For the father, Abou Tarek,
there's no death certificate.

599
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:51,880
Many in this country disappeared.

600
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,680
He may have gone abroad.
That's what his kind often did.

601
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:59,980
They're either dead or they left.

602
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,520
Wait and see.

603
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,900
Maybe this is best.

604
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,860
For the brother...

605
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:09,530
Your client, Mrs. Nawal Marwan

606
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:11,320
is from the village of Der Om.

607
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,870
She gave the child to
a midwife named Elham,

608
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:19,160
who placed him at the Kfar Khout orphanage

609
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,120
in May 1970.

610
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:26,040
It was hard to locate the registries.

611
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:29,590
Many documents were destroyed in the war.

612
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,970
But I finally turned up the registries.

613
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:36,640
The Sisters of Charity
collected and donated them

614
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,310
to the National Archives.

615
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,810
In May 1970,

616
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:44,310
the midwife of Der Om, Elham,

617
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,190
gave up a male child for adoption.

618
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,320
The only boy placed
at the orphanage that month.

619
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:55,320
Look, he was registered
under the first name of Nihad.

620
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,240
The dates match.

621
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,750
It's him.

622
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:04,920
He's your brother. Nihad.

623
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:11,050
Kfar Khout orphanage.

624
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:15,090
Nihad of May.
That was his name for the records.

625
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,970
Nihad of the month of May.

626
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,180
The month of arrival
was a temporary surname.

627
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:25,140
There were no adoptions at the time.
The war had started.

628
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:28,110
In 1974 the orphanage was destroyed.

629
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,610
We must ask who destroyed Kfar Khout

630
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,780
to learn what happened to the children.

631
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:41,240
Between you and me,
given what occurred in the region,

632
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:43,540
there's little hope.

633
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,040
He's probably dead, too.

634
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:51,130
I didn't say dead. I
said we lost his trace.

635
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,720
They're both dead.

636
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,510
We open the letters. Finished.

637
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:01,220
I won't allow it. This
kind of thing is sacred.

638
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,310
It would be like a rape.

639
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:07,310
Great, it runs in the family.

640
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,730
Sorry.

641
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:16,030
There's one path left,

642
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,320
but it's somewhat radical.

643
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,160
The warlord who razed
the orphanage is still alive.

644
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,040
He may know what happened
to Nihad and the others.

645
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:29,750
It's been an eternity.

646
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,210
You must understand,
those years saw a series of reprisals

647
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,840
that set off each other
with merciless logic.

648
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:40,850
Like an equation.

649
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:47,270
A warlord is precisely the kind of man
with a long memory.

650
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,730
He'll remember, believe me.

651
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:54,280
Wallat Chamseddine. That's his name.

652
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,030
Where do we find him?

653
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,030
You don't find him, he finds you.

654
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:08,210
We can try something.

655
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:12,710
Do you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

656
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,880
It's your turn.

657
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,350
You'll travel to the Deressa refugee camp.

658
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,640
You'll drink tea.

659
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:31,310
With whomever invites you.

660
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,020
You'll tell them you're the son
of the Woman who Sings.

661
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:36,070
You're looking for Nihad of May.

662
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,440
You can't go alone.

663
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,240
I'll find someone to accompany you.

664
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,270
Welcome to Deressa.

665
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,920
Know where we're going?

666
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,210
No idea.

667
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:47,160
How are you?

668
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:50,200
Look, you're a grown man!

669
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:53,160
I finished my engineering degree.

670
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:57,880
I can't find work, so I drive a taxi.

671
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,250
What brings you here?

672
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:05,970
I'm with some foreign visitors
who asked me to bring them here.

673
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,140
Welcome. Come.

674
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:11,390
No, thank you. We're short of time.

675
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:13,270
Please, come.

676
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,070
He's inviting us for tea.

677
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:22,400
Okay.

678
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,500
He asked me why you came to Deressa.

679
01:44:46,930 --> 01:44:49,220
To find someone, Nihad of May.

680
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,060
He doesn't know a Nihad of May.

681
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:04,480
He asks what your name is.

682
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:15,330
My mother's from Der Om in the South.

683
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:30,300
My mother's the Woman who Sings.

684
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:57,290
Yeah, it's done.

685
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,380
Wait for what?

686
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,290
Sarwan Marwan?

687
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:40,370
Yes.

688
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,370
We've come to offer our help.

689
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,580
You'll be back in an hour.

690
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,300
- Can I tell my sister?
- No, only an hour.

691
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,550
That's a promise.

692
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:54,180
I'll put on a shirt. One sec.

693
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:58,810
He's calling.

694
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,640
That's okay.

695
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:04,350
Already? Don't worry, you can go with them.

696
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,480
In the South, one spark
sets everything off.

697
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:08,730
All right.

698
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,690
You helped us. Now it's
our turn to help you.

699
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,560
You'll leave the country.

700
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,610
It will be simpler.

701
01:48:31,690 --> 01:48:34,320
We'll find you a home and a job.

702
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,240
I want you to have a better life.

703
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:42,660
We have many contacts in America.

704
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,660
You must go with your children.

705
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:50,170
I know they're alive. Take them with you.

706
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:57,340
Your children will help you, you'll see.

707
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:06,180
You can't ask that of me.

708
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,850
Your children are our children.

709
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:13,270
Your family is our family.

710
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,820
Trust me.

711
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:19,490
I will help you.

712
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:22,700
I will always be there for you
and your children.

713
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,580
Hello, Sarwan.

714
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:19,550
Forgive the precautions,
but it's for your protection.

715
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:24,260
I am called Wallat Chamseddine.

716
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:28,430
Tell me,

717
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,930
how can I help you, Sarwan Marwan?

718
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,440
You knew my mother?

719
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,400
Let's say she worked for me.

720
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,650
How can I help you?

721
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:47,660
I'm looking for a man named Nihad of May.

722
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:51,040
Why do you want Nihad of May?

723
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:56,790
He's my brother.
My mother asked me to find him.

724
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:03,010
How can you say that Nihad of May
is the son of Nawal Marwan?

725
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:09,850
My brother was placed
at the Kfar Khout orphanage.

726
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,810
We found the birth records.

727
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,980
The dates, everything fits.

728
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:19,650
Nihad of May is my brother.

729
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:06,700
My friends and I attacked
the Christians of Kfar Khout

730
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:11,990
to avenge the aggressions
against our brother refugees.

731
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,000
There was an orphanage in Kfar Khout.

732
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:19,960
I spared the children

733
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,960
and I took them with us.

734
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:24,920
Nihad was among them.

735
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:29,890
We trained them,
prepared them to fight alongside us.

736
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:33,810
Nihad had a gift.

737
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:35,730
He was special.

738
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:39,730
He quickly became a formidable marksman.

739
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,190
But

740
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:45,030
he wanted to find his mother.

741
01:52:45,570 --> 01:52:47,400
He searched for months.

742
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,910
I don't know what he saw or heard.

743
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,750
He became

744
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:58,000
crazed with war.

745
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,080
He came back to see me.

746
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:02,090
He wanted to be a martyr.

747
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:06,970
His mother would see his photo
on every wall in the country.

748
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:09,930
But I refused.

749
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:12,800
He went back to Daresh.

750
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:17,940
He became
the most dangerous sniper in the region.

751
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,060
A real machine.

752
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:21,940
He would shoot at anyone.

753
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:26,780
And then there was the enemy invasion.

754
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:30,030
And one morning,

755
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,530
they captured Nihad.

756
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:34,620
He'd killed seven soldiers.

757
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,080
They didn't kill him.

758
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:42,960
They trained him
and sent him to the Kfar Ryat prison.

759
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,750
He was in prison?

760
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:46,960
Yes.

761
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,130
As a torturer.

762
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:54,680
With my father?

763
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,760
No.

764
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:59,060
He didn't work with Abou
Tarek, your father.

765
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:29,670
You okay?

766
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:36,010
One plus one

767
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:38,520
makes two.

768
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,430
What?

769
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:45,690
One plus one makes two.

770
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:48,360
It can't make one.

771
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,530
You're feverish.

772
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,450
Jeanne?

773
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:05,040
One plus one... Can it make one?

774
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,440
There's a chair.

775
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:29,940
Take it if you want.

776
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,740
Can I help you, madame?

777
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,670
I'm sorry.

778
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:23,820
When he became a torturer,

779
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:25,740
your brother changed names.

780
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,120
He became

781
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:29,870
Abou Tarek.

782
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,630
Nihad of May is Abou Tarek.

783
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:43,590
We know he's living in Canada
under a new identity.

784
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,470
Nihad Harmanni.

785
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,970
Mr. Harmanni?

786
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:30,970
Yes.

787
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:39,820
This is for you.

788
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:12,520
Letter to the father

789
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:27,860
I'm shaking as I write.

790
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,950
I recognized you.

791
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:32,620
You didn't recognize me.

792
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:34,750
It's magnificent, a miracle.

793
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:37,170
I am your number 72.

794
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:40,670
Our children will deliver this.

795
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,170
You won't recognize them

796
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:45,880
for they are beautiful.

797
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,880
But they know who you are.

798
02:00:56,810 --> 02:01:00,610
Through them, I want to tell you
that you are still alive.

799
02:01:01,610 --> 02:01:04,610
Soon you'll turn silent... I know.

800
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:08,860
For all are silent before the truth.

801
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:10,990
Signed...

802
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:12,780
Whore 72.

803
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,680
I speak to the son,

804
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:31,090
not to the torturer.

805
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:34,930
Whatever happens, I'll always love you.

806
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,890
I promised you that when you were born,
my son.

807
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:41,350
Whatever happens,

808
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,110
I'll always love you.

809
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:45,940
I looked for you all my life.

810
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,110
I found you.

811
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,320
You couldn't recognize me.

812
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:55,120
You've a tattoo on your right heel.

813
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:57,410
I saw it.

814
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,210
I recognized you.

815
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,710
You are beautiful.

816
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,300
I wrap you in tenderness, my love.

817
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:07,800
Take solace,

818
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,970
for nothing means more than being together.

819
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,890
You were born of love.

820
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:17,850
So your brother and sister
were born of love, too.

821
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:21,900
Nothing means more than being together.

822
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,480
Your mother,

823
02:02:24,730 --> 02:02:26,780
Nawal Marwan,

824
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:29,150
Prisoner No. 72.

825
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:40,580
"When the envelopes have been delivered,

826
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:42,420
"you will be given a letter,

827
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:44,250
"the silence will be broken,

828
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,090
"a promise kept,

829
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:48,920
"and you can place a stone on my grave,

830
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:51,720
"and on it engrave my name in the sun."

831
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,950
My loves,

832
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:17,200
where does your story begin?

833
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:20,160
At your birth?

834
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:23,410
If so, it begins in horror.

835
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,960
At the birth of your father?

836
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:30,760
Then it begins in a great love story.

837
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:36,390
But I say your story begins with a promise

838
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:38,970
to break the chain of anger.

839
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:43,980
Thanks to you, today I
have finally kept it.

840
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:45,850
The chain is broken.

841
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:50,320
Finally I can take the time to cradle you,

842
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,570
to gently sing a lullaby to console you.

843
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:58,280
Nothing means more than being together.

844
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:01,240
I love you.

845
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:04,160
Your mother.

846
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:06,500
Nawal.
