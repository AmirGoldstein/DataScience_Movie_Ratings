00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,620
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,</font></b>

2
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.</font></b>

3
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you aware of my existence?</font></b>

4
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

5
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,720
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is good.</font></b>

6
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?</font></b>

7
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

8
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please tell me what you've heard.</font></b>

9
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard</font></b>

10
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,570
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">that the Fuhrer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France</font></b>

11
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,570
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.</font></b>

12
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fuhrer couldn't have
said it better himself.</font></b>

13
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,500
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But the meaning of your visit,</font></b>

14
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.</font></b>

15
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,090
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews</font></b>

16
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and found nothing.</font></b>

17
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm aware of that.</font></b>

18
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've read the reports of this area.</font></b>

19
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But like any enterprise,
when under new management,</font></b>

20
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,</font></b>

21
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,570
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.</font></b>

22
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,620
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I just have a few
questions, monsieur LaPadite.</font></b>

23
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can assist me with answers,</font></b>

24
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">my department can close
the file on your family.</font></b>

25
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now,</font></b>

26
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,</font></b>

27
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,060
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">all dairy farmers like yourself.</font></b>

28
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts</font></b>

29
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Dreyfuses.</font></b>

30
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that correct?</font></b>

31
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">To my knowledge,</font></b>

32
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.</font></b>

33
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,330
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Herr Colonel, would it
disturb you if I smoked my pipe?</font></b>

34
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, monsieur LaPadite,</font></b>

35
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,960
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">this is your house, make
yourself comfortable.</font></b>

36
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, according to these papers,</font></b>

37
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for</font></b>

38
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">except the Dreyfuses.</font></b>

39
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.</font></b>

40
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape</font></b>

41
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">or someone is very
successfully hiding them.</font></b>

42
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?</font></b>

43
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only rumors.</font></b>

44
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,030
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I love rumors!</font></b>

45
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Facts could be so misleading,</font></b>

46
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.</font></b>

47
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, monsieur LaPadite,</font></b>

48
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?</font></b>

49
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, this is just a rumor,</font></b>

50
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.</font></b>

51
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the rumors you've
heard have been of escape?</font></b>

52
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

53
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me</font></b>

54
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the exact members of the
household and their names?</font></b>

55
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There were five of them.</font></b>

56
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The father, Jacob.</font></b>

57
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wife, Miram.</font></b>

58
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And her brother, Bob.</font></b>

59
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,940
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How old is Bob?</font></b>

60
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,900
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thirty, 31.</font></b>

61
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Continue.</font></b>

62
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the children,</font></b>

63
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Amos</font></b>

64
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,790
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and Shosanna.</font></b>

65
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,800
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ages of the children?</font></b>

66
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Amos was nine or 10.</font></b>

67
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And Shosanna?</font></b>

68
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,810
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And Shosanna was</font></b>

69
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">18 or 19. I'm not really sure.</font></b>

70
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess that should do it.</font></b>

71
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?</font></b>

72
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,800
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But of course.</font></b>

73
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monsieur LaPadite,</font></b>

74
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?</font></b>

75
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,740
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no interest in such things.</font></b>

76
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But you are aware of what they call me.</font></b>

77
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm aware.</font></b>

78
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you aware of?</font></b>

79
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That they call you "The Jew Hunter."</font></b>

80
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,060
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Precisely.</font></b>

81
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,020
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.</font></b>

82
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,400
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Heydrich apparently hates the moniker</font></b>

83
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.</font></b>

84
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.</font></b>

85
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">lt would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.</font></b>

86
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,240
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title</font></b>

87
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">precisely because I've earned it.</font></b>

88
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,210
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,</font></b>

89
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">as opposed to most German soldiers,</font></b>

90
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,090
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can think like a Jew</font></b>

91
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">where they can only think like a German.</font></b>

92
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">More
precisely, a German soldier.</font></b>

93
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,900
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,</font></b>

94
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,990
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.</font></b>

95
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,</font></b>

96
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it would be that of the rat.</font></b>

97
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fuhrer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.</font></b>

98
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,210
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But where our conclusions differ,</font></b>

99
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">is I don't consider the
comparison an insult.</font></b>

100
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.</font></b>

101
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a hostile world, indeed.</font></b>

102
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,</font></b>

103
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">would you greet it with hostility?</font></b>

104
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose I would.</font></b>

105
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,940
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Has a rat ever done anything to you</font></b>

106
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to create this animosity
you feel toward them?</font></b>

107
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rats spread disease. They bite people.</font></b>

108
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.</font></b>

109
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I propose to you any
disease a rat could spread,</font></b>

110
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">a squirrel could equally carry.</font></b>

111
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you agree?</font></b>

112
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels</font></b>

113
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">that you do with rats, do you?</font></b>

114
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font></b>

115
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?</font></b>

116
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?</font></b>

117
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.</font></b>

118
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,440
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However interesting
as the thought may be,</font></b>

119
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.</font></b>

120
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking</font></b>

121
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?</font></b>

122
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably not.</font></b>

123
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think so.</font></b>

124
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't like them.</font></b>

125
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,210
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't really know
why you don't like them.</font></b>

126
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All you know is you find them repulsive.</font></b>

127
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search</font></b>

128
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,930
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">of a house suspected of hiding Jews.</font></b>

129
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does the hawk look?</font></b>

130
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,</font></b>

131
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,230
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">he looks everywhere he would hide.</font></b>

132
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.</font></b>

133
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, the reason the Fuhrer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria</font></b>

134
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,790
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.</font></b>

135
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of</font></b>

136
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,500
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">once they abandon dignity.</font></b>

137
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">May I smoke my pipe as well?</font></b>

138
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.</font></b>

139
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, my job dictates</font></b>

140
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,450

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">cross 5,000 miles of water,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and jump out of a fucking airplane to

180
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nazi ain't got no humanity.</font></b>

181
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and they need to be destroyed.</font></b>

183
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why any and every son of a

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">they're going to die.</font></b>

185
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.</font></b>

186
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That means I got a little lndian in me.</font></b>

187
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,530
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.</font></b>

188
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We will be cruel to the Germans.</font></b>

189
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,620
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.</font></b>

190
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And they will find the
evidence of our cruelty</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">in the disemboweled, dismembered</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.</font></b>

193
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the German won't be
able to help themselves</font></b>

194
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands,</font></b>

195
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and our boot heels and
the edge of our knives.</font></b>

196
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,060
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the German will be sickened by us.</font></b>

197
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the German will talk about us.</font></b>

198
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the German will fear us.</font></b>

199
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And when the German
closes their eyes at night</font></b>

200
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,030
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and they're tortured by their
subconscious for the evil they have done,</font></b>

201
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be with thoughts of

202
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,540
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound good?</font></b>

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir!</font></b>

204
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,370

205
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got a word of warning

206
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you join my command,
you take on debit.</font></b>

207
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A debit you owe me, personally.</font></b>

208
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Each and every man under my
command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.</font></b>

209
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,520
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want my scalps.</font></b>

210
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.</font></b>

211
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you will die trying!</font></b>

212
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,900
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Hirschberg.</font></b>

213
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Send that Kraut sarge over.</font></b>

214
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You. Go.</font></b>

215
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant Werner Rachtman.</font></b>

216
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,240
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.</font></b>

217
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,820
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what "sit down" means, Werner?</font></b>

218
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Then sit down.</font></b>

219
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How is your English, Werner?</font></b>

220
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,500
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if need be, we got a
couple of fellows who can translate.</font></b>

221
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wicki here,</font></b>

222
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.</font></b>

223
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.</font></b>

224
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Another one up there you
might be familiar with.</font></b>

225
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.</font></b>

226
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Heard of him?</font></b>

227
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.</font></b>

228
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity</font></b>

229
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,620
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">among German soldiers is simple.</font></b>

230
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.</font></b>

231
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of putting
him up against a wall,</font></b>

232
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,560
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin</font></b>

233
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to be made an example of.</font></b>

234
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,440
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,</font></b>

235
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,440
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">he never got there.</font></b>

236
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,230
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?</font></b>

237
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.</font></b>

238
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever heard of us?</font></b>

239
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.</font></b>

240
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When it comes to killing Nazis...</font></b>

241
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">... I think you show great talent.</font></b>

242
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.</font></b>

243
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But your status as a Nazi
killer is still amateur.</font></b>

244
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.</font></b>

245
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,440
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I assume you know who we are?</font></b>

246
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,860
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Aldo the Apache.</font></b>

247
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Werner, if you heard of us,</font></b>

248
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.</font></b>

249
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.</font></b>

250
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font></b>

251
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,960
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that leaves two
ways we can play this out.</font></b>

252
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Either kill you or let you go.</font></b>

253
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive</font></b>

254
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,920
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">depends entirely on you.</font></b>

255
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.</font></b>

256
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.</font></b>

257
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If that patrol were to
have any crack shots,</font></b>

258
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,900
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">that orchard would be a
goddamn sniper's delight.</font></b>

259
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,</font></b>

260
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you got to show me on this
here map where they are.</font></b>

261
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to tell me how many
they are, and you got to tell me</font></b>

262
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.</font></b>

263
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.</font></b>

264
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.</font></b>

265
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.</font></b>

266
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,100
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.</font></b>

267
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,810
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, just take that finger of yours</font></b>

268
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,230
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and point out on this here map

269
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">how many is coming and what

270
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I respectfully refuse, sir.</font></b>

271
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear that?</font></b>

272
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

273
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.</font></b>

274
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You might know him
better by his nickname.</font></b>

275

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bear Jew.</font></b>

276
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.</font></b>

277
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,810
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard of The Bear Jew.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you hear?</font></b>

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And, Werner, I'm going to

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm calling The Bear Jew over.</font></b>

284
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to take that big bat of his,</font></b>

285
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.</font></b>

291

Donny beat Nazis to death</font></b>

292

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask him how many Germans.</font></b>

316
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Around about 12.</font></b>

317
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of artillery?</font></b>

318
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,240
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, when you report what happened here,</font></b>

319
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,990
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you can't tell them you told us

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.</font></b>

321
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So tell them, we let you live so you

322
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.</font></b>

323

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that you've survived the war, when
you get home, what you going to do?</font></b>

324
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to hug his mother.</font></b>

325
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, ain't that nice?</font></b>

326
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask if he's going to
take off his uniform.</font></b>

327
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to burn it.</font></b>

328
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's what we
thought. We don't like that.</font></b>

329
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">See, we like our Nazis in
uniforms. That way you can spot them.</font></b>

330
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like that.</font></b>

331
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,660
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.</font></b>

332
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Lieutenant, you're
getting pretty good at that.</font></b>

333
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?</font></b>

334
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Practice.</font></b>

335
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Au revoir, Shosanna!</font></b>

336
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">At that time, 35
millimeter nitrate film was so flammable</font></b>

337
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,210
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">that you couldn't even bring
a reel onto a streetcar.</font></b>

338
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you can't bring those
here on a public vehicle.</font></b>

339
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're films, ain't they? Yes.</font></b>

340
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then they're flammable. Go on, hop off.</font></b>

341
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Because nitrate film
burns three times faster than paper.</font></b>

342
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,060
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Shosanna has a collection</font></b>

343
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:02,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">of over 350 nitrate film prints.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Archie Hicox

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox.</font></b>

346
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink?</font></b>

347
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.</font></b>

348
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,340
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself like a good chap, will you?</font></b>

349
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The bar is in the globe.</font></b>

350
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Something for yourself, sir?</font></b>

351
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiskey. Straight. No junk in it.</font></b>

352
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,320

speak German fluently.</font></b>

353
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a Katzenjammer Kid.</font></b>

354
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,070
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And your occupation before the war?</font></b>

355
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a film critic.</font></b>

356
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">List your accomplishments.</font></b>

357
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, sir, such as they are,</font></b>

358
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,500
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,</font></b>

359
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've had two books published.</font></b>

360
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,920
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?</font></b>

361
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first book was called</font></b>

362
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:36,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.</font></b>

363
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.</font></b>

364
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,940
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a sub textual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.</font></b>

365
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,020
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What should we drink to, sir?</font></b>

366
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font></b>

367
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,570
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Down with Hitler.</font></b>

368
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,030
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All the way down, sir.</font></b>

369
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

370
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:03,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?</font></b>

371
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:09,540
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,</font></b>

372
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm familiar with it.</font></b>

373
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Explain it to me.</font></b>

374
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,720
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon, sir?</font></b>

375
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry</font></b>

376
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:24,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.</font></b>

377
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Goebbels considers the films he's making</font></b>

378
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.</font></b>

379
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">An alternative to what he considers</font></b>

380
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,</font></b>

381
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,740
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.</font></b>

382
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How's he doing?</font></b>

383
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,540
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?</font></b>

384
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.</font></b>

385
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,</font></b>

386
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">how's he doing?</font></b>

387
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite well, actually.</font></b>

388
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since Goebbels has taken over,</font></b>

389
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.</font></b>

390
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:09,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.</font></b>

391
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.</font></b>

392
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:18,990
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Brief him.</font></b>

393
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.</font></b>

394

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Three days from now</font></b>

premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.</font></b>

396

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What film, sir?</font></b>

397
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The motion picture is

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion</font></b>

399
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,

400
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:47,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The master race at play?</font></b>

403

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The objective of Operation Kino,</font></b>

405
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,360
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">blow up the basket.</font></b>

406

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.</font></b>

407
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jolly good, sir.</font></b>

408
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">An American Secret Service outfit

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Basterds. Never heard of them.</font></b>

412
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.</font></b>

413
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:30,520
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Jerries have heard of them,
because these Yanks have been them the devil.</font></b>

414
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.</font></b>

415
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Basterds will be waiting for you.</font></b>

416

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.</font></b>

421
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She's also made all the other

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How will I know her?</font></b>

423
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect that won't be

424
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.</font></b>

425

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bridget von Hammersmark?</font></b>

426
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The German movie

427
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, for the last two years now.</font></b>

428
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:18,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.</font></b>

429
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed.</font></b>

431

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.</font></b>

432

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't say the goddamn

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">lt is a tavern.</font></b>

436

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, in a basement.</font></b>

437
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:40,500
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.</font></b>

438
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We wait.</font></b>

445
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:27,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.</font></b>

446
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,560
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.</font></b>

447
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:38,270
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,</font></b>

448

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to know we can all remain calm.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't look calm to you?</font></b>

450
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:56,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now that you put it
like that, l guess you do.</font></b>

451
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:17,310
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not
exactly the loquacious type, is he?</font></b>

01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,860
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">ls that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?</font></b>

453

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fair point, Lieutenant.</font></b>

454
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So you all get in trouble in

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Make bets on how it all comes out?</font></b>

456

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.</font></b>

457
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure</font></b>

458
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.</font></b>

459
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,720
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.</font></b>

460
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:58,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?</font></b>

461
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She chose the spot.</font></b>

462
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that just dandy?</font></b>

463
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,900
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.</font></b>

464
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.</font></b>

465
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,240
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She wasn't picking a place to fight.</font></b>

466
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.</font></b>

467
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font></b>

468
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,910

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing as I may be rapping

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And what would that be?</font></b>

478
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stiglitz.</font></b>

479
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,340
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.</font></b>

535

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You got guns on us. You

01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:37,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The British officer blew his German
act and the Gestapo major saw it.</font></b>

549
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:40,720
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we get into who shot John,</font></b>

550
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:45,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?</font></b>

551
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:53,030
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">l can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,</font></b>

552
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">that the Nazis being
there must look odd.</font></b>

553
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.</font></b>

554
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:00,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called suspicious.</font></b>

555
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,540
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody needs to calm down.</font></b>

556
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.</font></b>

557
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:13,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You met the sergeant yourself. Willi.</font></b>

558
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,550
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember him, don't you?</font></b>

559
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I remember him.</font></b>

560
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:20,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...</font></b>

561
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,270
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He had just become a father!</font></b>

562
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:26,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">His commanding officer gave him and
his mates the night off to celebrate.</font></b>

563
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:35,820
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Germans being there was either a
trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.</font></b>

564
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,660
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It couldn't be both.</font></b>

565
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd the shooting start?</font></b>

566
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,340
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Englishman gave himself away.</font></b>

567
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd he do that?</font></b>

568
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He ordered three glasses.</font></b>

569
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We order three glasses.</font></b>

570
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,810
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the German three.</font></b>

571
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The other looks odd.</font></b>

572
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,400
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Germans would and did notice it.</font></b>

573
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:19,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans</font></b>

574
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.</font></b>

575
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:23,790
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the next step?</font></b>

576
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuxedos.</font></b>

577
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms</font></b>

578
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,540
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">with all the military
there would've been suicide.</font></b>

579
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,800
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But going as members of
the German film industry,</font></b>

580
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.</font></b>

581
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:45,060
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.</font></b>

582
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:48,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you intend to get
them in that premiere?</font></b>

583
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:50,400
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand me my purse.</font></b>

584
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Hicox was
going as my escort.</font></b>

585
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.</font></b>

586
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You still get us in that premiere?</font></b>

587
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,090
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You speak German better
than your friends? No.</font></b>

588
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I been shot? Yes!</font></b>

589
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:22,090
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.</font></b>

590
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Least of all, by tomorrow night.</font></b>

591
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, there's
something you don't know.</font></b>

592
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:47,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.</font></b>

593
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:54,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">One, the venue has been changed
from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.</font></b>

594
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:58,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.</font></b>

595
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?</font></b>

596
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:05,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It probably has something to
do with the second development.</font></b>

597
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:06,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is?</font></b>

598
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:13,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.</font></b>

599
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck a duck!</font></b>

600
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you thinking?</font></b>

601
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:04,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf</font></b>

602
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">makes this horse a different color.</font></b>

603
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that supposed to mean?</font></b>

604
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">lt means you getting
us in that premiere.</font></b>

605
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm probably going to
end up losing this leg.</font></b>

606
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,920
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.</font></b>

607
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?</font></b>

608
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:24,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.</font></b>

609
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:26,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to wrap it up in a cast,</font></b>

610
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.</font></b>

611
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:31,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?</font></b>

612
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:34,520
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.</font></b>

613
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,390
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But I see your point.</font></b>

614
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears</font></b>

615
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:43,530
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.</font></b>

616
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:48,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,</font></b>

617
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:53,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?</font></b>

618
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We both speak a little ltalian.</font></b>

619
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">With an atrocious accent, no doubt.</font></b>

620
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:04,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.</font></b>

621
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:08,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Germans don't have a
good ear for ltalian.</font></b>

622
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:16,020
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So you mumble ltalian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?</font></b>

623
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:17,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's about it.</font></b>

624
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:22,730
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds good.</font></b>

625
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?</font></b>

626
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that sounds good.</font></b>

627
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:31,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.</font></b>

628
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:33,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Who does what?</font></b>

629
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I speak the most ltalian,
so I'll be your escort.</font></b>

630
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:41,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.</font></b>

631
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:44,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Omar, third most. He'll
be Donny's assistant.</font></b>

632
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't speak ltalian.</font></b>

633
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.</font></b>

634
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,220
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?</font></b>

635
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

636
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:58,660
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gorlomi?</font></b>

637
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:08,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gorlomi.</font></b>

638
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:14,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gorlomi.</font></b>

639
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:18,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Antonio Margheriti.</font></b>

640
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:30,020
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Margheriti.</font></b>

641
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Margheriti.</font></b>

642
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dominick Decocco.</font></b>

643
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that American expression?</font></b>

644
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:28,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!</font></b>

646

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font></b>

651
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:13,450
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...</font></b>

652

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">As Stanley said to Livingstone,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You've had a nice long run, Aldo.</font></b>

a long time to touch you.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">would you show me mercy?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font></b>

671
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:18,570

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
Yeah, I was just thinking that.</font></b>

673
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:38,130
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're Aldo the Apache.</font></b>

674

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're The Jew Hunter.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a detective.</font></b>

676

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.</font></b>

686
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:13,750
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Germans' nickname
for me is the Little Man?</font></b>

687
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:18,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And as if to make my point, I'm a little

02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:21,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean, you're a little fellow,

02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">as your reputation would suggest.</font></b>

692
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:33,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.</font></b>

693
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:38,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,</font></b>

694
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:40,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you get what you pay for.</font></b>

695

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How you know our names?</font></b>

697

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Aldo,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I guess not.</font></b>

702

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">there ain't no way you're

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.</font></b>

02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,620
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">for what you've done to his big night.</font></b>

720
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,330
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But you won't get Hitler,

02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:17,460
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you won't get Goring,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And you need all four to end the war.</font></b>

727

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, gentlemen,</font></b>

728

of ending the war tonight.</font></b>

729
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:47,570
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the way I see it,</font></b>

730
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:51,870
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,</font></b>

02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:54,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">if I do nothing,</font></b>

732
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.</font></b>

733
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:58,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't you agree?</font></b>

734
02:07:59,250 --> 02:08:00,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess so.</font></b>

735
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:05,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you, Utivich?</font></b>

736
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,880
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess so, too.</font></b>

737
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:13,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, l have no intention</font></b>

738
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,</font></b>

739
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:19,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,</font></b>

740
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:23,520
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.</font></b>

741
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:29,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to win the war tonight,</font></b>

742
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:32,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">we have to make a deal.</font></b>

743
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of deal?</font></b>

744
02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:40,330
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.</font></b>

745
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:44,960
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.</font></b>

746
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A general.</font></b>

747
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm betting for...</font></b>

748
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:53,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OSS would be my guess.</font></b>

749
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:59,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a bingo!</font></b>

750
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:05,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."</font></b>

751
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:07,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You just say, "Bingo."</font></b>

752
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:09,440
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo! How fun.</font></b>

753
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:14,950
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But I digress. Where were
we? Yeah! Make a deal.</font></b>

754
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:19,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it</font></b>

755
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.</font></b>

756
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me someone on the
other end of that radio</font></b>

757
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:29,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">with the power of the
pen to authorize my,</font></b>

758
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:32,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.</font></b>

759
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:35,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If that tastes better going down.</font></b>

760
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, where I'm from...</font></b>

761
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:39,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Where is that exactly?</font></b>

762
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:41,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Maynardville, Tennessee.</font></b>

763
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:44,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done my share of bootlegging.</font></b>

764
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:48,020
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">U p there, if you engage in what the
federal government calls illegal activity,</font></b>

765
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:50,240
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family</font></b>

766
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:54,740
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">selling moonshine liquor, it
behooves oneself to keep his wits.</font></b>

767
02:09:56,700 --> 02:10:00,120
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,</font></b>

768
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:02,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it ain't.</font></b>

769
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:06,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sitting in your chair, l would
probably say the same thing,</font></b>

770
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:11,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and 999. 999 times out of a
million, you would be correct.</font></b>

771
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:17,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,</font></b>

772
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:20,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">fate reaches out and extends its hand.</font></b>

773
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What shall the history books read?</font></b>

774
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I implore you. We
must destroy that tower.</font></b>

775
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sarge, that tower...</font></b>

776
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:24,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The tower stands!</font></b>

777
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:34,010
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Psst! Psst!</font></b>

778
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:06,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So when the military
history of this night is written,</font></b>

779
02:14:06,370 --> 02:14:10,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be recorded that I
was part of Operation Kino</font></b>

780
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:12,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">from the very beginning
as a double agent.</font></b>

781
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything I've done in
my guise as an SS Colonel</font></b>

782
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:20,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">was sanctioned by the
OSS as a necessary evil</font></b>

783
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to establish my cover with the Germans.</font></b>

784
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:26,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite</font></b>

785
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:29,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">in Hitler and Goebbels' opera
box that assured their demise.</font></b>

786
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:49,660
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, that last
part is actually true.</font></b>

787
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:54,660
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I want my full military pension
and benefits under my proper rank.</font></b>

788

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">for my invaluable assistance in
the toppling of the Third Reich.</font></b>

790
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:05,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, I want all the
members of Operation Kino</font></b>

791
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:09,010

Congressional Medal of Honor.</font></b>

792

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.</font></b>

793
02:15:13,390 --> 02:15:16,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would like the
United States of America</font></b>

794

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to purchase property for
me on Nantucket lsland</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font></b>

801
02:15:43,090 --> 02:15:46,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.</font></b>

802
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:51,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.</font></b>

803
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:55,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa

804
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:58,600
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You will then take over
driving of the truck</font></b>

805
02:15:58,690 --> 02:16:02,070
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring them straight to me for

806

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font></b>

807

808
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,580
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When I kill that guy, you got
30 feet to get to that guard.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you do it? I have to.</font></b>

810
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:25,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Champagne?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants to send a message to Germany?</font></b>

812

821
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:59,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm officially surrendering myself

830
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font></b>

831
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:34,420
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a deal with your
general for that man's life!</font></b>

832
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:38,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, they made that deal. But they
don't give a fuck about him. They need you.</font></b>

833
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:40,930
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be shot for this!</font></b>

834
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:45,100
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, I don't think so. More like
chewed out. I've been chewed out before.</font></b>

835
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:50,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">End the war tonight?</font></b>

837
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd make that deal.</font></b>

838
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:57,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?</font></b>

839
02:27:57,780 --> 02:27:58,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd make that deal.</font></b>

840
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:01,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't blame you. Damn good deal.</font></b>

841
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:05,250
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.</font></b>

842
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:08,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you're willing to
barbecue the whole High Command,</font></b>

843
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:11,790
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">l suppose that's worth
certain considerations.</font></b>

844
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:14,630
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do have one question.</font></b>

845
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you get to your little
place on Nantucket lsland,</font></b>

846
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:23,100
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">l imagine you are going to take off that
handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.</font></b>

847
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,520
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you?</font></b>

848
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:30,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I thought.</font></b>

849
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:32,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that I can't abide.</font></b>

850
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,690
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?</font></b>

851
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:38,650
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Not one damn bit, sir.</font></b>

852
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:42,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean, if I had my way,</font></b>

853
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:47,330
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd wear that goddamn uniform for
the rest of your pecker-sucking life.</font></b>

854
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:49,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm aware that ain't practical.</font></b>

855
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,960
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.</font></b>

856
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:54,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font></b>

857
02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:58,840
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.</font></b>

858
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:25,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something, Utivich?</font></b>

859
02:29:26,290 --> 02:29:29,080
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this just
might be my masterpiece.</font></b>
