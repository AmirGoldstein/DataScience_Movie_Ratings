1
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,939
I wrote it all down:
4,222 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:50,233
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,820
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:56,406
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

5
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,201
I heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

6
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:02,370
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:06,458
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,336
Evan!

9
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:15,675
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:20,305
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:21,681
l'm so sorry.

12
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:24,643
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:28,355
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,357
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,901
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:34,861
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:41,034
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,578
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,416
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:52,712
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,507
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:59,636
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,137
Sarah.

24
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,100
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,062
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,439
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:17,070
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,492
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:26,121
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,165
lt allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,334
Working elevator.

32
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,672
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,340
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,843
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:44,181
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,517
lt's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,103
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:56,151
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,652
Can l see it first?

40
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:01,281
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,867
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:07,871
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:10,624
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,919
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,295
lt's a fortune.

46
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:18,632
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,805
He can afford it.

48
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,977
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

49
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,654
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:44,199
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,243
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,120
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,831
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,292
l don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:57,170
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,969
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,555
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:10,725
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,562
May l ask what you do, Mrs....

60
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,438
Altman.

61
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:18,066
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:21,236
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:25,073
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,951
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,412
Master bath.

66
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,959
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,628
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,755
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,008
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,011
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:49,389
Stop calling it "the property."
lt sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:51,766
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,981
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,692
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:04,571
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,289
That's strange.

77
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,540
What?

78
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,132
ls this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:26,301
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:31,097
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:44,945
lt's called a panic room.

82
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:46,780
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,991
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,327
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,080
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,540
This is perfect.

87
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,875
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,962
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,715
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

90
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:09,886
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,723
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:18,019
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,313
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,731
Why?

95
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,650
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,986
No, but l loved her last album.

97
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,490
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:31,741
Steel.

99
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,452
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,122
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,832
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,837
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,046
Open it, please.

104
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:48,717
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,010
Please open the door.

106
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,678
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,722
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,646
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,356
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,860
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,365
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,077
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,330
lt couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,972
l know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,534
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,578
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,413
579 what?

118
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,582
3000.

119
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,090
patsy's pizza. pIease hoId.

120
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,514
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,274
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:28,775
What do you mean?

123
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:33,238
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:34,823
l like pizza.

125
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,090
Fuck him.

126
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,635
Don't.

127
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:58,930
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:00,891
l agree.

129
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,685
But don't.

130
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,625
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,543
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:31,129
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

133
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:33,340
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,760
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

135
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,221
You know what l was thinking?

136
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,974
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,936
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:47,938
Go ahead.

139
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,445
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,740
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,202
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:03,703
Oh, yeah?

143
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,248
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,418
ls that what he said?

145
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,338
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,549
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,051
l'll ride with you.

148
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,388
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,056
That's it. l quit.

150
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,977
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,020
Come here.

152
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,691
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

153
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,442
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,951
-Mom?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,453
lt's too dark.

156
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,762
Better?

157
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,723
That's better.

158
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,624
"Bypass non-ready zone."

159
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,423
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,259
"Shunt. Enter."

161
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:59,314
"Bypass non-ready zone."

162
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:00,982
"Shunt."

163
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,110
"Enter zone number."

164
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,614
"Shunt again."

165
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,790
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,409
Go, go back.

167
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,706
Do it.

168
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,383
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,135
Amateur.

170
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,310
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,021
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,903
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

173
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,446
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,407
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,868
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

176
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
Open the fucking door.

177
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,209
No shit.

178
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,298
What is this?

179
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:01,760
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,261
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:06,598
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,642
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,729
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,356
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

185
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,485
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,198
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:26,034
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,869
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,583
Right?

190
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,002
l'm out of here.

191
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,005
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,342
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,678
lt's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,013
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

195
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,017
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,894
lt's just her and the kid!

197
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,938
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,149
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,236
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,702
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

201
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,745
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

202
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,874
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,586
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,715
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,553
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,390
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,728
Who are you?

208
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,397
l'm Raoul.

209
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,914
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,790
This is still a good plan.

211
00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:00,128
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

212
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,546
Yeah.

213
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,757
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:08,678
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,764
No family.

216
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,602
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

217
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,771
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:26,321
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,575
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,746
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

221
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,498
But you...

222
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,918
...you need that money.

223
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,964
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,137
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,312
Kill the phones.

226
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,684
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,438
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,658
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,328
Get up!

230
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,211
What did you do that for?

231
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,553
Where are you going?

232
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,149
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

233
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,071
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,424
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,010
l told you. l don't hurt people.

236
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,390
They're going downstairs.

237
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,060
-That room.
-What?

238
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,645
The panic room.

239
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,314
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:16,987
Fuck!

241
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,992
Coming back up!

242
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,588
That's you.

243
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:38,925
Shit.

244
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,476
Go!

245
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:50,770
Fuck!

246
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,441
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,444
Damn it! Mother--

248
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,406
Shit!

249
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,711
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,006
Shit.

251
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,648
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,794
Oh, damn.

253
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,464
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

254
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,425
l never hooked it up.

255
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,598
Now what?

256
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,043
l can't hear a thing.

257
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,754
What do you think they want?

258
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,715
l don't know. Rob us....

259
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,011
l don't know.

260
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,679
What do we do?

261
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,848
We wait.

262
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,809
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

263
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,688
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

264
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,398
Mom. l heard you.

265
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,529
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

266
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,072
-You shaky?
-No.

267
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,616
-Chills?
-No.

268
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,413
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,350
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,269
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,687
Here he comes.

272
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,774
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,818
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,112
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,323
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,535
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,287
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,460
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

280
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,463
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

281
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,178
Do it.

282
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,808
Excuse me.

283
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,145
The poIice are on their way.

284
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,866
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

285
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,080
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

286
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,875
l know. l'm just scaring her.

287
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,419
I suggest you Ieave before they get here.

288
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,093
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,636
How could he know that?

290
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,348
Take what you want and get outI

291
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,393
lf only it were that easy.

292
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,732
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,859
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,485
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,367
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

296
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,924
"What we want is in that room"?

297
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,176
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,803
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,224
What do you know about this room?

300
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,059
What do we know about that room?

301
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,561
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

302
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,996
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,040
Get out of my houseI

304
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,417
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

305
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,381
-Mom.
-What?

306
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,424
"Get the fuck out of my house."

307
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,677
Get the fuck out of my houseI

308
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,685
Okay, l have an idea.

309
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,604
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,652
She won't believe you.

311
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:35,699
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,457
Conversation's overI

313
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,046
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,633
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,886
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,346
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,599
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

318
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,809
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,395
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,273
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,650
How do we get into that room?

322
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,034
What is funny about this?

323
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,786
ls this shit funny to you?

324
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,207
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,542
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,506
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,342
We can't.

328
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,094
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,848
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,142
And why would she do that?

331
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,311
l don't know.

332
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,524
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,903
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,156
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,535
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,120
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,709
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,755
l'm working on that.

339
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,140
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

340
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,645
Small space?

341
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,647
l'm okay.

342
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,692
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

343
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,527
-l mean it.
-l won't.

344
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,491
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,579
l guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,873
Really?

347
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,541
Yeah, l read that.

348
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,086
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,674
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,637
What are they doing now?

351
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,687
l don't know.

352
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,999
They're locking us in.

353
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,124
This is not happening.

354
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,178
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,683
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,144
Sarah!

357
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,135
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

358
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,764
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,599
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,768
We'll see.

361
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,271
Hey. This is what l do.

362
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,399
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,611
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

364
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,372
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,991
Neighbor.

366
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,450
Help!

367
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,870
Please help us!

368
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,455
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

369
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:58,957
Help us!

370
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,845
Help!

371
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,015
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

372
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,310
Shit!

373
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,589
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,384
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,838
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,513
Could you be any louder?

377
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:30,859
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,529
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,200
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,501
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

381
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,882
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,575
Oh, this is good.

383
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,744
This could work.

384
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:08,206
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,255
-Open it.
-l just did.

386
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,215
Open it some more.

387
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,219
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,972
They'll get the point.

389
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,637
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:15,649
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,859
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

392
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,570
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,079
What is it?

394
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:30,830
lt's bad.

395
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,459
They're coughing.

396
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,087
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,839
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:42,259
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:58,733
Mom.

400
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,700
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,995
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,874
Cut it back a little.

403
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:16,960
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:19,129
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,675
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,975
Turn it down.

407
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:34,186
Turn it down! lt's too much!

408
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,855
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

409
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,242
l'm turning it down.

410
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,828
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

411
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,425
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

412
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,761
-No.
-Turn it down.

413
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,483
-Mom?
-Just a second.

414
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,239
Get under this.

415
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,075
Oh, my god.

416
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,994
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

417
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:46,508
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

418
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:12,409
What is that?

419
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,412
Turn the gas off.

420
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,464
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,448
Get back!

422
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,241
Shit!

423
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,495
God!

424
00:49:57,621 --> 00:49:58,914
Get it off me!

425
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:06,546
lt's okay.

426
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:13,887
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

427
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,057
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,194
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:35,242
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:37,452
l won't.

431
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:43,834
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,264
What?

433
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,266
Talk to him.

434
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:04,729
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,168
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

436
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:10,003
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,546
Titanic.

438
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:25,018
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,527
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:43,495
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,081
Get up.

442
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:48,542
Come on.

443
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,052
Wake up.

444
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:08,395
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:13,483
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,696
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:22,868
Fine!

448
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:27,289
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:32,085
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:55,734
Got him.

451
00:53:56,234 --> 00:54:00,197
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,782
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

453
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:04,367
Slow down. Half?

454
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:07,913
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

455
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:10,123
Come on.

456
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,464
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:20,467
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,886
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

459
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,138
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

460
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:30,393
Come on, look over here.

461
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:44,032
Yes.

462
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:46,201
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,165
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,173
-We're here!
-Help us!

465
00:55:00,257 --> 00:55:02,050
We're over here!

466
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:13,770
Help!

467
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:16,064
Open your window!

468
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,482
Help!

469
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:28,326
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:40,046
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:42,549
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,760
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,345
Are you done?

474
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,724
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:54,686
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

476
00:55:58,398 --> 00:55:59,649
Wait a minute.

477
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:06,031
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,993
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,329
Where's the third guy?

480
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,376
l left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:24,382
l earned that money.

482
00:56:24,758 --> 00:56:27,177
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

483
00:56:27,344 --> 00:56:30,597
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:33,433
Got it?

485
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,937
lf l don't come back, close this door.

486
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,813
Just do what l say.

487
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,068
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

488
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,194
Christ!

489
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:47,864
Wait!

490
00:56:51,368 --> 00:56:54,704
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,123
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:00,168
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:03,672
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,465
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,426
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,470
...because l saw that movie, too.

497
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:11,888
What is this?

498
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:15,600
l got some news for you.

499
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,271
Go.

500
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:20,939
Go!

501
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,757
Fuck!

502
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:15,428
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:17,514
No.

504
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:20,851
Charger!

505
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,728
She has a cell phone.

506
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,231
No!

507
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,526
All right, signal.

508
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:32,445
Come on. Signal.

509
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,419
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:51,131
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

511
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,594
No signal.

512
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:07,981
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

513
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:10,609
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
01:00:12,611 --> 01:00:17,407
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

515
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:29,711
Be careful.

516
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:42,516
Get the phone.

517
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:44,809
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

518
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:58,532
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:10,252
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:13,839
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:40,740
Shit!

522
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:45,912
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:48,248
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

524
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,945
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

525
01:02:19,196 --> 01:02:20,280
Okay.

526
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,365
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:02:36,755 --> 01:02:37,672
Okay.

528
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:41,301
Dial tone.

529
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:51,645
911 emergency.

530
01:02:51,895 --> 01:02:54,564
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

531
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:57,859
-pIease hoId.
-No, no. God.

532
01:03:03,532 --> 01:03:04,449
Call Dad.

533
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:13,375
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:03:15,752 --> 01:03:18,880
-HeIIo?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,841
-Who is this?
-lt's Meg.

536
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:23,343
Do you know what time it is?

537
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,013
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

538
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:31,977
Move.

539
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:36,481
-HeIIo?
-You've got to help us.

540
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:37,524
Move!

541
01:03:37,774 --> 01:03:41,027
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

542
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:45,365
What--

543
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:02,465
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

544
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:04,092
He'll call the police.

545
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:06,386
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:04:06,678 --> 01:04:10,015
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:14,186
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:16,730
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:04:16,855 --> 01:04:19,107
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

550
01:04:25,113 --> 01:04:26,406
l'm sorry.

551
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,825
No, l'm sorry.

552
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:30,994
Why?

553
01:04:32,454 --> 01:04:34,372
l was trying not to tell you.

554
01:04:35,624 --> 01:04:36,583
What?

555
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:39,211
l'm dizzy and hungry.

556
01:04:42,506 --> 01:04:45,717
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

557
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,639
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:52,766
Whose fault was that?

559
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,267
This is impossible.

560
01:04:54,518 --> 01:04:56,144
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:58,939
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:03,818
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:07,906
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:09,491
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:11,368
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:14,538
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:18,917
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:20,710
Let's check it again.

569
01:05:20,836 --> 01:05:22,212
Mom, l did it.

570
01:05:22,587 --> 01:05:24,464
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:05:24,548 --> 01:05:27,759
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:29,386
You're making me nervous.

573
01:05:29,678 --> 01:05:31,263
l'm sorry.

574
01:05:32,973 --> 01:05:34,432
What if l keep dropping?

575
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:38,562
You won't. l'll figure something out.

576
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:42,858
You know, he's right.

577
01:05:43,817 --> 01:05:46,069
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:05:46,194 --> 01:05:47,737
What are you talking about?

579
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:51,992
l just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:54,411
l don't need to be involved...

581
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:58,331
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:05:58,415 --> 01:06:01,293
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

583
01:06:01,543 --> 01:06:05,172
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:06:05,297 --> 01:06:09,426
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

585
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,345
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:15,974
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:20,270
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:24,191
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:26,860
Wait a minute.

590
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:30,030
Say what you just said again.

591
01:06:35,952 --> 01:06:38,705
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:06:39,748 --> 01:06:43,293
When? Before?

593
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:44,920
Yeah, before.

594
01:06:45,045 --> 01:06:48,715
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:51,760
What are you doing?

596
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,847
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:06:57,182 --> 01:06:59,601
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:05,524
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

599
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:10,237
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:11,905
Where else?

601
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,493
Travel kit.

602
01:07:16,618 --> 01:07:19,371
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:07:19,454 --> 01:07:21,998
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:25,335
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,420
...so now l don't know what to think.

606
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:30,382
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:33,426
How much is in there?

608
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:37,055
Mouthwash.

609
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:38,890
Saccharin.

610
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:44,479
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,356
Fine. There's more.

612
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,193
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:52,696
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

614
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:56,658
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

615
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:59,202
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,413
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:04,833
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:07,627
What's the matter with you?

619
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:10,755
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:14,426
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:08:14,593 --> 01:08:17,304
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

622
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:18,805
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,391
Things didn't work out.

624
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:24,436
Play past it.

625
01:08:29,441 --> 01:08:31,651
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:32,402
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:36,031
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:38,033
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,953
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:08:42,078 --> 01:08:45,790
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,126
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:54,007
l'll see you, Burnham.

633
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,510
Later, Raoul.

634
01:09:02,766 --> 01:09:03,975
Mom!

635
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:16,029
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:18,323
...think you know all about it.

637
01:09:21,117 --> 01:09:23,370
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:09:24,663 --> 01:09:27,415
Sarah, listen to me:

639
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:30,502
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

640
01:09:30,585 --> 01:09:31,670
Okay.

641
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,718
You should see the look on your face.

642
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,388
What's happening?

643
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,975
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

644
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:46,434
Come here.

645
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:47,894
Come here.

646
01:09:48,228 --> 01:09:50,897
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

647
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:55,402
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

648
01:10:01,616 --> 01:10:04,077
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

649
01:10:04,536 --> 01:10:07,747
Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

650
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,084
Who's the clown now?

651
01:10:11,376 --> 01:10:12,210
Me.

652
01:10:12,502 --> 01:10:13,753
That's right.

653
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:16,047
lt's burning me.

654
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:17,549
Who's got the gun?

655
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:19,301
You.

656
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,553
Remember that.

657
01:10:22,846 --> 01:10:24,764
Find out who the fuck that is.

658
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,061
Give me your wallet.

659
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:32,814
Give me your wallet.

660
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:39,279
Stephan Altman.

661
01:10:45,952 --> 01:10:48,747
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

662
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,918
What did she say?

663
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:57,964
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:00,800
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

665
01:11:03,178 --> 01:11:06,139
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:10,644
No.

667
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:12,896
He's telling the truth.

668
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:15,190
Yeah.

669
01:11:15,815 --> 01:11:17,067
Yeah, he probably is.

670
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:20,153
Because when l do this, people don't lie.

671
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:21,571
What?

672
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,116
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

673
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:26,660
-l can't.
-Yeah, you can.

674
01:11:27,494 --> 01:11:30,664
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

675
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,791
You want me to just make something up?

676
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:35,043
You've got till the count of three.

677
01:11:35,544 --> 01:11:37,629
Then you end up like Junior over there.

678
01:11:40,465 --> 01:11:42,884
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

679
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:44,094
Two, squeeze.

680
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:45,804
l don't know what to tell you.

681
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:47,055
-Three.
-Wait!

682
01:11:47,806 --> 01:11:48,890
Okay.

683
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:53,311
l got an idea.

684
01:11:58,108 --> 01:11:58,984
Maybe.

685
01:12:00,694 --> 01:12:01,528
Maybe.

686
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:05,115
HeIpI Rubber SouI...

687
01:12:05,323 --> 01:12:08,827
...Yesterday and Today,
MagicaI Mystery Tour, The White AIbum....

688
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:12,205
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

689
01:12:13,582 --> 01:12:17,627
Let It Be, RevoIver, Sgt. pepper....

690
01:12:18,086 --> 01:12:18,879
Oh, god!

691
01:12:22,674 --> 01:12:24,342
Dad?

692
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:25,635
No, no.

693
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:39,524
Take it easy.

694
01:12:40,567 --> 01:12:42,736
Open the door! Open the door!

695
01:12:47,574 --> 01:12:48,617
No.

696
01:12:50,994 --> 01:12:53,038
Don't open the door!

697
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,794
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

698
01:13:04,925 --> 01:13:06,510
Open the door!

699
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:08,762
Don't open--

700
01:13:15,185 --> 01:13:16,811
Knock it off!

701
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,023
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

702
01:13:30,116 --> 01:13:31,076
Oh, god.

703
01:13:31,618 --> 01:13:34,412
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

704
01:13:34,746 --> 01:13:35,914
Lie down.

705
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:38,333
All right.

706
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:43,880
You'll be fine. Come on.

707
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:46,174
He's fucking crazy.

708
01:13:46,299 --> 01:13:49,135
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

709
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:51,388
You're a strong girl.

710
01:13:51,513 --> 01:13:54,891
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

711
01:13:57,519 --> 01:14:00,397
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

712
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:02,482
lt's almost over.

713
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:09,489
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

714
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:33,346
All right, turn around.

715
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:37,267
l'll be right back.

716
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:01,643
lt's got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

717
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:02,853
Get your tapes.

718
01:16:21,746 --> 01:16:23,164
Who's this?

719
01:16:27,711 --> 01:16:29,004
lt's her kid.

720
01:16:30,463 --> 01:16:31,923
What happened to her?

721
01:16:33,508 --> 01:16:35,802
Who gives a fuck?

722
01:17:04,122 --> 01:17:06,333
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

723
01:17:40,116 --> 01:17:41,576
Hey, lady.

724
01:17:45,747 --> 01:17:46,665
Mom?

725
01:17:52,003 --> 01:17:53,505
What are you doing?

726
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:57,884
What are you doing?

727
01:18:07,936 --> 01:18:09,354
We've got your kid.

728
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:19,322
Come down here.

729
01:18:22,576 --> 01:18:24,160
Let's get this over with.

730
01:18:31,209 --> 01:18:32,669
Get her, get her!

731
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,598
Shit!

732
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:56,234
What happened?

733
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:58,361
No! Let her out!

734
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:02,991
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

735
01:19:03,116 --> 01:19:04,409
No!

736
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:08,455
-Where's your gun?
-l don't know.

737
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,123
Open up!

738
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:13,668
Open it.

739
01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:21,426
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

740
01:19:22,344 --> 01:19:24,054
She's got your gun!

741
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:28,183
Stop screaming. Stop it.

742
01:19:47,285 --> 01:19:48,995
l know you've got the gun.

743
01:19:49,329 --> 01:19:51,915
put the gun down
and step away from the door.

744
01:19:55,335 --> 01:19:58,797
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

745
01:19:59,047 --> 01:20:00,966
She needs an injection.

746
01:20:02,092 --> 01:20:03,343
Do you hear me?

747
01:20:03,718 --> 01:20:06,012
Open the door so l can give her a shot.

748
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,641
Or l swear to God, l'll kill you both.

749
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,519
lf l open the door, you'll shoot us.

750
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:16,815
So give her the shot yourself.

751
01:20:18,191 --> 01:20:19,985
Give her the shotI

752
01:20:32,414 --> 01:20:33,707
Do you need this?

753
01:20:37,836 --> 01:20:39,546
Can you do this yourself?

754
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:47,262
What happens if you don't get it?

755
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:50,056
Coma.

756
01:20:51,683 --> 01:20:52,642
Die.

757
01:20:57,522 --> 01:20:58,815
Fuck! Open it.

758
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:07,199
put the gun on the fIoor.
And go aII the way downstairs.

759
01:21:07,574 --> 01:21:09,826

764
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,921
Do you hear me?

01:22:04,422 --> 01:22:07,342
lf you step outside, l'll kill her!

766
01:22:08,218 --> 01:22:13,515
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'II cut her fucking throatI

767
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:15,600
Do you understand?

768
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:22,566
Yes.

769
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,406
But please, just give her the shot.

770
01:22:30,365 --> 01:22:31,241
Please.

771
01:22:33,827 --> 01:22:34,744
pIease.

772
01:22:38,248 --> 01:22:39,708
Don't fucking do it.

773
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,711
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

774
01:22:42,878 --> 01:22:44,796
Are you going to open the safe?

775
01:22:50,385 --> 01:22:52,179
Don't you look at me.

776
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:07,402
All l know about this is what l see on TV.

777
01:23:07,527 --> 01:23:09,446
You got to talk me through this.

778
01:23:16,536 --> 01:23:17,829
This right here?

779
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:21,082
lt's this?

780
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:28,006
Yeah, okay.

781
01:23:36,181 --> 01:23:38,058
Nice house you guys got.

782
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:40,310
Your mom's rich.

783
01:23:42,938 --> 01:23:46,233
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

784
01:23:59,788 --> 01:24:01,081
Tap it.

785
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:20,267
l wish l could have put my kid in
a place like this.

786
01:24:21,434 --> 01:24:23,186
lt's not that l didn't try.

787
01:24:23,353 --> 01:24:27,023
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:24:30,026 --> 01:24:31,987
Done.

789
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:35,740
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

790
01:24:36,908 --> 01:24:38,618
He had it all worked out.

791
01:24:39,244 --> 01:24:41,496
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

792
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:45,500
Thanks...

793
01:24:46,877 --> 01:24:47,919
...Burnham.

794
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,719
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

795
01:25:00,348 --> 01:25:01,892
She's going to be okay.

796
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:05,228
I gave her the shot. She's aII right.

797
01:25:05,896 --> 01:25:07,522
It'II be over soon.

798
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,751
Stephan.

799
01:25:31,379 --> 01:25:32,964
Oh, my god.

800
01:25:36,218 --> 01:25:37,761
Can you move?

801
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,182
Not much. l think my arm is broken.

802
01:26:02,536 --> 01:26:03,828
Raise your arm.

803
01:26:04,538 --> 01:26:06,206
Come on, raise your arm.

804
01:26:24,391 --> 01:26:25,725
Try again.

805
01:26:26,434 --> 01:26:28,436
Come on. Try again.

806
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:34,234
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:26:36,945 --> 01:26:39,072
They're going to kill us.

808
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:41,992
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

809
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:44,911
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:26:58,633 --> 01:27:01,636
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:27:01,887 --> 01:27:03,221
The police.

812
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:05,599
You called the police?

813
01:27:05,682 --> 01:27:07,517
Of course, l called them.

814
01:27:08,101 --> 01:27:09,644
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:11,313
She killed the kid.

816
01:27:12,272 --> 01:27:14,566
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:17,068
All right, take this.

818
01:27:18,195 --> 01:27:19,738
Don't say a word.

819
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,912
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:29,789
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

821
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:32,751
Where is she?

822
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:37,964
There.

823
01:27:39,132 --> 01:27:40,800
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:27:57,484 --> 01:27:59,152
She's going to handle it.

825
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:05,283
l'm just trying to unlock....

826
01:28:11,581 --> 01:28:14,543
-ls everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

827
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:18,839
What are you.... What time is it?

828
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:22,217
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:28:22,676 --> 01:28:24,135
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,805
Somebody called you?

831
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:29,850
Can we come in?

832
01:28:30,225 --> 01:28:31,518
What do you want?

833
01:28:31,643 --> 01:28:34,813
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

834
01:28:35,313 --> 01:28:37,190
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:28:37,983 --> 01:28:39,150
l'm fine.

836
01:28:40,527 --> 01:28:42,404
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:28:50,787 --> 01:28:54,291
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:28:56,585 --> 01:28:58,503
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

839
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:02,716
"There are three."

840
01:29:04,259 --> 01:29:05,093
What?

841
01:29:06,094 --> 01:29:08,471
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:12,475
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

843
01:29:16,104 --> 01:29:17,731
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:29:18,106 --> 01:29:20,192
And your neighbors...

845
01:29:20,317 --> 01:29:25,071
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:29:27,949 --> 01:29:29,868
That was the TV. lt's off now.

847
01:29:31,244 --> 01:29:34,831
Can l just ask you one question?

848
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,251
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:29:41,213 --> 01:29:43,381
When you said, "There are three"...

850
01:29:44,633 --> 01:29:46,051
...what was the rest?

851
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:51,681
Look....

852
01:29:55,477 --> 01:29:57,562
My husband and l just split up...

853
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,608
...and it's my first night in a new house...

854
01:30:03,026 --> 01:30:05,195
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

855
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,950
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:30:11,201 --> 01:30:12,661
...was going to be:

857
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:19,626
"There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

858
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:28,468
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

859
01:30:29,177 --> 01:30:32,264
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

860
01:30:32,347 --> 01:30:33,807
Unless, of course...

861
01:30:34,099 --> 01:30:38,395
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:30:42,774 --> 01:30:44,484
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:30:45,068 --> 01:30:47,863
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:30:52,284 --> 01:30:53,285
All right.

865
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:54,619
Ma'am...

866
01:30:58,206 --> 01:31:00,917
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:31:02,127 --> 01:31:05,672
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,178
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:31:11,511 --> 01:31:14,681
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:18,018
Something like that.

871
01:31:21,646 --> 01:31:25,192
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:31:35,035 --> 01:31:35,994
Man...

873
01:31:37,204 --> 01:31:39,247
...you guys are good.

874
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:44,669
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:31:46,755 --> 01:31:49,174
They really train you guys.

876
01:31:53,136 --> 01:31:55,597
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:32:05,273 --> 01:32:07,400
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:32:08,318 --> 01:32:09,569
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:25,293
This kid has seen my face.

880
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:28,129
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

881
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:31,299
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

882
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:33,552
You're on the hook, too.

883
01:32:34,469 --> 01:32:37,681
Do one. Same price for the rest.

884
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:43,436
Stay the fuck away from me.

885
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:48,441
You know how this is going to end.

886
01:34:04,518 --> 01:34:05,477
Goddamn!

887
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,473
What's up?

888
01:34:57,112 --> 01:34:59,030
Why the hell didn't we do that?

889
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:08,331
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

890
01:35:08,456 --> 01:35:12,377
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?
