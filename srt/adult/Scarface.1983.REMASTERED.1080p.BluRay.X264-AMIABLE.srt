1
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,379
What do you
call yourself, huh?

2
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,678
Antonio Montana.

3
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,847
And you,
what you call yourself?

4
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,054
Where'd you
learn English, Tony?

5
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,260
In school.

6
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,642
And my father, he was
from the United States.

7
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,189
Just like you, you know?

8
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,479
He was a Yankee.

9
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,069
He used to take me
a lot to the movies.

10
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,237
I learned.

11
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,158
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart,
James Cagney.

12
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,534
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

13
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,163
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

14
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,815
So where's
your old man now?

15
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,997
He dead. He die.

16
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,294
Sometime. Somewhere.

17
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,465
Mother?

18
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,588
She dead, too.

19
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,364
What kind of
work you do in Cuba?

20
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,845
You know, things.

21
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,969
I was this, that.

22
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,430
Construction business.

23
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,181
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

24
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,060
Any family
in the States?

25
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,437
Cousins,
brother-in-law, anybody?

26
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,645
Nobody.
Everybody's dead.

27
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,776
You ever been
to jail, Tony?

28
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,576
Me? Jail? No way, no.

29
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,074
Been in
a mental hospital?

30
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,281
Oh, yeah.
On the boat coming over.

31
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,747
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men, huh?

32
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,459
You like to dress
up like a woman?

33
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,632
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

34
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,960
Just answer
the questions, Tony.

35
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,254
Okay. No.

36
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,506
Fuck, no.

37
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,389
Arrested
for vagrancy? Marijuana?

38
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,098
- Never, man.
- Heroin?

39
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,396
Cocaine?

40
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,643
No.

41
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,735
Where'd you get the beauty scar,
tough guy? Eating pussy?

42
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,487
How am I gonna get a scar
like that eating pussy?

43
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,652
This was when I
was a kid, you know?

44
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,746
Mmm-hmm.

45
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,949
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

46
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,249
And this?

47
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,536
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

48
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,337
Sweetheart, my ass!

49
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,130
We've been seeing more
and more of these.

50
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,876
Some kind of code
these guys usedin the can.

51
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,462
Pitchfork means
an assassin or something.

52
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,047
You want to
tell us about it,

53
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,099
or you want to take a trip
to the detention center?

54
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,141
Okay, you got me.

55
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,226
I was in the can one time.

56
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,148
For buying dollars.
Big deal.

57
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,358
That's pretty
funny, Tony.

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,525
That's true.

59
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,444
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,773
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,983
Come on!

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,157
So I fuck up!

63
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,652
Let me talk
to this guy.

64
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,577
Please! Let me talk
to him a minute.

65
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,996
You a Communist?

66
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,122
Huh?

67
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,284
How'd you like it?

68
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,914
They tell you
always what to do,

69
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,247
what to think,
what to feel.

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,797
Do you want to
be like a sheep?

71
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,045
Like all those
other people?

72
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,006
I don't have to
listen to this!

73
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,883
You wanna work 8,
10 fucking hours?

74
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,135
You own nothing,
you got nothing!

75
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,594
Do you want a <i>chivato</i>
on every corner,

76
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,178
watching everything
you do?

77
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,934
Everything you say, man?

78
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,766
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,227
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

80
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,655
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

81
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,735
How'd you like that?

82
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,944
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

83
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,406
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no <i>puta</i> or thief.

84
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,244
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

85
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,538
I want my fucking
human rights, now!

86
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,670
Like President
Jimmy Carter says. Okay?

87
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,879
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,972
What do you say?

89
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,764
I don't believe
any of this shit!

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,591
They all sound
alike to me.

91
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,052
That Castro is
shitting all over us.

92
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,059
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

93
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,149
Get him out of here.

94
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,233
You know something?

95
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,399
You can send me
anywhere.

96
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,773
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

97
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,525
There's nothing
you can do to me

98
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,856
that Castro
hasn't done...

99
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,282
Get him
out of here!

100
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,870
- So?
- So?

101
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,285
What'd you tell them?

102
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,332
What you told
me to tell them.

103
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,126
That we...
I was in sanitation.

104
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,046
They didn't go for it.

105
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,293
Sanitation?

106
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,465
Yeah.

107
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,300
I told you to
tell them

108
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,131
you was in a sanitarium,
not sanitation.

109
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,549
Sanitarium. Yeah.

110
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,009
You didn't tell me that.

111
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:03,019
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanitarium.

112
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,523
You was cured.

113
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,935
When did you
tell me that?

114
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,173
You should've
kept your mouth shut.

115
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,484
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

116
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,384
Tony! Montana!

117
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,505
Tony Montana!
Come here.

118
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,845
Come here, man.
I gotta talk to you.

119
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,018
Come on, man.
It's important.

120
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,059
- So close, man.
- Come on.

121
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,349
I gotta talk to you.

122
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,524
Where are you going?

123
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,647
Leave him alone.

124
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,853
I got better
things to do.

125
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,154
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,857
Are you ready
for some good news?

127
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,075
Sure.
What you got, man?

128
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,245
We can be outta
this place in 30 days.

129
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,870
Not only that, but we got a green card
and a job in Miami.

130
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,243
Now are we made or
are we made, man?

131
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,792
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

132
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,418
No, man,
somebody else.

133
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,545
You're kidding.

134
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,876
No.

135
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,176
You're not kidding?

136
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,427
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

137
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,678
Rebenga?

138
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,892
I know that name.

139
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,185
Yeah?

140
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,853
- He's political.
- Yeah.

141
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,725
Well, he's coming in here today.
Castro just sprung him.

142
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,688
This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.

143
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,359
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

144
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,779
But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.

145
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,206
One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.

146
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,749
He wants
the favor repaid.

147
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,623
That's where
we come in.

148
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,543
It's ugly, man.

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,628
Yeah.

150
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,351
You tell your guys
in Miami, your friend,

151
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,686
it'd be a pleasure.

152
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,226
I'd kill a Communist
for fun,

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,819
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

154
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,691
Rebenga!

155
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,357
From a friend
you fucked!

156
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,924
That face.
That's nice.

157
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,349
That doesn't
look like me.

158
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,181
That looks pretty, man.

159
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,896
Whoo!

160
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,928
Fuck!

161
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,262
What's wrong, man?

162
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,060
Your big shot friend better come up
with something soon.

163
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,733
I didn't come to the U.S.
to break my fucking back.

164
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,277
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

165
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,442
Fucking thing!

166
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,819
I told you.

167
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,739
What's wrong?

168
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,251
Look at that one.

169
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,883
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

170
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,759
Look at those titties.

171
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,262
Look at that punk
with her.

172
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,852
What's he got
that I don't have?

173
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,148
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

174
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,771
I mean, look at
the way he dresses.

175
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,403
Come on. That's style,
flash, pizzazz.

176
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,531
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

177
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,041
Look at this.

178
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,501
Fucking onions.

179
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,174
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

180
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,131
Oh, God,
I can feel it.

181
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,010
There's two guys looking
for you out there.

182
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,260
That's him, man.
That's <i>El mono.</i> I told you.

183
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,061
Don't stay
too fucking long.

184
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,556
We've got a lot
of work to do.

185
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,202
Waldo!
Good to see you, man.

186
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,797
This is my friend Tony Montana
I've been telling you about.

187
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,252
Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.

188
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,136
I got something
for you.

189
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,259
Yeah?
What do we gotta do?

190
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,472
Gotta unload a boat.

191
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,892
Marijuana. 45 tons.
You get 500 each.

192
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,138
500? That's great.

193
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,517
You gotta be kidding.

194
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,068
500?

195
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,897
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

196
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,986
The going rate on a boat
is 1,000 a night.

197
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,115
You know that.

198
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,039
First you gotta work
your way up to 500.

199
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,663
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

200
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,915
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

201
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,047
That was something else.

202
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,580
Shut up!
Take it easy.

203
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,254
What's with this
dishwasher, <i>chico?</i>

204
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,009
Don't he know
we could've got

205
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,961
any space cadet to
hit Rebenga cheaper?

206
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,213
50 bucks!

207
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,423
Then why didn't you?

208
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,512
Don't call me no
fucking dishwasher,

209
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,934
or I'll kick
your monkey ass.

210
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,724
Who the fuck are you?

211
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,435
You can't do that, man!

212
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,808
The Colombians!

213
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,106
Okay, all right,
big man!

214
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,949
You want to make
some big bucks?

215
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,776
Let's see
how tough you are.

216
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,287
You know something
about cocaine?

217
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,414
You kidding me or what?

218
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,289
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

219
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,756
New guys.

220
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,380
They say they got two keys
for us, for openers.

221
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,883
Pure coke.
Hotel in Miami Beach.

222
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,509
I want you to
go over there.

223
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,008
If it's what they say,
pay them and bring it back.

224
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,180
Do that,
you got 5 grand.

225
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,310
Go, pay them,
bring it back, yeah?

226
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,858
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

227
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,107
Yeah, man.
We were in the Army.

228
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,283
You gonna need
a couple other guys.

229
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,826
That's no problem.

230
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,947
Be at Hector's bodega
at noon, Friday.

231
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,952
You get the
buy money then.

232
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,255
If anything happens
to that buy money,

233
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,048
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses

234
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,338
faster than
a rabbit gets fucked!

235
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,881
I'm scared.

236
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,717
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

237
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,933
That was dumb.

238
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,932
You worry too much.

239
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,479
You'll have
a heart attack.

240
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,729
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

241
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,068
What's this with
the Colombians?

242
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,770
What does it matter?

243
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,991
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

244
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,194
I don't like
fucking Colombians, okay?

245
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,867
What you guys doing?

246
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,040
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

247
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,871
Wash them yourself.

248
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,210
I retire!

249
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,755
What the fuck
you gonna do now?

250
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,966
Don't come back here!

251
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,259
I gotta look after
my investment!

252
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,298
Fuck you guys!

253
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,720
Close the shop!

254
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,110
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

255
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,198
Are you
fucking crazy?

256
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,617
She's 103 years old.

257
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,369
Not that one, man!
That one!

258
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,456
Which one?

259
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
The young one.

260
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,371
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

261
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,623
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

262
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,251
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

263
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,712
Just play it cool.
Miami Beach.

264
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,798
Miami Beach, man!

265
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,780
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

266
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,490
You got it?
Me, nobody else. Okay.

267
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,620
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

268
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,504
Room 9. You ready?

269
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,126
Sure thing.

270
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,561
Okay. You mind
leaving the door open?

271
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,813
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

272
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,899
Sure. No problem.

273
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,534
No problem.

274
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,739
Hello. This is Marta.

275
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,536
Marta, hello.

276
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,790
I am Hector.

277
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,879
And I am Tony.

278
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,682
So, Omar says
you're okay.

279
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,557
Yeah? Good.
Omar's okay.

280
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,809
Okay.

281
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,904
So, you got
the money?

282
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,784
You got the stuff?

283
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,576
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

284
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,328
I got it close by.

285
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,955
I don't have
the money either, man.

286
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,758
I have it close by, too.

287
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:28,921
Where?

288
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,927
In the car?

289
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,764
No, not in the car, man.

290
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,015
No?

291
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,685
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

292
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,444
Not far.

293
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,655
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

294
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,999
Where you from, Tony?

295
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,416
What the fuck difference does it make
where I'm from?

296
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,297
Take it easy, man.

297
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,627
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

298
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,307
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

299
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,967
Okay?

300
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,135
- What's the story?
- Tony!

301
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,858
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

302
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,784
You steal from me,
you're dead.

303
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,077
Yeah?

304
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,993
You want to
give me the cash,

305
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,545
or do I kill
your brother first

306
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,998
before I kill you?

307
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,425
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

308
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,756
See if it fits.

309
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,885
Yeah? Okay.

310
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,960
<i>Yeah, it's very important.</i>

311
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,565
<i>I understand
it's important.</i>

312
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,309
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

313
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,076
<i>You forecasted
an earthquake</i>

314
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,626
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

315
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,922
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

316
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,057
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

317
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,222
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

318
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,560
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

319
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,614
You have such
beautiful skin.

320
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,074
I like the way you...

321
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,751
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

322
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,393
Antonio, <i>mira!</i>

323
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,438
Watch what happens
to your friend.

324
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,611
If you don't want this
to happen to you,

325
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,279
give me the money.

326
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,549
Come on, come on.

327
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,479
Now the leg, huh.

328
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,327
Let's do it, man.
Come on.

329
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,956
We're all gonna
be all right.

330
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,011
Okay, <i>cara cicatriz.</i>

331
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,147
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

332
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,189
Last chance, <i>pendejo!</i>

333
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,199
Fuck you!

334
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,395
You okay?

335
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,936
Yeah, man.
It went in and out.

336
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,276
Okay, take him
out of here, quick!

337
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,277
Chi Chi! Get the <i>yeyo.</i>

338
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,843
Your turn.

339
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,144
I kill you!

340
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Die!

341
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,783
Hurry up! Get in!
Come on. Let's go!

342
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,622
Close the door!

343
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,464
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

344
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,286
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

345
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,475
You do that, Omar.
You do that.

346
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,104
<i>You still got
the money?</i>

347
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,307
Yeah.

348
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,318
And I got the <i>yeyo.</i>

349
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,274
<i>You got the</i> yeyo?

350
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,571
Yeah, right.

351
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,074
<i>Bring it here.</i>

352
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,158
Fuck you.

353
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,656
I'm taking it
to Lopez myself.

354
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,032
Not you, me.

355
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,223
Nice fucking guy.

356
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,357
Frank Lopez.
Tony Montana.

357
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,862
Tony Montana.

358
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,784
Mr. Lopez.
It's a real pleasure.

359
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,198
You can call me Frank.

360
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,906
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team,

361
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,575
even the fucking
prosecutors around town,

362
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,827
they all call me Frank.

363
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,582
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

364
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,626
Manny Ribera.

365
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,165
He caught one
on the job.

366
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,375
Went right through.

367
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,051
We heard about that.

368
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,380
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

369
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,721
Well, Omar's okay.

370
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,974
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

371
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,097
That Commie
son of a bitch...

372
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,727
You don't have
to mention that.

373
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,649
That was fun.

374
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,852
That was fun?

375
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,186
Damn right.

376
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,441
That was fun.

377
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,570
Sometimes it's fun.

378
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,072
What do you want
to drink?

379
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,522
Scotch, gin, rum?
What do you like?

380
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,740
Gin is fine.
Want some? Two gins.

381
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,084
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

382
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,709
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

383
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,167
You, Tony,
and your <i>compadre</i> here.

384
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,804
Here's the stuff.

385
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,634
Two keys.

386
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,646
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

387
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,687
My gift to you.

388
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,615
I'm sorry about
your friend, Tony.

389
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,951
If people would do
business the right way,

390
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,654
there'd be no
fuck-ups like this.

391
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,325
Don't think I don't
appreciate the gesture.

392
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,329
You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business,

393
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,798
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

394
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,140
And you'll find out
your biggest problem

395
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,184
is not bringing in
the stuff,

396
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,269
but what to do with
all the fucking cash!

397
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,978
I hope I have
that problem someday.

398
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,900
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

399
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,985
Sit down over here.

400
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,111
Where the hell's Elvira?

401
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,113
It's late.
Go find her, will you?

402
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,116
Jesus! Fucking broad.

403
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,667
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

404
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,037
Gotta get her
in between.

405
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,872
She's coming.

406
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,047
Yeah.

407
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,839
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

408
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,885
That's the best time.

409
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,383
What are you
guys doing tonight?

410
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,602
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

411
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,813
I could eat a horse.

412
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,640
Okay, they'll
cook you a horse.

413
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,941
I'll eat it.

414
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,195
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

415
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,652
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

416
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,782
It hit the wall.

417
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,156
I ran out of bullets,
like an asshole.

418
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,708
When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed

419
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,956
wasn't dead
and shot me.

420
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,455
The guy was behind me.
I killed him.

421
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,798
How many bullets
you catch?

422
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,000
Bullets? One bullet.

423
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,379
9mm.

424
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,392
Elvira,
where the hell you been?

425
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,894
It's 10:00.
I'm starving.

426
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,273
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

427
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,942
Where you going?
Come on.

428
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:58,409
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

429
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,122
Tony Montana. Elvira.

430
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,409
Hello.

431
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,835
Manny Ribera. Elvira.

432
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,212
So, there are
five of us.

433
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,709
Where are we
having dinner?

434
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,292
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

435
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,335
- Again?
- Again.

436
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,805
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you,

437
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,133
you wouldn't be
too hard to find.

438
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,391
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

439
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,474
I got nothing
but friends!

440
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,396
You never know.

441
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,478
Maybe the catcher on
your Little League team.

442
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,322
The catcher?
That son of a bitch,

443
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,819
he didn't get
a base hit all season.

444
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,320
I should kill him!

445
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,475
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

446
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,483
They got the biggest distribution setup
from here to Houston,

447
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,856
Tucson,
all down that way.

448
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,729
What do you think
of that, huh?

449
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,861
Look.

450
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,496
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.

451
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,578
<i>El Gordo!</i>

452
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,536
He's got more cash than
anybody in this place.

453
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,209
He's a real <i>chazer!</i>

454
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,010
You know what
a <i>chazer</i> is?

455
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,676
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a <i>chazer?</i>

456
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,349
It's the Yiddish
word for "pig."

457
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,473
A guy who wants
more than he needs.

458
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,179
He don't fly
straight no more.

459
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,856
So, it comes down
to one thing,

460
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,686
Tony boy,
and you never forget it.

461
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,860
Lesson Number 1:

462
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,118
Don't underestimate

463
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,613
the other guy's greed!

464
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,286
Lesson Number 2:

465
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,455
Don't get high on
your own supply.

466
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,919
That's right.
Lesson Number 2:

467
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,792
Don't get high on
your own supply.

468
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,462
Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

469
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,886
Your champagne,
Mr. Lopez.

470
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,308
That is '64?

471
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,726
The best, Mr. Lopez.

472
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,394
Omar, you pour it,
and you bring

473
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,267
another bottle
right away, will you?

474
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,898
Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

475
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:21,609
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

476
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,821
That's pretty good.

477
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,320
For a bunch of
fucking grapes.

478
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,994
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

479
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,674
How you like it, Tony?

480
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,507
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

481
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,838
Like you say, man.

482
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,138
That's good!

483
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,095
I'm gonna get you
new clothes, too.

484
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,148
I'm gonna get you
$550 suits,

485
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,691
so you look real sharp.

486
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,861
'Cause I want
you to work for me.

487
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,360
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

488
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,456
We are going to do something
big next month.

489
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,291
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

490
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,298
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

491
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,678
That sounds like
fun to me, Frank.

492
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,382
You want a cigar?

493
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,811
You wanna dance, Frank,

494
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,640
or sit here and
have a heart attack?

495
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,733
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

496
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,035
Don't foam into
the Dommie P.

497
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,585
How about you?

498
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,007
What? You want me
to dance?

499
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,086
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony.
You dance.

500
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,342
Go on.
Have some fun.

501
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,027
What do you
think of him?

502
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,398
I think he's
a fucking peasant!

503
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,450
But you get a guy
like that on your side,

504
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,244
he breaks his back
for you.

505
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,358
What's your name?

506
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,484
What?

507
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,275
What's your name?
Elvira what?

508
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,569
Hancock.

509
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,743
What?

510
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,113
Hancock!

511
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,413
Hancock?

512
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,077
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.

513
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,912
Flying around.

514
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,340
Where you from?

515
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,258
Baltimore.

516
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,345
What?

517
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,344
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

518
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,848
Where's that?

519
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,599
It doesn't
really matter, okay?

520
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,353
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

521
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,689
I don't need
another friend,

522
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,108
especially one who just
got off a banana boat.

523
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,436
Banana boat?

524
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,321
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.

525
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,273
I don't come off
no banana boat.

526
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,361
You're thinking
of someone else, maybe.

527
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,872
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

528
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,334
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

529
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,081
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.

530
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,458
Sorry.

531
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,042
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

532
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,878
What is your problem, baby?

533
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,216
You're good-looking.

534
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,385
You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs,

535
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,975
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

536
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,552
Only you got
a look in your eye

537
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,351
like you haven't been
fucked in a year!

538
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,932
Hey, José.

539
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,315
Who, why, when and how I fuck is
none of your business, okay?

540
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,816
Now you're
talking to me, baby.

541
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,647
That I like.
Keep it coming.

542
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,859
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

543
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,070
Not yet, but you gotta
give me some time.

544
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,751
Even if I were blind,
desperate,

545
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,170
starved and begging for it
on a desert island,

546
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,589
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

547
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,927
That chick he's with...

548
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,179
- Yeah?
- ...she likes me.

549
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,268
She likes you?
How do you know?

550
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,765
I know.

551
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,396
The eyes, <i>chico.</i>
They never lie.

552
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,981
Are you serious?

553
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,781
Serious?
What do you think?

554
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,364
That's the boss's
lady, okay?

555
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,535
You're gonna
get us killed.

556
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,739
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.

557
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,454
That guy's soft.

558
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,086
Look in his face.

559
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,759
The booze and the <i>concha</i>
tell him what to do.

560
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,722
Don't fucking go
crazy on me, okay?

561
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,224
Just remember last year
at this time

562
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,473
we were in
a fucking cage, okay?

563
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,971
You remember.

564
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,769
I'd like
to forget that.

565
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,605
I say be happy
with what you got.

566
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,061
You be happy.

567
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,405
Me, I want
what's coming to me.

568
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,983
What's coming to you?

569
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,619
The world, <i>chico,</i>

570
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,995
and everything in it.

571
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,584
Oh, man.

572
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,156
This is paradise.

573
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,952
This is paradise,
I'm telling you.

574
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:52,704
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

575
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,631
I should've come
here 10 years ago.

576
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,551
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

577
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,548
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat,

578
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,054
my own car,
my own golf course.

579
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,057
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

580
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,804
A line of blue jeans.

581
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,062
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

582
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,856
How's that?

583
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,985
That sounds
completely crazy to me.

584
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,067
Look at that. Look.

585
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,827
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

586
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,199
We're missing
the action.

587
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,826
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

588
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,752
Get lost, greaseball!

589
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,589
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

590
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,424
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

591
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,552
Girls like ice cream.

592
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,753
Oh, come on.
That won't work.

593
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,759
You can't
do it that way.

594
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,759
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

595
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,809
What was that?
What you just did?

596
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,107
That's what you do.

597
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,979
That's disgusting.

598
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,069
Watch.

599
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,946
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

600
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,281
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

601
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,360
Figures you
wouldn't understand.

602
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,615
But the women
in this country,

603
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,697
when you do that,
they know.

604
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,790
They know what?

605
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,745
They understand.
They go crazy.

606
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,211
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

607
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,459
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

608
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,790
Look at that.

609
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,055
She's looking at us.

610
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,144
You think you
can do it with her?

611
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,437
I think I can.

612
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,055
You want to
try it with her?

613
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,310
Why not?

614
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,021
You gonna watch me?

615
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,818
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.

616
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,563
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

617
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,444
I'm with you, man.

618
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,617
I'm gonna get her.

619
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,914
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

620
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,478
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.

621
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,788
Romeo!

622
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,754
You're looking
very pretty today.

623
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,335
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.

624
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,592
You want to see
something funny?

625
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,844
Take a look over there.
See that man?

626
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,350
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.

627
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,761
I gotta watch my friend.

628
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,517
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

629
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,015
Oh, look at that.

630
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,107
You're sick!

631
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,436
You see what
happened to him?

632
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,775
If I wasn't
a nice guy...

633
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,481
She's too big for you.

634
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,529
Causing trouble
like that, come on.

635
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,032
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

636
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,529
What I try to tell you?

637
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,533
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

638
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,795
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

639
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,044
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

640
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,960
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

641
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,715
That's the one
I rented.

642
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:52,053
No. That's her, man.
There she is.

643
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,721
About time.

644
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,145
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

645
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,813
He told me
to pick you up.

646
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,066
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

647
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,361
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

648
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,199
In that thing?
You must be kidding.

649
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,033
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

650
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,746
I wouldn't be
caught dead in that.

651
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,920
Oh, come on.

652
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:28,385
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

653
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,555
It looks like
somebody's nightmare.

654
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,395
So, you like
this better?

655
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,269
Yeah.

656
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,613
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

657
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,861
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?

658
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,863
Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?

659
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,787
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

660
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,622
He says he's
gonna buy one.

661
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,288
You do that and you won't have
any friends left.

662
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,710
Not that you have
any now.

663
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,537
You're gonna like
that tiger, man.

664
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,544
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

665
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,126
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.

666
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,717
How much?

667
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,299
43,000, fully equipped.

668
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,009
That all?

669
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,810
Machine-gun
turrets are extra.

670
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,972
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

671
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,314
Bulletproof this, okay?

672
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,487
And this here and here.

673
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,010
- Okay.
- And the windows.

674
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,737
Get me a phone
with a scrambler.

675
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,072
A scrambler.

676
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,657
And a radio
with scanners

677
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,743
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

678
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,499
Don't forget
the fog lights.

679
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,502
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

680
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,588
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

681
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,349
I thought you were
taking me to Frank.

682
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,475
We got an hour.
You hungry?

683
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,982
No, but I'm bored.

684
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,693
Well, that figures.

685
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,158
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

686
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,665
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

687
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,634
- Good doing business with you.
- Mr. Montana.

688
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,377
Oh, God, man!

689
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,379
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

690
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,212
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

691
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,554
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

692
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,471
What would Frank say?

693
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,562
I like Frank,
you know?

694
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,897
Only I like you better.

695
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,903
You got some for me?

696
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,074
Sure.

697
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:05,913
Okay.

698
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,542
Okay.

699
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,004
Don't get confused, Tony.

700
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,181
I don't fuck around
with the help.

701
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,568
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

702
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,902
Shit.

703
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,272
Would you kiss me
if I wear the hat?

704
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,447
No!

705
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,068
Playtime is over, okay?

706
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,740
Okay.

707
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,423
Mama?

708
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,422
Antonio.

709
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,007
Long time.

710
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,595
No postcards
from jail, huh?

711
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,611
Gina.

712
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,780
Tony?

713
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,203
Look at you.

714
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,660
You're beautiful.

715
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,376
I didn't...

716
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,123
Mama, look at
those eyes, huh.

717
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,961
Look at that.
She looks like me.

718
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,209
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

719
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:21,795
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

720
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,051
I got something
for you.

721
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,024
It's no big deal.

722
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,029
Oh, Tony!

723
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,909
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

724
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,161
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

725
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,745
Well, no.

726
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,714
You look so good.

727
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:05,013
Look, open that up.
Open it.

728
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,799
For me?

729
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,928
I think so.

730
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,554
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

731
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,019
See what's
written on the back?

732
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,400
On the back? Aw.

733
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,366
Always.

734
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,284
"Always."
It's beautiful, Tony!

735
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,954
Mama is still working
in the factory,

736
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,199
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

737
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,376
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

738
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,372
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

739
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,082
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

740
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,298
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

741
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,254
Then I'll be
making enough money...

742
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,634
Surprise!

743
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,975
All that's over,
starting today.

744
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,473
Why?

745
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,395
My kid sister
don't have to work

746
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,224
in no beauty parlor,
and Mama,

747
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,276
she don't have to
sew in no factory.

748
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,654
Your son made it, Mama.

749
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,448
He's a success.

750
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,985
That's why I didn't
come around before.

751
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:13,824
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

752
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,752
Here's $1,000.

753
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,962
For you, Mama.

754
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,263
Who did you kill
for this, Antonio?

755
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,465
Mama.

756
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,808
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

757
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,852
- No?
- No.

758
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,848
What are you doing now?

759
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,526
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

760
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,854
No! Things are
different now.

761
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,781
I'm working with
an anti-Castro group.

762
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,775
I'm an organizer now.

763
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,156
I get a lot of
political contributions.

764
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,697
Sure you do.

765
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,129
A gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.

766
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,751
You know, all we hear about
in the papers

767
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,555
is animals like you
and the killings.

768
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,555
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people,

769
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,307
people who come here,
work hard

770
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,978
and make a good name
for themselves.

771
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,022
People who send
their children to school.

772
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,815
What are you saying?
That's your son...

773
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,986
Son? I wish I had one.

774
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,823
- He's a bum.
- No.

775
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,783
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

776
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,574
Who do you think
you are?

777
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,572
Mmm?

778
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,083
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

779
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,880
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around

780
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,425
and think you
can get my respect.

781
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,754
You think you can
buy me with jewelry?

782
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,432
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes

783
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,010
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

784
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,016
You don't know
what you're saying.

785
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,268
That's not the way
I am, Antonio!

786
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,933
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

787
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,526
You are not
going to destroy her.

788
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,941
I don't need
your money.

789
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,869
I work for my living.

790
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,994
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

791
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,451
I don't want you
around Gina.

792
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,045
So come on.
Get out!

793
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,221
Okay.

794
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,842
Mama...

795
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,929
And take this lousy money
with you. It stinks.

796
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,305
Tony.

797
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,484
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?

798
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,818
I'm sorry, Tony.

799
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,900
Okay, Mama.

800
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,697
No. Tony,
wait a minute!

801
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,869
Don't go, please!

802
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,995
Gina, stay here!

803
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,246
No, Mama.

804
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,337
He's no good. Gina!

805
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,504
Tony, wait, please!

806
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,208
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

807
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,544
Mama, ever since
Papa left, she's...

808
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,841
Forget Papa.
We never had one.

809
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,553
I know you did
some bad things back then.

810
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,514
In the Army, I know you got
into some trouble.

811
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,345
The Communists,

812
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,522
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

813
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,144
Mama doesn't
understand that.

814
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,441
I know.

815
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,654
I just...
I don't know.

816
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,357
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

817
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,904
It doesn't matter
to me how long

818
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,532
you've been away,
five or ten years.

819
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,791
You're my blood, always.

820
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,541
I know.

821
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,632
Come on.
I want you to take this.

822
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,806
I gotta go back in.

823
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,176
No, Tony. Please.

824
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,635
You need this.

825
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,061
What will I tell her?

826
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,888
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

827
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,315
Don't tell her
I gave it to you,

828
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,518
but give her some
from time to time.

829
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,228
And listen,
you go out yourself.

830
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,736
Go ahead. Go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

831
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,071
You gotta get
some fun out of life.

832
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,995
You gonna beat yourself
to death at 19?

833
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,573
A pussycat like you?
Come here.

834
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,871
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

835
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,082
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

836
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,666
I'll talk to her.

837
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,006
- I'll talk to you.
- Okay.

838
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,222
Let's go.

839
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,513
She's beautiful.
How come you...

840
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,844
Hey!

841
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:51,355
Stay away from her.
You hear?

842
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,690
She's not for you.

843
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,816
Okay.

844
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,094
So, this and my
other factory,

845
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,391
I can guarantee production

846
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,562
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

847
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,223
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

848
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,731
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States

849
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,028
who can share
the risk with me,

850
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,230
somebody
who can guarantee

851
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:41,489
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

852
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:46,247
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

853
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,667
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

854
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,665
It would've been
nice if he'd come.

855
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:52,836
He would like to come,

856
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,085
but with his trial
coming up,

857
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,508
it's hard to
leave the country.

858
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,426
So he sent
you instead?

859
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,004
Something like that.

860
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,340
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

861
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,343
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

862
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,953
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me

863
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,378
every month
of the year.

864
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,625
He picks it up here.

865
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,002
I can sell it to him
for as little as

866
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,379
7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

867
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,058
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

868
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:50,220
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

869
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,225
That means we have to
go to war with them.

870
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,899
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

871
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,852
Why don't
we split the risk?

872
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:03,070
You guarantee your delivery, say,
as far as Panama,

873
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,651
we take it from there.

874
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,412
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.

875
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,330
Panama I can sell
for 13.5 a key.

876
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,084
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

877
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,340
13.5? We still got to take that
shit to Florida.

878
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,516
Do you know what
that's like these days?

879
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,719
You got the Navy everywhere.

880
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,853
You got frogmen.

881
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,226
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.

882
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,102
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

883
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,105
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

884
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,942
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

885
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,614
Forget about 13.5.

886
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,951
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

887
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,586
Excuse me.
One moment.

888
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,389
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

889
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,137
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?

890
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,469
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

891
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,600
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

892
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,983
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

893
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,646
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.

894
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,645
Fuck you.
How's that?

895
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,564
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

896
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,402
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

897
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,952
That's it.
Let it go at that.

898
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,404
Don't worry
about it.

899
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,455
Your head's in
the wrong place.

900
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,827
You must watch
out for yourself.

901
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,079
Why not talk to him?

902
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,161
You think he wants
to give you the money?

903
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,666
Shut the fuck up.

904
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,835
I'm doing
the talking here, not you.

905
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,339
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

906
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,762
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

907
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,368
That's easier to watch.

908
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,844
Close your mouth.

909
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,474
I can't wait to see
what Frank's gonna react to this one.

910
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,639
Just shut up. I'm doing
the talking here.

911
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,100
Now where were we?

912
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,355
Panama.

913
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,029
You're looking for
a partner, right?

914
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,944
Something like that.

915
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,527
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

916
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,745
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

917
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,955
That's my limit.
I got no right.

918
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,314
Nobody got no right
to negotiate...

919
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,125
Let the man
finish, okay?

920
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,923
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

921
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,008
You got no
authority here.

922
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,883
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

923
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,428
Frank is gonna love it.

924
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,008
That's up to Frank,
not you!

925
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,601
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Sosa.

926
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,602
No, it is all right.

927
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,402
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

928
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,399
Well, good.

929
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,908
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

930
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,164
But as soon as
I get back to Miami,

931
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,082
I will talk to
Frank personally.

932
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,253
Good.

933
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,414
My associates can escort you
to my chopper

934
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,211
to take you
to Santa Cruz.

935
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,385
I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.

936
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,464
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

937
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,511
Good.

938
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,596
Good talking to you.

939
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,766
Why not leave
your friend here?

940
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,645
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

941
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,442
I think Frank
wants to see him.

942
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,817
No, that's okay.

943
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:33,613
You tell Frank I'm keeping
this guy on ice for him.

944
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,909
I guess so.

945
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,001
Let's finish
our lunch.

946
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,717
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

947
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,338
You got everything
a man could want.

948
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,096
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

949
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,474
Unfortunately,
I don't feel the same

950
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,851
about the rest of
your organization.

951
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,646
What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

952
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,736
I'm talking
about Omar Suarez.

953
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,946
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch

954
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,283
from several years ago
in New York.

955
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,706
He was an informer
for the police.

956
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:50,858
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

957
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,286
So how do I know
you're not a <i>chivato,</i> too, Tony?

958
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,708
Hey, Sosa.

959
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,578
Let's get this
straight now.

960
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,464
I've never fucked anybody
over who didn't have it coming.

961
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,086
You got that?

962
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:19,844
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

963
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,344
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

964
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,098
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him,

965
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,683
I never trusted him.

966
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,894
For all I know,
he had me set up

967
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,354
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

968
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,861
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

969
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,317
You want to go on
with me, say it.

970
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,154
You don't,
then you make a move.

971
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,499
I think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

972
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,000
But I say to myself,

973
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,083
"This Lopez, your boss,

974
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,004
"he had <i>chivatos</i>
like that working for him."

975
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,548
His judgment stinks.

976
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,053
So I think to myself,

977
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,473
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

978
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,862
"How can I trust his organization?"
You tell me, Tony.

979
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,068
Frank is smart,
you know?

980
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,781
You can't blame him
for that animal.

981
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,788
It's a crazy business
we're in, you know?

982
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,621
That could happen
to anyone, even you.

983
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,964
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank

984
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,424
and work it out?

985
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,267
I'll fix things
between us.

986
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,805
You got my word on that.

987
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,310
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out,

988
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,359
we do business together
a long time.

989
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,699
Just remember,

990
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,865
I'll only tell you
one time,

991
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,035
don't fuck me, Tony.

992
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,661
Don't you ever
try to fuck me.

993
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,804
You what?

994
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:32,515
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million

995
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,941
without even
checking with me?

996
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,110
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

997
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,982
- <i>Coño</i>. Take it easy.
- <i>Coño,</i> my ass!

998
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,190
At 10.5 a key,
it's <i>puro.</i>

999
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,077
You can't lose money.
No way.

1000
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,574
We make 75 million
on this deal.

1001
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,623
75 million.

1002
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,671
That is serious money.

1003
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,798
What is Sosa
going to do

1004
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,172
when I don't come up
with the first 5 million?

1005
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,050
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

1006
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,473
He'll send
a hit squad up here!

1007
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,661
There'll be
a war in the street.

1008
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:11,429
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

1009
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:16,392
You short a couple of mil,
I go on the street for you.

1010
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,435
I make a couple
of moves,

1011
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,522
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

1012
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,400
Okay?

1013
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,621
You've been making moves
on your own?

1014
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,827
I got ears, you know.
I hear things.

1015
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,550
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

1016
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,844
What about Gomez?

1017
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,263
What'll he do when you start
moving 2,000 keys...

1018
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:50,263
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

1019
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,594
Fuck them all!

1020
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,688
I'll bury
those cockroaches!

1021
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,016
What they ever do for us?

1022
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,820
Look, Frank,
the time has come.

1023
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,993
We gotta expand.

1024
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,660
The whole operation.
Distribution.

1025
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,001
New York, Chicago, LA.

1026
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,544
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

1027
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,133
We gotta think big now.

1028
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,018
Think big.

1029
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,733
Like your friend Sosa.

1030
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,490
Let me tell you something about that
greaseball cocksucker.

1031
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,651
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

1032
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,411
You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.

1033
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,335
You don't trust
a guy like that.

1034
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,081
You want me
to believe

1035
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,885
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

1036
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,924
You bought that line?

1037
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,058
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

1038
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,729
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

1039
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,021
Like what?

1040
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,648
Like what?

1041
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,399
You tell me,
"Like what."

1042
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:35,160
You calling me
a liar, Frank?

1043
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,950
That what you're
calling me?

1044
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,582
Let's just say
I want things

1045
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,713
to stay the way
they are for now.

1046
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,640
You stall your deal
with Sosa.

1047
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,639
Stall it?

1048
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,565
Okay, boss.

1049
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,272
Come on.

1050
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:07,988
I am the boss.

1051
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,528
Sure, you're the boss.

1052
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,779
Hey, Tony.

1053
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,748
Remember I told you
when you started,

1054
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,410
the guys who last
in this business

1055
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,504
are the guys
who fly straight,

1056
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,291
low-key, quiet.

1057
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,631
And the guys
who want it all,

1058
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,636
<i>chicas,</i> champagne, flash,

1059
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,059
they don't last.

1060
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,850
You finished?

1061
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,981
Can I go now?

1062
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,005
Hi, there.

1063
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,964
You just missed Frank.

1064
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,261
Too bad.

1065
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,731
Only I didn't
come to see Frank.

1066
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,190
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

1067
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,154
Next time,
make an appointment.

1068
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,276
That's okay.

1069
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,484
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

1070
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,001
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

1071
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:46,829
act normal,

1072
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,962
and just take it easy?

1073
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,668
Come on.
I like Scotch.

1074
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,967
Sure. Why not?

1075
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,848
Okay.
I won't bite you.

1076
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,515
We're all normal here.

1077
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,989
I heard you and Frank aren't working
together anymore.

1078
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,699
That's right.

1079
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,531
I think it's easier,
don't you?

1080
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,999
Makes things easier.

1081
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,662
Thank you.

1082
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,124
Here's to
the land of opportunity.

1083
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,634
For you, maybe.

1084
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,886
You like kids?

1085
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,848
Kids?

1086
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,722
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

1087
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,567
Sure. Why not?

1088
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,478
As long as
there's a nurse.

1089
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,530
Good, 'cause
I like kids, too.

1090
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,578
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

1091
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,034
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.

1092
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,043
Come here.

1093
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,095
Sit here.

1094
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,425
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

1095
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,256
I'm not gonna bite you.

1096
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,060
Okay, here's the story.

1097
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,525
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

1098
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:41,948
I got no education,
but that's okay.

1099
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,451
I know the street,

1100
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,033
and I'm making
all the right connections.

1101
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,712
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

1102
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,583
I could go
right to the top.

1103
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,805
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

1104
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,558
I like you.

1105
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,648
I liked you the first time
I laid eyes on you.

1106
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,563
I said, "She's a tiger.

1107
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,817
"She'll belong to me."

1108
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,242
Anyway,

1109
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,333
I want you
to marry me.

1110
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,335
I want you to be the mother
of my children.

1111
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,171
Me? Marry you?

1112
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,513
That's right.

1113
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,011
What about Frank, Tony?

1114
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,271
What will you do
about Frank?

1115
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,942
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

1116
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,863
Just think
about it, okay?

1117
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,526
I want you to
really think about it.

1118
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,157
I'll go now.
Take care.

1119
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,500
All your enemies
are gone.

1120
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,253
Mr. Montana.
How are you?

1121
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,554
Hello.

1122
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,268
What the fuck
she doing here?

1123
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,892
Come on, man.
She's just dancing.

1124
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,727
Come on.
Take it easy.

1125
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,125
It's just a disco.

1126
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,418
Who's that guy
she's with?

1127
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,997
He's some guy who works for Luco.
He's nobody.

1128
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,798
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

1129
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,343
Yeah. Forget him.

1130
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:09,178
Hello, Tony.
You remember me?

1131
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,473
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?

1132
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,475
Chief Detective,
Narcotics.

1133
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,062
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

1134
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,357
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?

1135
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,903
I ain't killed nobody,
not lately.

1136
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,117
No, not lately.

1137
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:34,951
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

1138
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:38,208
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

1139
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,915
Whoever's giving you
your information

1140
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,716
is taking you
for a long ride.

1141
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,214
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,671
Tony, baby,
we gonna talk,

1143
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,678
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls

1144
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,134
here and now?

1145
01:18:58,025 --> 01:18:59,607
Keep your eye on her.

1146
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,189
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

1147
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,940
- My office.
- Good.

1148
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,326
The word on the street is you're bringing
in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

1149
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,078
That means you're not a small-time
punk anymore,

1150
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,038
you're public
property now.

1151
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,966
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

1152
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,793
Okay. How much?

1153
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,713
How much?

1154
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,890
There's an answer
to that, too.

1155
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,849
Here's how much.

1156
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,397
Can you see it?

1157
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,313
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1158
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,404
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1159
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,576
You know
how this works?

1160
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,909
No. You tell me.

1161
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,913
We tell you who's
moving against you,

1162
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,083
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1163
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,299
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

1164
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,590
And then we step in
for you.

1165
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,347
Got eight killers
with badges working for me.

1166
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:13,719
When they hit, it hurts.

1167
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,516
Same thing
works the other way.

1168
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,685
You feed me
a bust now and then.

1169
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,306
Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.

1170
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,226
Small fry, you know?

1171
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,648
We like snacks.

1172
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:33,276
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1173
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:38,707
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1174
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,456
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1175
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,380
Well, that's not
my business, Tony.

1176
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,752
We don't cross no lines.

1177
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,836
You think I want
this conversation

1178
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,716
going any farther
than this table?

1179
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:56,425
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1180
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,719
I don't want to
see them embarrassed.

1181
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,678
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1182
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,481
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1183
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,437
You understand
what I'm talking about?

1184
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,105
Huh?

1185
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,786
Thanks for the drink.

1186
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,127
By the way,

1187
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,165
I got a vacation
coming up.

1188
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:30,876
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1189
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,426
We've never been there.

1190
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,802
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

1191
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,932
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1192
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,981
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1193
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,750
Hello.

1194
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:03,835
Hello.

1195
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,337
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.

1196
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,213
Okay, Mel.

1197
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,509
You think about
what I said?

1198
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,340
About the kids?

1199
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,466
You know,
you are really nuts.

1200
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,222
I'm nuts about you.

1201
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,429
Why don't you
find your own girl?

1202
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,851
- My own girl?
- Yeah.

1203
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,057
That's what I'm doing.

1204
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,983
Go do it somewhere else.
Get lost.

1205
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,356
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1206
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,734
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1207
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,027
Will you do something?

1208
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,860
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1209
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,078
I'm giving you orders.
Blow!

1210
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:44,870
Orders?
You giving me orders?

1211
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,799
The only thing
in this world

1212
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:56,549
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1213
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,263
Balls.

1214
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:10,896
Let's go.

1215
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,825
Elvira.

1216
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,080
When you
gonna learn? Huh?

1217
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,461
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1218
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,256
That cocksucker.

1219
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,366
What happened?

1220
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,922
He put that prick
Bernstein on me.

1221
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,093
Who? Lopez did?

1222
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:40,679
How do you know?

1223
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,258
Who else knew
about Rebenga? Omar?

1224
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,514
He's fertilizer.

1225
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,604
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1226
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,393
I'll tell you what, man.

1227
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,446
You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?

1228
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,273
It might be a good time.

1229
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,299
Wait.
Where you going?

1230
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,819
Welcome to
my private room.

1231
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,245
Your private room.

1232
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,617
This is my private room.

1233
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:51,372
I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.

1234
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,875
Gina, you taste
so <i>muy bueno.</i>

1235
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:03,764
Tony!

1236
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,215
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1237
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,593
What?
We wasn't doing nothing!

1238
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,019
Fernando, wait!

1239
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,687
Get out!

1240
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,858
Damn you!

1241
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,685
You think he's cute?

1242
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,237
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

1243
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,197
My kid sister
in a toilet.

1244
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,525
It's none of
your business.

1245
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,032
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1246
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,282
You can't tell me
what to do!

1247
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,453
I am telling you!

1248
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,532
Listen to me.
Come here.

1249
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:35,420
I catch you here again,

1250
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,191
I'm gonna wipe you all over
the fucking place.

1251
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,128
Yeah? Go ahead! Do it now.
I want to see it.

1252
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,404
I want to see
it now, big shot.

1253
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:42,509
Don't push me.

1254
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:43,757
I want to see it now!

1255
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,134
Don't push me!
Get outta here!

1256
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,927
Go outside.

1257
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,975
You got some nerve, Tony!

1258
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,100
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1259
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,972
You can't
tell me what to do.

1260
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,183
I'm not a baby anymore.

1261
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,144
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1262
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,321
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1263
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,613
Fucking, man!
Come on, man.

1264
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:14,000
What the fuck you want?
You want something? Huh?

1265
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,578
No. Don't touch me.

1266
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,419
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1267
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:24,423
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1268
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,492
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon, right?</i>

1269
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,473
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1270
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,448
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1271
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:36,143
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1272
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,266
<i>A little bit of hope,
I'm sure, yes.</i>

1273
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,478
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

1274
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,481
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

1275
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,755
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

1276
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,837
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

1277
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,510
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1278
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,721
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1279
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,643
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

1280
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,393
<i>"Lucy, don't come
down to the club."</i>

1281
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,424
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1282
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,600
All right?
He cares about you.

1283
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,269
To him, you're still
his little sister.

1284
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,811
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1285
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,437
I'm 20 years old now.

1286
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,938
I'm not anybody's baby.

1287
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,395
You're so grown-up.

1288
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,534
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1289
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:15,280
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life,

1290
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:19,287
the only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1291
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:23,125
Of course he doesn't want you mixing
with those people,

1292
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,547
growing up
to be like him.

1293
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,625
He has this
father thing for you.

1294
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,210
Feels like
he has to protect you.

1295
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,045
Protect me against what?

1296
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,590
Against guys
like that asshole

1297
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:34,969
you were
dancing with tonight.

1298
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,145
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1299
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,645
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1300
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,734
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1301
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,899
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1302
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,148
<i>You've been
a great audience.</i>

1303
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,074
<i>I got a special
treat for you.</i>

1304
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,742
<i>Here's a guy
I found in the jungle</i>

1305
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:54,945
<i>from Caracas, Venezuela.</i>

1306
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,654
<i>He's unlike
anything you've seen.</i>

1307
01:28:56,748 --> 01:29:00,367
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1308
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,194
Look around.
Go out with someone

1309
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,340
who has something
on the ball,

1310
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,855
who's going
somewhere in life.

1311
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,065
Like who?

1312
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,118
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1313
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,828
Or... Or a doctor,
a lawyer...

1314
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,121
What about you?

1315
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,079
What are you
talking about?

1316
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:44,705
Why don't you
take me out?

1317
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,708
Are you crazy?

1318
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,790
I see the way
you look at me, Manolo.

1319
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,583
Do you think I'm blind?
I see.

1320
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:51,918
Come on.

1321
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,299
- What?
- Look, Gina,

1322
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,470
Tony and I are
like brothers, all right?

1323
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,472
You're his kid sister.

1324
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,224
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1325
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,142
That's where it stays.

1326
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,144
Are you afraid
of Tony, huh?

1327
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,400
You afraid of
Tony's kid sister?

1328
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,569
I'm not afraid
of anybody!

1329
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,818
That's not
the point here!

1330
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,583
Oh, fuck.

1331
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,378
It's not for me.
Don't look at me.

1332
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,206
How do you know?

1333
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,541
'Cause I'm not here.

1334
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:38,500
Oh, really?
Then where are you?

1335
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,050
Shit, you're weird.

1336
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,257
I'm weird?

1337
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:45,466
Hello?

1338
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,596
<i>Hello, Miriam?</i>

1339
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:47,972
Tony!

1340
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,895
<i>Put Manny on, okay?</i>

1341
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,313
Okay. Just a second.

1342
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:52,935
It's Tony.

1343
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,187
What are you doing,
checking up on me?

1344
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,113
Get your clothes on
and meet me

1345
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,112
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1346
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,493
What? What happened?

1347
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,115
<i>Nothing we can't fix.</i>

1348
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:09,115
All right.
I'll be there.

1349
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,826
<i>You're still
on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1350
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,036
Take it easy, okay?

1351
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,997
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1352
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,207
- Nick?
- Yeah, Tony.

1353
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,634
This is what I want you
to do for me,

1354
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,842
you call Lopez.

1355
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:28,013
Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.

1356
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,850
And you tell him,

1357
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,144
"We fucked up,
he got away."

1358
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:36,935
Okay. Yeah.

1359
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,360
Got it? What are you
going to say?

1360
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,358
"We fucked up.
He got away."

1361
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,862
- What time?
- 3:00 sharp.

1362
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,870
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

1363
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,957
Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.

1364
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,787
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.

1365
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,172
So you owe me.

1366
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:02,877
Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight?

1367
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,962
I couldn't make it.
I got things.

1368
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,638
I'll tell you
about them.

1369
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:10,893
You're kidding. What was the score?
Three to two?

1370
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,471
Mel, guess what.

1371
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,397
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers,

1372
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,232
they won
the division tonight.

1373
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,693
That's great.
Congratulations.

1374
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,905
What'd you do,
fix the umpire?

1375
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,410
Jesus Christ.

1376
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,243
Tony, what happened
to you?

1377
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,045
They wanted to
spoil my $800 suit.

1378
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,207
Who the fuck
did this?

1379
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,506
Hitters. I don't know.

1380
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,759
Somebody must've
brought them in.

1381
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,223
I've never
seen them before.

1382
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,013
Hello, Mel.

1383
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,183
Got an answer
to this, too?

1384
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:57,564
There always is, Tony.

1385
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,607
I'll bet it was
the Diaz brothers.

1386
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,524
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1387
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,734
Maybe you're right,
you know?

1388
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:12,743
Anyway, I'm glad
you made it, Tony.

1389
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,875
We'll return the favor
for you in spades.

1390
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,749
I'll take care
of this myself.

1391
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:27,461
What is the gun
for, Tony?

1392
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,139
What, this?
It's nothing.

1393
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:37,100
I'm...
How do you say? Paranoid.

1394
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,328
You gonna answer, Frank?

1395
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:59,164
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1396
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,252
I'll tell her
you're not here, okay?

1397
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:08,177
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1398
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,352
Hello.

1399
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:27,612
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1400
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:33,827
Frank,
you're a piece of shit.

1401
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,163
What are you
talking about?

1402
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,581
You know what
I'm talking about,

1403
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,159
you fucking cockroach.

1404
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:43,208
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, huh.

1405
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,547
You know what
a <i>chazer</i> is, Frank?

1406
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,544
That's a pig
that don't fly straight.

1407
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,262
Neither do you, Frank.

1408
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,684
Tony, why the fuck
would I hurt you?

1409
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,723
I brought you in.

1410
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:01,393
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1411
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,647
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1412
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,899
I stayed loyal to you.

1413
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,906
I made what I could
on the side,

1414
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,700
but I never
turned on you, Frank!

1415
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,406
Never!

1416
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,366
But you,

1417
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:28,416
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1418
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:34,763
Mel. Do something,
will you?

1419
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:41,766
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1420
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:52,778
All right, Tony.
I was the one.

1421
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,949
Please, give me
a second chance.

1422
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,629
Will you do that?
Please?

1423
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:15,213
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1424
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,008
Okay? $10 million.

1425
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,853
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1426
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:27,520
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1427
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,528
Okay? All of it.
$10 million.

1428
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,609
Okay, Tony?

1429
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,700
Huh?

1430
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,035
Please, Tony?

1431
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:44,041
Elvira?
You want Elvira?

1432
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,874
You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.

1433
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:49,837
You'll never
see me again.

1434
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,540
Please, Tony,
I don't want to die.

1435
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,633
I never did
nothing to nobody.

1436
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:56,671
No, you never did
nothing to nobody.

1437
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:58,885
You had somebody
else do it for you.

1438
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,302
Oh, Tony,
I'm begging you.

1439
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,009
Get up! Get up now!

1440
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:04,186
Jesus!
No! God!

1441
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:12,857
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1442
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,236
I won't kill you.

1443
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,902
- Oh, Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1444
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,494
Thank you.

1445
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,698
Manolo, shoot that
piece of shit!

1446
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,369
No, no!

1447
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,121
No!

1448
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,556
Every dog has
his day, huh, Mel?

1449
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:49,898
I told him

1450
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,268
it didn't make any sense

1451
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:57,239
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1452
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:01,869
He got hot tonight
about the broad.

1453
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,413
He fucked up.

1454
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:09,919
You, too, Mel.
You fucked up.

1455
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,792
Don't go too far, Tony.

1456
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:17,168
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1457
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,933
Fuck. You can't
shoot a cop!

1458
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,019
Whoever says
you was one?

1459
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:33,645
Wait a minute!

1460
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,942
You let me go.
I'll fix this up.

1461
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,534
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can handle yourself

1462
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:46,288
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1463
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,455
Fucking punk!
Son of a bitch!

1464
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,875
So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.

1465
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,001
Fuck you!

1466
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,388
Okay, come on.

1467
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,010
What about Ernie?

1468
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,814
You want a job, Ernie?

1469
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:21,652
Sure, Tony.

1470
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,529
Okay, then you
call me tomorrow.

1471
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,077
Man, you got a job!

1472
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,832
Tony! Thanks.

1473
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,861
Tony.

1474
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:06,909
God, what's happened?

1475
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:10,572
Where's Frank?

1476
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,083
Where do you think?

1477
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:22,876
Come on.
Get your stuff.

1478
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,923
You're coming with me.

1479
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:05,458
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1480
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,536
You propose it,
I talk to you.

1481
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:11,294
But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.

1482
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:15,419
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1483
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:19,006
We're doing 10 million,
15 million a month. Come on.

1484
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,220
That's serious money.

1485
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,305
You bank boys
gotta come down a bit.

1486
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:24,431
No way.

1487
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,763
That's crazy.
We can't do that.

1488
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,314
Then that's too bad.

1489
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,566
What am I gonna do?

1490
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:31,894
We're not
a wholesale operation.

1491
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:35,651
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me,

1492
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,983
the harder it is
for me to rinse.

1493
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,360
That's a problem.
I didn't know.

1494
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,367
The fact is, I can't take
any more of your money

1495
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,790
unless I raise
the rates on you.

1496
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,251
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1497
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:50,499
The IRS is coming...

1498
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,252
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.

1499
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:54,378
I'm talking.

1500
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,960
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1501
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:58,215
This is business talk.

1502
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,591
Let me explain
something.

1503
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:02,140
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1504
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:04,639
There was a <i>TIME</i> magazine story
that didn't help.

1505
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,185
There's a recession.

1506
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:08,604
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1507
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:09,807
I got to do it, Tony.

1508
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,107
You'll learn from him.

1509
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:14,561
I got to go 10% on the first 12 million
in denominations of 20.

1510
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,647
I'll go 8%
on your $10 bills,

1511
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:17,776
6% on your fives.

1512
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,653
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1513
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,905
There's no place
else to go.

1514
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,282
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

1515
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:26,365
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1516
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:29,247
Once, maybe.
Then what?

1517
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:32,165
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank

1518
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,339
with 20 million of
your hard-earned dollars?

1519
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,257
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

1520
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:37,921
Who else can you trust?

1521
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,800
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.

1522
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:42,714
Huh?

1523
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:47,343
Did you hear that guy?

1524
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,393
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1525
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:51,689
Stay with us.

1526
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:54,859
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1527
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,442
And I got to run.

1528
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,648
I'm safe but poor.

1529
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,033
How's married life
treating you?

1530
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,201
Better than you are.

1531
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:08,912
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1532
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,539
I'll see you.
Take care.

1533
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:12,709
You, too.

1534
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:27,558
That prick!

1535
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:30,804
Fucking WASP whore.

1536
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,066
Talking to me like I'm some <i>maricón</i>
who came over on a boat.

1537
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:40,071
I tell you what. We don't need that
smiling motherfucker.

1538
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:43,650
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1539
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:47,954
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1540
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:50,201
And he's connected.

1541
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:55,662
Fuck them.
Mob guys. Guineas.

1542
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,460
I don't trust them.

1543
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:20,612
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1544
01:50:21,073 --> 01:50:24,692
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1545
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:27,451
Look at that.

1546
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:28,699
What?

1547
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,905
That cable truck there.

1548
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:33,912
Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?

1549
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,796
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1550
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,001
The thing has been there
for three days.

1551
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:44,882
What am I gonna do,
not look at it?

1552
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,134
What, you think
it's cops, right?

1553
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,340
I don't know.

1554
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,848
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1555
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,602
Maybe.
I'll check it out, okay?

1556
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,773
You check it out.

1557
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,353
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1558
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:05,990
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1559
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:07,408
Okay? Remember that.

1560
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:10,487
That truck could be
anybody and anything.

1561
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:11,947
It could be
a cable company...

1562
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,373
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1563
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:17,122
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1564
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:20,584
Here are the keys
to the front door.

1565
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,540
Go down there.
Give them the keys!

1566
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,341
I'm just trying
to say something.

1567
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:27,466
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1568
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:28,672
I don't give a fuck.

1569
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:31,382
It's 12% of our
adjusted gross.

1570
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:32,683
12% isn't peanuts.

1571
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:33,930
I don't give a fuck!

1572
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,479
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1573
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:37,806
Okay?
You worry about it.

1574
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:38,936
I am worried about it.

1575
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:41,769
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1576
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,863
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1577
01:51:46,074 --> 01:51:47,861
We're not
fucking hungry anymore.

1578
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:50,569
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

1579
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,574
<i>New construction.
New jobs.</i>

1580
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:55,623
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1581
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:58,326
<i>We've put your money
to work for 75 years,</i>

1582
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,457
<i>building a more
prosperous Miami.</i>

1583
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:02,918
<i>Count on us
being here tomorrow.</i>

1584
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:06,172
That's because for 75 years,
you been fucking everybody.

1585
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,134
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1586
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,057
I mean, charging me
10 points on my money.

1587
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,430
They're getting
away with it.

1588
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,931
Fuck, there's no
laws anymore.

1589
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:18,479
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1590
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,431
They been around
1,000 years.

1591
01:52:20,525 --> 01:52:22,642
They got all
the angles figured out.

1592
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:26,146
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1593
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:28,398
True capitalist
if ever I met one.

1594
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:30,198
Uh-oh.

1595
01:52:30,285 --> 01:52:32,026
Did you hear that?

1596
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:35,322
How would you know,
bubblehead?

1597
01:52:36,041 --> 01:52:38,624
You ever do nothing besides
get your hair fixed

1598
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,951
and powder your nose?

1599
01:52:40,128 --> 01:52:42,666
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1600
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,873
Nothing exceeds
like excess.

1601
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,755
You should
know that, Tony.

1602
01:52:47,844 --> 01:52:48,880
I should know what?

1603
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:51,629
What should I know?

1604
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:54,382
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time,

1605
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:55,933
like I got to
know something?

1606
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,385
Let me talk to you.

1607
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:59,020
- Listen.
- What time is it?

1608
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,392
This Seidelbaum...

1609
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:02,015
6:55.

1610
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:03,273
Okay.

1611
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,629
I met with this
guy Seidelbaum...

1612
01:53:04,653 --> 01:53:08,112
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1613
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,860
He's good for a laugh,
this guy.

1614
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:15,161
<i>With a small law-enforcement budget,
how can you put a dent</i>

1615
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:19,833
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1616
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,410
<i>It seems at times
all you can do</i>

1617
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:24,541
<i>is put your finger
in the dike and pray.</i>

1618
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,463
Put your fingers
in a dyke?

1619
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,042
The only place
you can get your fingers

1620
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:30,502
is in some dyke.

1621
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,554
<i>...not by outlawing
the substances,</i>

1622
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:36,140
<i>but by legalizing
and taxing them.</i>

1623
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:41,596
<i>These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.</i>

1624
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:44,436
<i>I am not one
of those voices.</i>

1625
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:46,233
I know that.
But you know why?

1626
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,154
'Cause you got your head
up your <i>culo,</i> that's why.

1627
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,572
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1628
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:54,742
<i>...splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

1629
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:56,699
It's those guys, man!

1630
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,950
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,

1631
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,283
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal

1632
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,038
so they can make
the fucking money

1633
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:04,790
and then get
the fucking votes!

1634
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,089
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1635
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,249
They fuck anything
and anyone.

1636
01:54:10,344 --> 01:54:13,428
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?

1637
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:16,260
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1638
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:20,390
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1639
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,102
- You're boring.
- Oh.

1640
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:25,807
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1641
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:29,061
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1642
01:54:29,154 --> 01:54:30,190
Here it is.

1643
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,816
Frank never
talked about money.

1644
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,661
That's 'cause
he was so smart.

1645
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,583
You know what
you're becoming?

1646
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:51,086
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1647
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:54,544
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1648
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:56,129
Get out of the way
of the TV!

1649
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,966
Dig a hole in the garden, bury it,
and forget about it.

1650
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:02,469
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1651
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,767
Somebody should've
given it to you.

1652
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,317
You would've
been a nicer person.

1653
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:14,484
Know what your
problem is, pussycat?

1654
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:16,156
What is my problem?

1655
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:19,402
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1656
01:55:20,539 --> 01:55:23,282
Why don't you get
a job or something?

1657
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:25,704
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1658
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:29,413
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1659
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,003
Anything beats
lying around all day

1660
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:34,584
waiting for me
to fuck you!

1661
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,712
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1662
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:39,923
No? Frank was better?

1663
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,717
You're an asshole!

1664
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:45,560
Where you going?
Come here!

1665
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:48,473
Elvie!

1666
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,524
I was kidding!

1667
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,564
I was only kidding!

1668
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:55,942
I guess
sometimes married life

1669
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,898
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

1670
01:55:58,118 --> 01:55:59,575
Where you going?

1671
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:00,661
I got a date.

1672
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:03,154
- You got a date? Come here.
- Yeah.

1673
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:10,378
What?

1674
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:11,500
This Seidelbaum thing.

1675
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:13,797
Yeah, it's all set up.

1676
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:16,171
Yeah, well,
you forget it.

1677
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,253
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.

1678
01:56:18,346 --> 01:56:21,089
Stay out of it?
It's my deal. I set it up.

1679
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,758
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1680
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,265
You like the ladies
more than the money.

1681
01:56:26,354 --> 01:56:27,390
That's your problem.

1682
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:30,394
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1683
01:56:30,484 --> 01:56:32,897
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing,

1684
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,522
who're you gonna trust?

1685
01:56:34,613 --> 01:56:35,854
Junior partner.

1686
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:38,405
Bullshit, man.

1687
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,859
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1688
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,036
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1689
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:45,829
You are an asshole, man!

1690
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:49,124
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1691
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:51,794
Fuck you, man!

1692
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:56,374
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1693
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:59,760
Who do I trust? Me!

1694
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:02,425
Fuck him. "Trust."

1695
01:57:05,227 --> 01:57:08,311
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.

1696
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,597
I need that shit.

1697
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,766
I don't need him.

1698
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:18,613
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1699
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:22,324
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1700
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:25,153
I was in that movie <i>Burn.</i>
You ever see it?

1701
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:27,822
You saw me with
Marlon Brando?

1702
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,036
You know,
we're good friends.

1703
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:30,286
I was his driver.

1704
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:31,493
No shit?

1705
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:32,709
Brando.

1706
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:35,664
They shot it there.
Cartagena.

1707
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:37,964
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1708
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,174
Italian guy.

1709
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:41,089
Tell me about him.

1710
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,966
I also know
Paul Newman.

1711
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,492
I worked with him
in Tucson.

1712
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,516
No kidding?

1713
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:48,476
Do you know
Benny Alvarez?

1714
01:57:48,562 --> 01:57:50,519
In Tucson.
Benny Alvarez?

1715
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:51,891
Subtotal.

1716
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:53,314
No?

1717
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:57,443
He's a nice guy.

1718
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:01,982
$283,107.65.

1719
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,820
You want
a company check here?

1720
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:12,204
I got 284.6.

1721
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:14,167
That's just
not possible.

1722
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,790
The machine
don't make mistakes.

1723
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:20,423
Let's count it again.

1724
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,510
No. Come on.

1725
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:23,423
Business is business.
Come on.

1726
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,004
You're talking
$1,500 here.

1727
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:29,175
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1728
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:32,039
I'll count it
again for you.

1729
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,224
No, come on.

1730
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:36,144
This check here,
where does this check go?

1731
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:40,940
Montana Realty Company.

1732
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,031
Montana what?

1733
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,152
Montana Realty Company.

1734
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:47,986
Montana Realty Company.

1735
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:49,820
That's 284.

1736
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:51,871
284,600.

1737
01:58:52,834 --> 01:58:55,326
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1738
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,628
Me and Benny
have lunch together.

1739
01:58:57,714 --> 01:58:59,876
He probably knows me.

1740
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:02,007
You ask him.

1741
01:59:20,028 --> 01:59:21,564
We're up to what?

1742
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:29,236
Seven checks.
$1,325,623.

1743
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,077
200,000 more.

1744
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,290
We ought to take a leak.

1745
01:59:35,377 --> 01:59:36,377
Freeze!

1746
01:59:36,461 --> 01:59:37,793
Get your hands up!

1747
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:39,457
Go against the wall,
turn around.

1748
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:40,589
You're not kidding.

1749
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:43,879
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1750
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,630
You have the right
to remain silent.

1751
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:48,300
Anything you say can and will be
taken against you.

1752
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:50,138
How do I know
you guys are cops?

1753
01:59:50,225 --> 01:59:51,887
What's that say, asshole?

1754
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:56,304
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1755
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:57,850
You call yourself
a Cuban?

1756
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,773
You make a real
Cuban throw up!

1757
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:02,063
Call your dog
off me, Seidelbaum.

1758
02:00:02,445 --> 02:00:03,777
I want to call
my lawyer.

1759
02:00:03,863 --> 02:00:05,604
Lot of good
he's gonna do you.

1760
02:00:05,782 --> 02:00:07,990
You see that eye
there in the clock?

1761
02:00:08,326 --> 02:00:10,283
Say, "Hi, honey."

1762
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:13,366
<i>That's pretty cute.
Look at that.</i>

1763
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:15,664
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

1764
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:18,079
<i>I was supposed
to meet this chick at 3:00.</i>

1765
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,001
<i>You're a fucking
pain in the ass.</i>

1766
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:22,125
<i>All right, Benny,
kill it.</i>

1767
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,671
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1768
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:28,006
I know all that
bullshit, Seidelbaum!

1769
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:29,470
Save your breath.

1770
02:00:29,806 --> 02:00:32,514
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1771
02:00:33,017 --> 02:00:35,350
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1772
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:39,143
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1773
02:00:39,816 --> 02:00:43,685
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer

1774
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:48,072
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1775
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:51,158
So dress warm.

1776
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:59,291
<i>Give me a check
for 100 grand, plus 300 in cash.</i>

1777
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:02,579
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1778
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:06,499
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion,

1779
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:09,381
and they'll get it.

1780
02:01:13,349 --> 02:01:15,682
So, what am I
looking at here?

1781
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:20,145
Five years.
You'll be out in three.

1782
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:22,894
Maybe less,
if I can make a deal.

1783
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,063
Three fucking years!

1784
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:29,734
For what?

1785
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,650
Washing money?

1786
02:01:32,744 --> 02:01:34,346
The fucking country was
built on washed money.

1787
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:35,736
Can't be that bad.

1788
02:01:35,872 --> 02:01:36,953
It's not like Cuba.

1789
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,281
What the fuck
you talking?

1790
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,115
The jails
are like hotels.

1791
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:41,576
You kidding me or what?

1792
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:43,122
You fucking high or what?

1793
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,545
I'll delay the trial.

1794
02:01:44,756 --> 02:01:47,840
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1795
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:49,087
Fuck you, man!

1796
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,176
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1797
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:53,094
No way. I been there.

1798
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:00,094
Okay, look.

1799
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:06,642
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1800
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:10,275
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1801
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:16,402
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1802
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:19,743
I'm an expert at
raising that doubt.

1803
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:21,495
But when you got
1.3 million

1804
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:24,835
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,

1805
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:27,838
honey baby, it's hard
to convince a jury

1806
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:29,506
you found it
in a taxicab.

1807
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:55,654
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1808
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:56,866
I really appreciate it.

1809
02:02:56,953 --> 02:02:58,660
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1810
02:02:58,955 --> 02:03:00,867
Oh, great.
How's your wife?

1811
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,038
Three more months.

1812
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,369
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

1813
02:03:03,459 --> 02:03:04,620
How about you?

1814
02:03:04,711 --> 02:03:07,419
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1815
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:08,586
I'm working on it.

1816
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,505
You have to
work harder. Come.

1817
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:13,042
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1818
02:03:17,974 --> 02:03:19,260
This is Pedro Quinn,

1819
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:21,342
chairman of the Andes
Sugar Corporation.

1820
02:03:21,477 --> 02:03:22,763
Pleasure meeting you.

1821
02:03:22,854 --> 02:03:23,935
Nice to meet you.

1822
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:27,390
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1823
02:03:28,902 --> 02:03:30,109
Pleasure.

1824
02:03:30,194 --> 02:03:32,231
This is Ariel Bleyer,

1825
02:03:32,363 --> 02:03:35,322
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1826
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:41,407
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1827
02:03:41,706 --> 02:03:42,742
Nice to meet you.

1828
02:03:42,832 --> 02:03:44,323
How do you do,
Mr. Montana?

1829
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:46,867
Sit here, Tony.

1830
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:51,914
Gentlemen.

1831
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:57,757
I would like to
discuss something

1832
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,839
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1833
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,891
You have a problem, Tony.

1834
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:06,937
We have a problem.

1835
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:10,850
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1836
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:15,650
We all know you have tax troubles
in your country

1837
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:18,448
and that you may have to do
a little time.

1838
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:20,659
We have friends
in Washington

1839
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:23,829
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1840
02:04:23,915 --> 02:04:27,454
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine,

1841
02:04:28,252 --> 02:04:30,369
but there will be
no prison.

1842
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:32,047
Okay.

1843
02:04:32,966 --> 02:04:34,923
So what's
your problem, Alex?

1844
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,756
I'll show you
my problem.

1845
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:41,468
<i>I've heard about financial
support your government receives</i>

1846
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:43,389
<i>from the drug industry
in Bolivia.</i>

1847
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:46,765
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money,</i>

1848
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:48,387
<i>which is
in the billions,</i>

1849
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:50,347
<i>is coming
from your country.</i>

1850
02:04:50,441 --> 02:04:54,276
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product,</i>

1851
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:56,145
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1852
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,550
<i>On one hand,
you're saying the U.S. government</i>

1853
02:04:58,574 --> 02:05:00,691
<i>is spending millions
to eliminate</i>

1854
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:02,902
<i>the flow of drugs
onto our streets.</i>

1855
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:04,778
<i>At the same time,</i>

1856
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:07,748
<i>we are doing business
with the same government</i>

1857
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:10,497
<i>that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.</i>

1858
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:13,420
<i>Let me show you a few
of the other characters</i>

1859
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:15,748
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

1860
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:18,255
<i>My organization
just recently traced</i>

1861
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:21,132
<i>a large purchase
by this man.</i>

1862
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:25,425
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1863
02:05:25,685 --> 02:05:28,928
<i>He is the Minister of
the Defense of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1864
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:31,852
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago</i>

1865
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:36,777
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1866
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,590
<i>Now, if Cucombre
is supposed to be</i>

1867
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:39,774
<i>the Bolivian
Defense Minister,</i>

1868
02:05:39,824 --> 02:05:42,066
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

1869
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,651
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1870
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:47,746
<i>This man here,
Alejandro Sosa,</i>

1871
02:05:47,832 --> 02:05:49,118
<i>a very interesting character.</i>

1872
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:50,995
<i>He's a wealthy landowner,</i>

1873
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,665
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

1874
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:57,957
<i>But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord</i>

1875
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:00,960
<i>of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.</i>

1876
02:06:01,054 --> 02:06:03,637
<i>He's not your
ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1877
02:06:04,182 --> 02:06:06,219
<i>Well,
discussing it openly...</i>

1878
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:10,390
He's scheduled
for <i>60 Minutes</i> next.

1879
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:16,521
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1880
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:20,024
People everywhere are starting
to listen to him.

1881
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:22,197
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1882
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,697
That is our problem.

1883
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,574
You remember Alberto,
don't you?

1884
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:34,626
How could I forget him?

1885
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:38,706
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1886
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:42,084
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1887
02:06:43,888 --> 02:06:45,845
But he doesn't
speak English.

1888
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:49,592
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1889
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,809
He needs a little help.

1890
02:06:54,023 --> 02:06:55,935
Is that a problem, Tony?

1891
02:07:01,864 --> 02:07:03,480
No problem.

1892
02:07:06,035 --> 02:07:07,151
Good.

1893
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:26,462
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1894
02:07:26,848 --> 02:07:29,841
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1895
02:07:30,059 --> 02:07:33,348
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1896
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,391
Politics.

1897
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:43,483
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1898
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:46,406
Run things for me.

1899
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,322
I gotta go to
New York next week.

1900
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:56,909
Fuck this, man.

1901
02:07:57,044 --> 02:07:59,912
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1902
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:01,709
You don't like it?

1903
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:08,003
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

1904
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:11,841
With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?

1905
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,266
With Seidelbaum?

1906
02:08:13,394 --> 02:08:15,602
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1907
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,431
How do you connect
those two?

1908
02:08:18,858 --> 02:08:21,441
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1909
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:23,606
I'm not hungry.

1910
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,361
You're not hungry?

1911
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:27,280
Do you even know
about the trial?

1912
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,157
What did you
order it for, then?

1913
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:31,576
I lost my appetite.

1914
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,287
Do you even know
that Sheffield said

1915
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:40,539
he can get you
a postponement?

1916
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:52,094
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1917
02:08:55,311 --> 02:08:58,725
Eating, drinking,

1918
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:01,394
fucking, sucking...

1919
02:09:01,484 --> 02:09:02,816
Come on, man.

1920
02:09:02,902 --> 02:09:04,234
Snorting?

1921
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:05,481
Then what?

1922
02:09:07,156 --> 02:09:08,988
Tell me. Then what?

1923
02:09:09,951 --> 02:09:14,446
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1924
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:18,619
You got tits,
you need a bra.

1925
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:20,996
They got hair on them.

1926
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:25,589
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it

1927
02:09:25,675 --> 02:09:27,758
and you're eating
this fucking shit

1928
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:31,800
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1929
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:34,677
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1930
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,683
Is this what
it's all about?

1931
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:37,850
Forget it.

1932
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:41,013
This what I work for?
Tell me.

1933
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:47,853
Look at that.

1934
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:50,280
A junkie.

1935
02:09:52,034 --> 02:09:56,404
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1936
02:09:57,581 --> 02:10:01,370
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.

1937
02:10:03,045 --> 02:10:04,331
Wakes up
with a Quaalude...

1938
02:10:04,422 --> 02:10:05,708
Don't pick on her, man.

1939
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:09,550
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1940
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:13,633
I can't even
have a kid with her.

1941
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,431
Her womb
is so polluted,

1942
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:19,518
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

1943
02:10:19,603 --> 02:10:21,936
You son of a bitch!

1944
02:10:22,898 --> 02:10:24,560
You fuck!

1945
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,311
You shouldn't talk
like that.

1946
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:28,610
How dare you talk
to me like that!

1947
02:10:29,905 --> 02:10:32,272
What makes you
so much better than me?

1948
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:34,028
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1949
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,360
You deal drugs
and you kill people.

1950
02:10:36,454 --> 02:10:37,740
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.

1951
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,747
Real contribution
to human history.

1952
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:42,241
Go ahead.
Tell everybody.

1953
02:10:42,335 --> 02:10:43,667
You want a kid?

1954
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,085
Tell the world.

1955
02:10:45,212 --> 02:10:48,080
What kind of a father
would you make?

1956
02:10:49,425 --> 02:10:51,883
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1957
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:55,588
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1958
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:58,965
You don't know
how to be a husband!

1959
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,060
Sit down before I...

1960
02:11:00,144 --> 02:11:02,636
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs

1961
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:04,434
hanging around
all the time?

1962
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:08,559
I have Nick "The Pig"
as a friend.

1963
02:11:10,071 --> 02:11:13,064
What kind of life
is that?

1964
02:11:17,495 --> 02:11:18,952
Can't you see

1965
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:23,998
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1966
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,247
We're not winners,
we're losers.

1967
02:11:28,255 --> 02:11:29,996
Go home.
You're stoned.

1968
02:11:30,091 --> 02:11:32,299
I'm not stoned,
you're stoned.

1969
02:11:32,593 --> 02:11:33,674
Get her out of here.

1970
02:11:33,761 --> 02:11:34,968
Come on.

1971
02:11:37,348 --> 02:11:39,260
I'm not going home
with you.

1972
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,805
I'm not going home
with anybody.

1973
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:46,183
I'm going home alone.

1974
02:11:51,862 --> 02:11:53,194
I'm leaving you.

1975
02:11:55,699 --> 02:11:57,691
I don't need
this shit anymore.

1976
02:11:58,202 --> 02:11:59,989
Okay, but I'll
walk you out.

1977
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:01,286
I'll take her home
in a cab.

1978
02:12:01,372 --> 02:12:03,614
Let her go.

1979
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:07,042
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1980
02:12:14,593 --> 02:12:16,175
What're you looking at?

1981
02:12:23,144 --> 02:12:25,511
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1982
02:12:26,856 --> 02:12:28,347
You know why?

1983
02:12:30,234 --> 02:12:33,477
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1984
02:12:37,032 --> 02:12:39,365
You need people like me.

1985
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:46,576
You need people like me

1986
02:12:46,667 --> 02:12:49,375
so you can point
your fucking fingers

1987
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,253
and say,
"That's the bad guy."

1988
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:58,961
So, what does
that make you?

1989
02:12:59,597 --> 02:13:00,633
Good?

1990
02:13:03,517 --> 02:13:05,258
You're not good.

1991
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,392
You just know
how to hide,

1992
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:12,394
how to lie.

1993
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:18,484
Me, I don't have
that problem.

1994
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:23,410
Me, I always
tell the truth.

1995
02:13:25,122 --> 02:13:26,829
Even when I lie.

1996
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:38,546
So say good night
to the bad guy!

1997
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:40,419
Come on.

1998
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,508
The last time you gonna see a bad guy
like this again,

1999
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:46,967
let me tell you.

2000
02:13:48,187 --> 02:13:51,555
Come on. Make way
for the bad guy.

2001
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,517
There's a bad guy
coming through!

2002
02:13:56,278 --> 02:13:57,940
Better get out
of his way!

2003
02:15:25,451 --> 02:15:29,161
No. You tell Sheffield
to keep his nose out of it.

2004
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:30,703
There's gonna be no trial.

2005
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:32,701
I got it all
under control now.

2006
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:35,208
Just tell him to
stay out of it!

2007
02:15:35,753 --> 02:15:38,166
Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?

2008
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:42,961
Yeah, all right.

2009
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,141
Tony,
everything go okay?

2010
02:16:00,486 --> 02:16:02,273
Yeah,
everything is roses.

2011
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:07,990
Ernie, what time
do you got?

2012
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:10,026
Ten to.

2013
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:11,156
Ten to.

2014
02:16:11,246 --> 02:16:12,487
Where is this guy, man?

2015
02:16:12,581 --> 02:16:13,822
I gotta call
Manny again.

2016
02:16:15,417 --> 02:16:16,953
You don't tell me
what to do here!

2017
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:18,044
He's coming out.

2018
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,289
He's coming.

2019
02:16:20,631 --> 02:16:21,792
I don't give a fuck.

2020
02:16:21,882 --> 02:16:22,998
It's him, man.

2021
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:32,724
I don't care
where you blow him up.

2022
02:16:33,352 --> 02:16:34,843
Tell me when, okay?

2023
02:16:36,647 --> 02:16:39,481
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.

2024
02:16:49,702 --> 02:16:51,819
I heard you
the first time.

2025
02:16:51,912 --> 02:16:54,199
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

2026
02:16:58,085 --> 02:17:00,327
This fucking guy,
I'm telling you.

2027
02:17:02,965 --> 02:17:04,706
Look.
Here he comes.

2028
02:17:07,636 --> 02:17:09,719
Where's he going?

2029
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:11,637
What's he doing
that way?

2030
02:17:23,026 --> 02:17:24,688
What the fuck he doing?

2031
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,583
What the fuck is that?
Come here.

2032
02:17:40,669 --> 02:17:42,752
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

2033
02:17:42,838 --> 02:17:45,171
She did,
every fucking day.

2034
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:46,714
I don't know
what's going on.

2035
02:17:49,136 --> 02:17:52,971
No fucking way. No fucking way.
That's it!

2036
02:18:05,611 --> 02:18:07,568
This fucking guy.

2037
02:18:44,817 --> 02:18:46,809
Fuck you,
you fucking vulture.

2038
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,988
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

2039
02:18:55,828 --> 02:18:57,820
This is so fucking bad.

2040
02:19:01,708 --> 02:19:03,791
I see them, all right?
I see them!

2041
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:11,090
Shut the fuck up, okay?

2042
02:19:23,772 --> 02:19:27,436
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

2043
02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:29,066
You gotta hide
with that shit...

2044
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:31,986
He's getting up.
Let's do it.

2045
02:19:32,072 --> 02:19:33,688
Make you feel good?

2046
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,407
Make you feel good
to kill a mama and her kids?

2047
02:19:36,493 --> 02:19:37,654
Make you feel big.

2048
02:19:39,079 --> 02:19:40,945
Like you, big man!
Fuck you!

2049
02:19:41,665 --> 02:19:43,076
What do you think I am?

2050
02:19:43,166 --> 02:19:45,328
You think I kill
two kids and a woman?

2051
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:48,916
Fuck that! I don't need that
shit in my life!

2052
02:19:51,258 --> 02:19:53,215
You die, motherfucker!

2053
02:19:58,181 --> 02:19:59,672
What do you think
I am, huh?

2054
02:19:59,766 --> 02:20:01,928
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

2055
02:20:02,227 --> 02:20:05,766
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

2056
02:20:05,981 --> 02:20:08,268
I told you,
no fucking kids!

2057
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,982
No, but you
wouldn't listen!

2058
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:12,526
You stupid fuck!
Look at you now.

2059
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:20,322
Nick,
where the fuck you been?

2060
02:20:21,622 --> 02:20:23,033
On a delivery?

2061
02:20:23,874 --> 02:20:25,831
Where the hell
is Manny?

2062
02:20:25,918 --> 02:20:27,784
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

2063
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:30,291
I don't know, Tony.

2064
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:32,212
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

2065
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:33,506
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

2066
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:34,753
He's gone?
What? Where?

2067
02:20:34,843 --> 02:20:38,757
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

2068
02:20:38,889 --> 02:20:41,222
You can't trust
nobody anymore!

2069
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:44,722
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

2070
02:20:44,811 --> 02:20:45,927
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

2071
02:20:46,021 --> 02:20:47,057
He took off?

2072
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:49,097
<i>Are you all right?</i>

2073
02:20:49,191 --> 02:20:51,228
No, I'm not all right!
I'm pissed!

2074
02:20:51,318 --> 02:20:52,479
When I get back there,

2075
02:20:52,569 --> 02:20:54,606
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

2076
02:20:54,696 --> 02:20:56,107
<i>When you coming back?</i>

2077
02:20:56,198 --> 02:20:57,530
I'm coming back tonight!

2078
02:20:57,866 --> 02:20:59,949
This fucking cocksucker.

2079
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:04,947
Tony, your mama called.
Gina's gone.

2080
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:07,991
Gone? Where?

2081
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,951
<i>She got to see you
right away.</i>

2082
02:21:10,045 --> 02:21:13,755
Tell her
I'll call her tonight.

2083
02:21:13,966 --> 02:21:17,130
Listen to me. What about Elvie?
She call?

2084
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:18,376
<i>No.</i>

2085
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:19,551
No.

2086
02:21:19,638 --> 02:21:21,379
Okay, listen to me.

2087
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:23,806
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

2088
02:21:23,892 --> 02:21:26,054
Okay?
Just tell her that.

2089
02:21:49,876 --> 02:21:51,708
- You hear from Manny?
- No.

2090
02:21:51,795 --> 02:21:53,661
Your mama called,
she gotta see you.

2091
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:57,874
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

2092
02:21:57,968 --> 02:21:59,675
Get him on the phone.
Elvie call?

2093
02:21:59,761 --> 02:22:00,761
No.

2094
02:22:03,807 --> 02:22:06,766
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

2095
02:22:06,852 --> 02:22:07,933
I want him here now!
Okay?

2096
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:09,056
Okay.

2097
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:12,310
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

2098
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:31,412
Yeah? Mama.
Yeah, I know.

2099
02:22:32,335 --> 02:22:34,998
They told me.

2100
02:22:35,088 --> 02:22:37,045
Okay. I'm coming over.

2101
02:22:37,132 --> 02:22:41,797
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

2102
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:46,054
Put it on the speaker.

2103
02:22:56,109 --> 02:22:58,226
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

2104
02:22:59,196 --> 02:23:00,607
Alex, how you doing?

2105
02:23:00,697 --> 02:23:02,108
<i>What happened?</i>

2106
02:23:02,449 --> 02:23:04,782
Oh, we had
some problems.

2107
02:23:07,037 --> 02:23:08,037
Alex?

2108
02:23:08,121 --> 02:23:09,453
<i>Tony, what happened?</i>

2109
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:14,075
We had a little problem.

2110
02:23:14,169 --> 02:23:15,205
<i>I heard.</i>

2111
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:16,456
How you hear that?

2112
02:23:16,546 --> 02:23:18,708
Our friend gave
a speech at the UN.

2113
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:21,758
He was not supposed
to give that speech.

2114
02:23:24,054 --> 02:23:27,388
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

2115
02:23:27,474 --> 02:23:29,716
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen,

2116
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,301
so I canceled
his contract.

2117
02:23:31,394 --> 02:23:33,852
My partners and I
are pissed off.

2118
02:23:34,397 --> 02:23:36,184
That's okay.
No big deal.

2119
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:39,437
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

2120
02:23:39,694 --> 02:23:41,731
No, Tony,
you can't do that.

2121
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:45,273
They found what
was under the car.

2122
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:48,822
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

2123
02:23:49,121 --> 02:23:52,660
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

2124
02:23:53,458 --> 02:23:55,415
There's not
gonna be a next time,

2125
02:23:55,502 --> 02:23:57,334
<i>you dumb cocksucker!
You blew it!</i>

2126
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,207
Take it easy
when you talk to me.

2127
02:23:59,339 --> 02:24:04,175
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

2128
02:24:04,261 --> 02:24:06,218
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to, huh?

2129
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:07,511
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

2130
02:24:07,889 --> 02:24:11,303
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

2131
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:14,890
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

2132
02:24:16,648 --> 02:24:19,061
Alex, you there? Hey!

2133
02:24:19,151 --> 02:24:22,610
He's not there.
<i>Cálmate,</i> man.

2134
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:27,899
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

2135
02:24:28,118 --> 02:24:30,451
One night,
I follow her in a taxi.

2136
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:33,242
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

2137
02:24:34,291 --> 02:24:36,078
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

2138
02:24:36,209 --> 02:24:37,575
You were giving
her the money!

2139
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:39,168
You see what
you do to her?

2140
02:24:39,254 --> 02:24:40,481
I don't give her
that much money.

2141
02:24:40,505 --> 02:24:41,621
You did!

2142
02:24:41,756 --> 02:24:43,543
One time,
$1,000 you gave her.

2143
02:24:43,633 --> 02:24:44,874
Was a guy with her?

2144
02:24:45,594 --> 02:24:47,551
I don't know.

2145
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:50,012
There was this car
in the driveway.

2146
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:51,839
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

2147
02:24:51,933 --> 02:24:52,969
She's like you.

2148
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:54,721
Where's the place?
Where is it?

2149
02:24:54,936 --> 02:24:57,895
400 something...

2150
02:24:57,981 --> 02:24:59,142
Citrus Drive.

2151
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:01,607
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

2152
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:05,066
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

2153
02:25:05,155 --> 02:25:06,987
She says to me,
<i>"Mira,</i> shut up!

2154
02:25:07,115 --> 02:25:08,322
"Mind your own business."

2155
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:10,282
Exactly like
you do to me.

2156
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:13,153
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

2157
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:14,369
I gotta go.

2158
02:25:14,456 --> 02:25:15,947
Why do you have
to hurt everything?

2159
02:25:16,082 --> 02:25:18,074
Why do you have
to destroy

2160
02:25:18,168 --> 02:25:20,455
everything that
comes your way?

2161
02:25:24,507 --> 02:25:25,873
409 Citrus Drive.

2162
02:25:25,967 --> 02:25:27,003
Okay.

2163
02:25:27,302 --> 02:25:29,339
Tony, I can't
find Manny anywhere.

2164
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:30,465
Fuck!

2165
02:25:30,847 --> 02:25:33,635
Okay. Listen, boss,
I'll try again.

2166
02:26:06,675 --> 02:26:09,964
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

2167
02:26:56,224 --> 02:26:57,340
Tony.

2168
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:12,298
We got married
just yesterday.

2169
02:28:12,384 --> 02:28:14,091
We were gonna
surprise you.

2170
02:28:19,808 --> 02:28:21,299
Jesus, Tony.

2171
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:23,972
Tony, we gotta
get outta here, man.

2172
02:28:24,062 --> 02:28:25,269
We gotta
get outta here.

2173
02:28:25,814 --> 02:28:27,476
Go get Gina.

2174
02:28:35,657 --> 02:28:36,818
No!

2175
02:28:43,498 --> 02:28:46,366
No, Gina.
Come on, Gina. No!

2176
02:28:46,501 --> 02:28:48,117
God!

2177
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:58,176
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

2178
02:28:58,304 --> 02:29:00,170
We gotta
get out of here.

2179
02:29:40,054 --> 02:29:41,420
Come on, Gina.

2180
02:29:45,059 --> 02:29:47,267
Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.

2181
02:29:47,395 --> 02:29:49,512
- You got her?
- I got her.

2182
02:30:16,925 --> 02:30:20,794
No! This is Tony's place!
Let me go!

2183
02:31:05,807 --> 02:31:07,298
We put some
pills into her.

2184
02:31:07,392 --> 02:31:08,724
She's gonna be
all right, Tony.

2185
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:10,517
She's cooling down.
Right?

2186
02:31:10,603 --> 02:31:12,390
She's gonna be fine.
Just fine.

2187
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:13,561
Right.

2188
02:31:16,192 --> 02:31:18,024
What are we
gonna do now?

2189
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:23,697
Do?

2190
02:31:28,538 --> 02:31:30,200
We're going to war.

2191
02:31:31,416 --> 02:31:33,578
That's what
we're gonna do.

2192
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:40,214
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

2193
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:45,169
Close that fucker down.

2194
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:53,097
Tony, take it easy.

2195
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,027
All right, Ernie.
Let's go.

2196
02:32:02,113 --> 02:32:04,150
We'll take care
of the house.

2197
02:33:15,186 --> 02:33:17,052
Come on.

2198
02:33:17,146 --> 02:33:19,638
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

2199
02:33:36,416 --> 02:33:39,329
Come on. I'll bury
these cocksuckers.

2200
02:33:48,261 --> 02:33:50,924
We gotta
get organized here.

2201
02:34:02,108 --> 02:34:05,351
Fuck! Manny.

2202
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,152
How the fuck
I do that?

2203
02:34:18,291 --> 02:34:20,704
How the fuck
I do that, Manny?

2204
02:35:32,198 --> 02:35:33,314
Tony.

2205
02:35:42,542 --> 02:35:43,542
Gina.

2206
02:36:00,977 --> 02:36:03,094
Is this what
you want, Tony?

2207
02:36:14,282 --> 02:36:17,195
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

2208
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:21,486
So you want me,
Tony, huh?

2209
02:36:22,373 --> 02:36:23,454
Huh?

2210
02:36:25,251 --> 02:36:26,742
What are you
talking about?

2211
02:36:26,878 --> 02:36:28,289
Ah.

2212
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,836
Is that it?

2213
02:36:33,718 --> 02:36:35,084
Here I am, Tony.

2214
02:36:40,057 --> 02:36:42,265
I am all yours now,
Tony, you see?

2215
02:36:45,062 --> 02:36:46,678
I'm all yours now.

2216
02:36:47,648 --> 02:36:48,648
Gina.

2217
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,642
You better come
and get me now.

2218
02:36:52,570 --> 02:36:54,482
- All right. Come on.
- Come and get me.

2219
02:36:54,572 --> 02:36:56,029
Come and get me.

2220
02:36:57,033 --> 02:36:58,945
You do it now
before it's too late.

2221
02:37:02,496 --> 02:37:03,703
Oh, come on, Tony.

2222
02:37:05,875 --> 02:37:07,036
Fuck me.

2223
02:37:11,088 --> 02:37:13,501
Fuck me. Come on
and just fuck me!

2224
02:37:30,399 --> 02:37:31,435
Die!

2225
02:37:45,581 --> 02:37:48,289
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

2226
02:37:57,802 --> 02:37:58,802
Gina.

2227
02:38:11,691 --> 02:38:15,856
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

2228
02:38:33,421 --> 02:38:35,003
Please talk to me.

2229
02:38:36,841 --> 02:38:38,377
Don't be mad at me.

2230
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:41,968
Please. Gina, come on.

2231
02:38:43,764 --> 02:38:47,428
I love Manny, you know?

2232
02:38:47,768 --> 02:38:49,009
I love him.

2233
02:38:51,063 --> 02:38:53,555
And I love you, too,
you know?

2234
02:39:20,301 --> 02:39:21,587
Give me a smile.

2235
02:39:21,677 --> 02:39:23,043
They're coming
from everywhere!

2236
02:39:23,137 --> 02:39:25,971
Tony, open up!
Open the fucking door!

2237
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,592
Please! Tony!

2238
02:39:29,685 --> 02:39:31,677
Let me in, boss!
Please!

2239
02:39:31,896 --> 02:39:33,933
Tony,
open the fucking door!

2240
02:39:55,836 --> 02:40:00,956
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.
