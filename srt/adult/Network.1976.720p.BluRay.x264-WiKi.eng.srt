1
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,477
This story is about Howard Beale...

2
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,814
...who was the Network News anchorman
on UBS TV.

3
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:25,193
In his time, Howard Beale
had been a mandarin of television.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,489
The grand old man of news, with a HUT
rating of 16 and a 28 audience share.

5
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:34,202
In 1969, however, his fortunes began to decline.

6
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,078
He fell to a 22 share.

7
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:40,041
The following year his wife died,
and he was left a childless widower...

8
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,251
...with an 8 rating and a 12 share.

9
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:45,880
He became morose and isolated,
began to drink heavily.

10
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:49,717
And on September 22, 1975, he was fired...

11
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,594
...effective in two weeks.

12
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:54,347
The news was broken to him by Max Schumacher...

13
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,350
...who was the president
of the news division at UBS.

14
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,144
The two old friends got properly pissed.

15
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:05,191
I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951.

16
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,194
Must've been 1950, then.

17
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:13,366
I was NBC, uh, associate producer, Morning News.

18
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,660
I was just a kid, 26 years old.

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:18,454
Anyway...

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,584
Anyway, they were building the lower level
of the George Washington Bridge.

21
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:26,337
We were doing a remote from there.

22
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:32,343
And nobody told me.

23
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,931
Then after 7 in the morning, I get a call.

24
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,310
"Where the hell are you? You're supposed
to be on the George Washington Bridge."

25
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,982
I jump out of bed,
throw my raincoat over my pajamas.

26
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,069
I run down the stairs,
I run out in the street, hail a cab.

27
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:54,782
And I say to the cabby, "Take me to the
middle of the George Washington Bridge."

28
00:01:57,286 --> 00:02:00,746
And the cabbie turns around and he says...

29
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,500
He says, "Don't do it, buddy.

30
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,711
You're a young man.

31
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,463
You got your whole life ahead of you."

32
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,929
Didn't I ever tell you that one before?

33
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,229
I'm gonna kill myself.

34
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,565
Oh, shit, Howard.

35
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,653
I'm gonna blow my brains out right on the air.

36
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,281
Right in the middle of the 7:00 news.

37
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:40,036
Well, you'll get a hell of a rating,
I'll guarantee you that.

38
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,997
- 50 share easy.
- You think so?

39
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:46,917
Well, sure.
We could make a series out of it.

40
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,170
Suicide of the Week.

41
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,591
Hell. Why limit ourselves?

42
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,009
Execution of the Week.

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,012
Terrorist of the Week.

44
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,431
I love it.

45
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:03,351
Suicides.

46
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,811
Assassinations.

47
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:10,107
Mad bombers, Mafia hit men...

48
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,109
...automobile smashups.

49
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,737
The Death Hour.

50
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:21,327
Great Sunday night show for the whole family.

51
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,456
We'll wipe that fucking Disney
right off the air.

52
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,083
Hmm.

53
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,993
Let's do the Lenin deportation
at the end of three.

54
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,495
That strong enough to bump?

55
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:08,499
In one then, I'll do a lead on Sara Jane
Moore to Mayberry in San Francisco.

56
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,918
In the film I saw,
it was the chief of detectives.

57
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:15,673
I think we've got about 10 seconds
on the shooting itself.

58
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:18,175
The whole thing is 1:25.

59
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:22,179
- What does that come out?
- About 4:50.

60
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:26,225
- We using Squeaky Fromme?
- Let's do that in two.

61
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:30,187
Squeaky, Ford at the airport, bump.

62
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,940
Now, you using a map going into San Francisco?

63
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,901
Um, I prefer our news pics.

64
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,195
What have we got left?

65
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,866
Gun control, Patty Hearst affidavit.

66
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,785
Guerrillas in Chad, OPEC in Vienna.

67
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,477
All right, fine. I'll see you later.

68
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,731
- Hello, Howard, how are you?
- Hi. Okay.

69
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,035
Don't forget, Howard,
Ron Nessen is now 16, okay?

70
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,661
Mm-hm.

71
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,668
The first attempt on President Ford's life
was 18 days ago...

72
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,171
...and again yesterday in San Francisco.

73
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,923
In spite of the two attempts...

74
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,259
...Mr. Ford says he will not become
a prisoner of the Oval Office...

75
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:45,262
...a hostage of would-be assassins.

76
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:49,141
The American people are good people:

77
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:53,270
Democrats, Independents, Republicans and others.

78
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,314
How the hell you always get mixed up...

79
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:58,150
Under no circumstances will I...

80
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,447
...and I hope no others, capitulate...

81
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:07,743
...to those that want to undercut...

82
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,037
...what's all good in America.

83
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,247
Two, cue Howard.

84
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,332
Ladies and gentlemen...

85
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,002
...I would like to announce
that I will be retiring from this program...

86
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,548
...in two weeks' time
because of poor ratings.

87
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:25,177
Since this show was the only thing
I had going for me in my life...

88
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:27,388
...I have decided to kill myself.

89
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:28,931
So, what did she say?

90
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,936
I'm gonna blow my brains out
right on this program, a week from today.

91
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,771
Ten seconds to commercial.

92
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,314
So tune in next Tuesday.

93
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:41,235
That should give the public-relations people
a week to promote the show.

94
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:46,949
We ought to get a hell of a rating
out of that. A 50 share, easy.

95
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,994
- Take Tellison.
- Listen.

96
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,621
- Uh, did you hear that?
- What was that about?

97
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,333
Howard just said he was going
to blow his brains out next Tuesday.

98
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,751
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,504
- Didn't you hear him? He just said--
- What's wrong now?

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,632
Howard just said he was going
to kill himself next Tuesday.

101
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,596
What do you mean, "Howard just said
he was going to kill himself next Tuesday"?

102
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,723
He was supposed to do a tag
on Ron Nessen--

103
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,518
He said, "Tune in next Tuesday.
I'm gonna shoot myself."

104
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,020
What the hell's going on?

105
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,814
He said he was going to blow his brains out.

106
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,858
What the fuck's going on, Howard?

107
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,901
They wanna know what the fuck's going on.

108
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,195
- I can't hear you.
- Turn the studio mike on.

109
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,948
- We're back on in 11 seconds.
- Ten seconds.

110
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,742
Howard, what are you doing?

111
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,202
- Have you flipped?
- I think we better get him off.

112
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,288
- Get him off.
- What's the matter with you?

113
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,833
- Get your fucking hands off.
- Turn the sound off. He's going out live!

114
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,169
We're in a lot of fucking trouble down here.

115
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,047
- This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
- That's my head.

116
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:45,424
Go to standby. You dumb schmuck!

117
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,554
Lou, can't we clear out that downstairs lobby?

118
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,473
- There must be a hundred people.
- How?

119
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:56,393
Every TV station and wire service
in the city. I could barely get in.

120
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:59,188
- Arthur, anything litigable?
- Not so far.

121
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,857
- How many spots were wiped out?
- Frank just walked in.

122
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,609
We had to abort. What could we do?

123
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,986
He's talking to Wheeler.
Over 900 phone calls...

124
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:08,113
- ...complaining about foul language.
- Shit.

125
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,658
Come on, Mickey,
what page are you putting it on?

126
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,410
- Hackett just walked in.
- ABC again, they want the tape.

127
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,205
Tell him to go fuck himself.
That goes for you too.

128
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,956
You're off the air as of now.

129
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,251
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who's replacing Beale tomorrow?

130
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,296
- We're flying Snowden up from Washington.
- Everybody, hold it.

131
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,674
Let's see how the other networks handle this.

132
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,300
Ten o'clock news opened with it.

133
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,011
Good evening.
Howard Beale, one of television's...

134
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,305
They're all gonna make it their lead story.

135
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:36,433
Howard Beale interrupted his
Network News program tonight...

136
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,727
...to announce
that he was gonna kill himself.

137
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:42,898
An unusual thing happened at one
of our sister networks, UBS, this evening.

138
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,775
How are we handling it?

139
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:48,195
Halloway's going to make a brief statement
at the end of the show...

140
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:51,156
...that Howard's been under
great personal stress, et cetera.

141
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:52,741
I'll call you back, John.

142
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,452
All right. We've got
a stockholders' meeting tomorrow...

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,872
...at which we're gonna announce
the restructuring-of-management plan.

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,792
I don't want this grotesque incident
to interfere with that.

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,921
I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short
statement, washing this whole thing off.

146
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,965
You, Max, you better have some answers...

147
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,676
...for those nuts
that come to stockholders' meetings.

148
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:13,512
Mr. Beale has been under
professional and personal strain.

149
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,973
I've got some surprises for you too, Schumacher.

150
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:19,977
I've had it up to here with your cruddy
division and its annual $33 million deficit!

151
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:23,188
You keep your hands off my news division, Frank.

152
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,941
We're responsible to corporate level, not you.

153
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,653
- Well, goddamn, we'll see about that.
- All right, take it easy.

154
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,822
Right now, how do we get Beale out of here?

155
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,826
I understand there's at least a hundred
reporters and camera crews in the lobby.

156
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,828
We got a limo at the freight exit.

157
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,330
Howard, you're gonna spend the night
at my place.

158
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,332
There's bound to be press around yours.

159
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:54,136
I want Snowden here by noon.

160
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,346
Have Lester cover the CIA hearings...

161
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,599
...and give the White House to Doris.

162
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,893
You're late for your screening, Max.

163
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,188
Right. Okay.

164
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,485
If John Wheeler calls,
switch him to Projection Room 7.

165
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,028
Margot, come in here a minute.

166
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,073
- I'm sorry. This Beale business...
- It's all right.

167
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,785
Sit down.
Diana asked if she could sit in on this.

168
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,162
Fine. How's it going?

169
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,707
I think you'll like this footage better
than the stuff I showed you last time, Max.

170
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,378
Max Schumacher.

171
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:32,216
Goddamn it. When, Louise?

172
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:34,134
Laureen?

173
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,719
Well, did he say anything?

174
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,679
Communist Party to be these--

175
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,056
All right, thank you.

176
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,974
--splintered underground groups?

177
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,643
The Communist Party believes...

178
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,063
...that the most pressing
political necessity today...

179
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:49,942
...is the consolidation
of the revolutionary, radical...

180
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,611
...and democratic movements
into a united front.

181
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,740
Harry, Howard Beale left my house
about 20 minutes ago. Has he come in yet?

182
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,784
--of the bourgeois democratic state...

183
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,328
Well, let me know when he arrives, huh?

184
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,747
That's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it?

185
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:06,959
Yeah. This is from
a David Susskind thing a while back.

186
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,919
I think we can use some of this stuff.

187
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,755
--by the broadest possible coalition...

188
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,425
What we're going to see now
is something really sensational.

189
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:19,054
The Flagstaff Independent Bank of Arizona
was ripped off last week...

190
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:22,224
...by a terrorist group called
the Ecumenical Liberation Army.

191
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:25,727
They actually took movies of the rip-off
while they were ripping it off.

192
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:28,438
- Wait till you see it.
- The Ecumenical Liberation Army.

193
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,732
That's not the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?

194
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,068
No, no.
That's the Symbionese Liberation Army.

195
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,487
This is the Ecumenical Liberation Army.

196
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,740
They're the ones who kidnapped
Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.

197
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:42,160
There's a lot of liberation armies
in the revolutionary underground...

198
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:46,081
...and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.
This is Mary Ann Gifford.

199
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:52,462
That's the Great Ahmed Kahn, he's their leader.

200
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,674
You mean, they actually shot this film...

201
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,467
...while they were ripping off the bank?

202
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:02,639
Wait till you see it. I don't know
whether to edit or leave it raw like this.

203
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:07,728
This is terrific stuff.
Where did you get it?

204
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:12,316
I got everything through Laureen Hobbs.
She's my contact for all this stuff.

205
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,699
- Yeah?
- I've got Howard on the other line.

206
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,367
All right, put him on.

207
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,162
Howard, I've got Max on 4.
Would you pick up?

208
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,709
- Listen, Max, I'd like another shot.
- Oh, come on, Howard.

209
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,628
I don't mean the whole show...

210
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:36,465
I'd just like to come on,
make some brief farewell statement...

211
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,635
...and then turn the show over
to Jack Snowden.

212
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,845
I have 11 years at this network, Max.

213
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,722
I have some standing in the industry.

214
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,183
I just don't wanna go out like a clown.

215
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,602
It'll be simple, dignified.

216
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,562
You and Harry can check the copy.

217
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,857
I think it'll take the strain off the show, Max.

218
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,652
Well, what do you think?

219
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,862
Well, okay.

220
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,657
And no booze today, Howard.

221
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,034
No booze.

222
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,873
Summaries have been received.
We're forwarding them...

223
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,584
George, can, uh, you come into my office
for a minute?

224
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,169
Right.

225
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,385
- Barbara, is Tommy around anywhere?
- I think so.

226
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,221
I'd like to see the two of you for a moment.

227
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,523
Uh, this is Bill Herron from our
West Coast Special Programs Department.

228
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,317
George Bosch, Barbara Schlesinger,
Tommy Pellegrino.

229
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:40,779
Look, I just saw some rough footage
of a special Bill's doing...

230
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:43,740
...on the revolutionary underground.
Most is tedious stuff...

231
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:47,411
...of Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets
muttering mutilated Marxism.

232
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,581
But he's got about eight minutes
of a bank robbery...

233
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,793
...that is absolutely sensational.
Authentic stuff.

234
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,921
Actually shot while the robbery was going on.

235
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,340
You remember the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping?

236
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,261
It's that bunch of nuts. She's in the movie
shooting off machine guns.

237
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,932
Really terrific footage. I think we can get
a hell of a Movie of the Week out of it...

238
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,225
...maybe even a series.

239
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,729
A series out of what?
What are we talking about?

240
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,398
Look, we've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals...

241
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,567
...called the Ecumenical
Liberation Army...

242
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:22,154
...who go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.

243
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,073
And maybe they'll take movies
of themselves kidnapping heiresses...

244
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:29,411
...um, hijacking 747s, bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.

245
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:34,416
We'd open each week's segment
with that authentic footage...

246
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,252
...hire writers to write some story
behind that footage...

247
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,588
...and we've got ourselves a series.

248
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:43,175
A series about a bunch
of, uh, bank-robbing guerillas?

249
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,428
What are we gonna call it,
The Mao Tse-Tung Hour?

250
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,889
- Ha, ha!
- Why not?

251
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:52,684
They've got Strike Force, Task Force,
SWAT, why not Che Guevara...

252
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,519
...and his own little mod squad?

253
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,355
Look, I sent you all
a concept-analysis report yesterday.

254
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,357
Did any of you read it?

255
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,072
Well, in a nutshell, it said
the American people are turning sullen.

256
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:09,159
They've been clobbered by Vietnam,
Watergate, inflation, the Depression.

257
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:12,913
They've turned off, shot up and fucked
themselves limp. And nothing helps.

258
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:17,793
So this concept-analysis report concludes
the American people want somebody...

259
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,796
...to articulate their rage for them.

260
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:24,091
I've been telling you people
since I took this job six months ago...

261
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,343
...that I want angry shows.

262
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:30,097
I don't want conventional programming
on this network, I want counterculture.

263
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,265
I want antiestablishment.

264
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,271
I don't wanna play butch boss with you people.

265
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,232
When I took over this department...

266
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,193
...it had the worst programming record
in television history.

267
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,654
This network hasn't one show in the top 20.

268
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,156
This network is an industry joke.

269
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,368
And we better start putting together
one winner for next September.

270
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:57,082
I want a show developed based
on the activities of a terrorist group.

271
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,543
Joseph Stalin and his merry band of Bolsheviks.

272
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,130
I want ideas from you people.
That is what you're paid for.

273
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:07,050
And, by the way, the next time I send
an audience research report around...

274
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:11,054
...you'd all better read it, or I'll sack
the fucking lot of you, is that clear?

275
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:13,390
I'll be out on the coast in, uh, four weeks.

276
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,642
Will you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?

277
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,852
Sure.

278
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,480
But the business of management is management.

279
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,358
And at the time CCA took control
of the UBS TV Network...

280
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:27,487
...it was foundering with less than
7 percent of national television revenues...

281
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,240
...most network programs being sold
at station rates.

282
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,618
I am pleased to announce I am
submitting to the board of directors...

283
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:36,872
...a plan for the coordination
of the main profit centers.

284
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,623
And with the specific intention...

285
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,961
...of making each division
more responsive to management.

286
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,297
Point one.

287
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,926
The division producing the lowest rate
of return has been the news division...

288
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:55,724
...with its $98 million budget and
its average annual deficit of 32 million.

289
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,436
I know that, historically, news divisions
are expected to lose money.

290
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:03,023
But to our minds, this philosophy
is a wanton fiscal affront...

291
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,817
...to be resolutely resisted.

292
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:10,947
The new plan calls for local news to be
transferred to owned stations' divisions.

293
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:15,327
News radio would be transferred
to the UBS Radio Division and in effect...

294
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,706
...the news division would be reduced
from an independent division...

295
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:23,835
...to a department accountable
to network.

296
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,260
- What was that all about, Ed?
- This is not the time, Max.

297
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,429
Why wasn't I told about this?

298
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:37,349
Why was I led up onto that podium
and publicly humiliated...

299
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,142
...in front of the stockholders?

300
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,645
Goddamn it,
I spoke to John Wheeler this morning...

301
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,980
...and he assured me
the news division was safe.

302
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,316
That's one hell of a way to get me to resign.

303
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:50,237
We'll talk about this tomorrow
at our regular morning meeting.

304
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,874
- Eleven, 10...
- Roll VTA.

305
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,461
...nine, eight, seven, six.

306
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:10,507
In five, four, three, two...

307
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,134
- One.
- One, cue VTA.

308
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:18,848
Cue announcer.

309
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:24,020
The UBS evening news with Howard Beale.

310
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,772
Ready, two?

311
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,691
Two, cue Howard.

312
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,820
Good evening. Today is Wednesday,
September the 24th...

313
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,863
...and this is my last broadcast.

314
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:40,245
Yesterday I announced on this program
that I was going to commit public suicide.

315
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:44,582
Admittedly an act of madness.
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

316
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,084
I just ran out of bullshit.

317
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,004
- All right, cut him off.
- Leave him on.

318
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:51,298
Am I still on the air?

319
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,675
If this is how he wants to go out,
this is how he goes out.

320
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,553
--except I just ran out of bullshit.

321
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,638
Mr. Schumacher's right here.
Wanna talk to him?

322
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,182
Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living.

323
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,561
If we can't think up any reasons
of our own, we have the God bullshit.

324
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,022
- Holy Mary, Mother of Christ.
- Tom, what is it?

325
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,191
--through all this pointless pain,
humiliation and decay...

326
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,444
...so there better be someone
who does know.

327
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,195
That's the God bullshit.

328
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,866
He's saying that life is bullshit and it is.
What are you screaming about?

329
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,493
Man is a noble creature that can order
his own world. Who needs God?

330
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,455
If there's anybody out there...

331
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,750
...that can look around this
slaughterhouse of a world we live in...

332
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,252
...and tell me that man
is a noble creature...

333
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,755
...believe me, that man is full of bullshit.

334
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:36,468
- What's so goddamn funny?
- I can't help it, Harry. It's funny.

335
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,139
Max, this is going out live to 67 affiliates.

336
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,682
Leave him on.

337
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:47,270
And I was married for 33 years
of shrill, shrieking fraud.

338
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:51,441
- Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you.
- Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.

339
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,277
So I don't have any bullshit left.

340
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,614
I just ran out of it, you see.

341
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:06,289
Mr. Ruddy, could we have
just one statement from you?

342
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,292
Sorry, I don't have all the information yet.

343
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,169
One question.

344
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,383
Could we--? If we could just
have one statement about Mr. Beale.

345
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,560
Max.

346
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,071
I'll want to see Mr. Beale after this.

347
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:43,410
The way I hear it, Max,
you were primarily responsible...

348
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,620
...for this colossally stupid prank.

349
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,665
- Is that the fact, Max?
- That's the fact.

350
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,292
It was unconscionable.

351
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,589
There doesn't seem to be anything more to say.

352
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,091
I have something to say, Ed.

353
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,178
I want to know why that whole debasement
of the news division...

354
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:06,766
...announced at the stockholders' meeting
this afternoon was kept secret from me.

355
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,394
You and I go back 20 years, Ed.

356
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,021
I took this job with your personal assurance...

357
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,817
...that you'd back my autonomy
against any encroachment.

358
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:20,697
But ever since CCA acquired control
of UBS Systems 10 months ago...

359
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,991
...Hackett's been taking over everything.

360
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,287
Now who the hell is running this network?
You or some conglomerate called CCA?

361
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,165
I mean you're president of the Systems Group...

362
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,376
...and Hackett's nothing
but a hatchet man for CCA.

363
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,546
Nelson here, president of a network...

364
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:39,382
...and he hasn't a thing
to say about anything anymore.

365
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,010
I told you at the stockholders' meeting, Max...

366
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:46,055
...that we would discuss all that
at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.

367
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,390
If you had been patient...

368
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,643
...I would've explained that
I thought Frank Hackett precipitate...

369
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,062
...and that the reorganization
of the division...

370
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,566
...would not be executed until everyone,
specifically you, Max...

371
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,569
...had been consulted and satisfied.

372
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,531
Instead, you sulked off like a child
and engaged this network...

373
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,575
...in a shocking and disgraceful episode.

374
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,827
Your position is no longer tenable...

375
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,872
...regardless of how management
is restructured.

376
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,709
I will expect your resignation
at 10:00 tomorrow morning...

377
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,546
...and we will coordinate our statements
to the least detriment of everyone.

378
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:21,466
Bob McDonough will take over
the news division...

379
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,593
...until we can sort all this out.

380
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,223
I'd like to see Mr. Beale now.

381
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,018
They're looking for him, Ed.
They don't know where he is.

382
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:38,441
Every day, five days a week for 15 years,
I've been sitting behind that desk.

383
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,109
The dispassionate pundit...

384
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:44,072
...reporting with seemly detachment
the daily parade...

385
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,783
...of lunacies that constitute the news.

386
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,286
And just once I wanted to say
what I really felt.

387
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,330
Knock it off, Arthur.

388
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,082
It was, after all, my last...

389
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:13,851
- Did the overnight ratings come in yet?
- They're on your desk.

390
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,979
Have you still got yesterday's overnights?

391
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,064
- Shall I bring them in?
- Yeah.

392
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,490
These are those four outlines submitted
by Universal for an hour series.

393
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,201
You needn't bother to read them.
I'll tell them to you.

394
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:34,831
The first one is set in a large
Eastern law school, presumably Harvard.

395
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,834
The series is irresistibly entitled
The New Lawyers.

396
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:41,421
The running characters are a crusty
but benign ex-Supreme Court Justice...

397
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,882
...presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes
by way of Dr. Zorba.

398
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,135
There is a beautiful girl graduate student...

399
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:50,680
...and the district attorney who
is brilliant and sometimes cuts corners.

400
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,181
Next one.

401
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,434
The second one is called The Amazon Squad.

402
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:55,852
Lady cops?

403
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,938
The running characters include
a crusty but benign lieutenant...

404
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,524
...who's always getting heat
from the commissioner...

405
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,944
...a hard-drinking detective
who thinks women belong in the kitchen...

406
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,363
...and a brilliant and beautiful
young girl cop...

407
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:11,034
- ...who's fighting the feminist battle.
- We're up to our ears in lady cops.

408
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,245
The next is another one
of those investigative reporter shows.

409
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,831
A crusty but benign managing editor
who's always--

410
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,666
You know, Barbara...

411
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:24,047
...the Arabs have decided to jack up
the price of oil another 20 percent.

412
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,967
Uh, the CIA has been caught opening
Senator Humphrey's mail.

413
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:33,056
There's a civil war in Angola,
another one in Beirut.

414
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,225
The-- New York City's still facing default.

415
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,020
They finally caught up with Patricia Hearst.

416
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:43,066
And the whole front page
of the Daily News is Howard Beale.

417
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,862
There's also a two-column story
on Page 1 of the Times.

418
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,451
Helen, call Mr. Hackett's office.

419
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,329
See if he can give me
a few minutes this morning.

420
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:06,464
KTNS, Kansas City, refuses to carry
our Network News show anymore...

421
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,383
...unless Beale is taken off the air.

422
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,760
Did you see the overnights on the Network News?

423
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:15,556
It has an eight in New York, a nine in L.A.
and a 27 share in both cities.

424
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,435
Last night Howard Beale went on the air
and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes...

425
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:23,564
...and I can tell you right now that tonight's
show will get a 30 share, at least.

426
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,441
I think we've lucked into something.

427
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,486
For God's sakes. Are you suggesting
that we put that lunatic...

428
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,446
...back on the air yelling "bullshit"?

429
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:33,783
I think we should put Beale back
on the air tonight and keep him on.

430
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,619
Did you see the news this morning?
Did you see the Times?

431
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:40,331
We've got press on this you couldn't buy
for a million dollars. Frank.

432
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:43,793
That dumb show jumped
five rating points in one night.

433
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,837
Tonight's show has gotta be at least 15.

434
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:49,841
We just increased our audience
by 20 or 30 million people in one night.

435
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,135
You're not gonna get this dumped in your lap...

436
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,762
...for the rest of your days.
You can't piss it away.

437
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,056
Howard Beale said what every American feels...

438
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:02,145
...that he's tired of all the bullshit.
He's articulating the popular rage.

439
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:06,482
I want that show, Frank. I can turn that
show into the biggest smash on television.

440
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,610
What do you mean? It's a news show.
It's not your department.

441
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,363
I see Howard Beale
as a latter-day prophet.

442
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:16,492
A magnificent, messianic figure inveighing
against the hypocrisies of our times.

443
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,120
A strip Savonarola, Monday through Friday...

444
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,290
...that I tell you, Frank,
could just go through the roof...

445
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,501
...and I'm talking about a $6 cost
per thousand show.

446
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,504
I'm talking about a hundred--
A 130,000-dollar minutes.

447
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,215
Do you wanna figure out
the revenues of a strip show...

448
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,301
...that sells for 100,000 bucks a minute?

449
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:36,304
One show like that could pull
this network out of the hole.

450
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:39,015
Frank, it's being handed to us on a plate.
Let's not blow it.

451
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,518
Yes?

452
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,521
Tell him I'll be a few minutes.

453
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:48,900
Let me think it over.

454
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,861
Frank, let's not go to committee on this.
It's 20 after 10.

455
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,947
We want Beale in that studio.
We don't wanna lose the momentum.

456
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,324
For God's sake, Diana...

457
00:26:56,492 --> 00:27:01,913
...we're talking about putting a manifestly
irresponsible man on national television.

458
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:14,425
I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs at least
and Herb Thackeray...

459
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:17,470
...and certainly Joe Donnelly
in Standards and Practices.

460
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,891
And you know, I'm going to be eyeball
to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this.

461
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,520
If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy,
I wanna make sure of some of my ground.

462
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,189
I'm the one whose ass is going on the line.

463
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,652
I'll get back to you, Diana.

464
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,075
I don't believe this.
I don't believe the top brass...

465
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:42,411
...of a national television network
are sitting around their salads--

466
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,331
The top brass of a bankrupt
national television network...

467
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,750
...with projected losses
of close to $150 million.

468
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,168
I don't care how bankrupt.

469
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:54,549
You can't be seriously proposing,
and the rest of us seriously considering...

470
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,593
...putting on a pornographic
Network News show.

471
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,512
- The FCC'd kill us.
- Sit down, Nelson.

472
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,431
The FCC can't do anything
except rap our knuckles.

473
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,685
I don't even wanna think about
the litigious possibilities, Frank.

474
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,105
- Could be up to our ears in lawsuits.
- The affiliates won't carry it.

475
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,191
Affiliates will kiss your ass,
if you can hand them a hit show.

476
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,401
The popular reaction--

477
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,612
We don't know the popular reaction.
We have to find out.

478
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,822
The New York Times--

479
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,325
The New York Times
doesn't advertise on our network.

480
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,582
All I know is this violates every canon
of respectable broadcasting.

481
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,877
We're not a respectable network.
We're a whorehouse network.

482
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,296
We have to take whatever we can get.

483
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,299
Well, I don't want any part of it.

484
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,051
I don't fancy myself
the president of a whorehouse.

485
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,929
That's very commendable of you, Nelson.
Now, sit down.

486
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:47,476
Your indignation has been duly recorded.
You can always resign tomorrow.

487
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,815
Now look, what in substance are we proposing?

488
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:57,153
Merely to add editorial comment
to our Network News show.

489
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,990
Brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner,
all have their comments.

490
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:03,117
Now Howard Beale will have his.

491
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,829
I think we ought to give it a shot.
Let's see what happens tonight.

492
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,039
Telephone, please.

493
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,125
I don't wanna be the messenger
that has to tell Max Schumacher.

494
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,210
Max doesn't work at this network anymore.

495
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,879
Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.

496
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,757
Bob McDonough's running the news division now.

497
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,177
Bob McDonough in News, please.

498
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,680
Oh, I don't know.

499
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,266
I may teach or I may write a book...

500
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,852
...whatever the hell one does
when one approaches...

501
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,396
...the autumn of one's years.

502
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,651
My God, is that me?

503
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,028
- Was I ever that young?
- Ha, ha.

504
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,114
No. Howard just brought
in a picture of Ed Murrow...

505
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,617
...and the whole CBS gang
when we were there.

506
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:46,118
You wouldn't believe it.

507
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:50,498
Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner,
Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.

508
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,583
- Is that you, Howard?
- Mm-hm.

509
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,211
Yeah.

510
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,381
- Okay, Dick, we'll be in touch. Right.
- You remember this kid?

511
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,884
He's the kid I think you once sent out to
interview Cleveland Amory on vivisection.

512
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:07,556
What's so funny?

513
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,980
So I jump out of bed in my pajamas,
I grab my raincoat, I run downstairs.

514
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,565
I run out in the street and I hail a cab.

515
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,734
And I jumped in and I yell at the driver:

516
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,821
"Take me to the middle
of the George Washington Bridge."

517
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:27,618
And the driver turns around and he says:
"Don't do it, buddy, don't do it.

518
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,204
You're young,
you got your whole life ahead of you."

519
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,332
Ha-ha-ha!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

520
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,167
If you think that's funny--

521
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,878
No, if you think that's funny,
wait till you hear this.

522
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,297
I've just come back from Frank Hackett's office.

523
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,216
He wants to put Howard on the air.

524
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:43,801
- You're kidding.
- Apparently...

525
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,178
...the ratings went up
five points last night...

526
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,473
...and he wants Howard to go back on
and do his angry-man thing.

527
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,642
What are you talking about?

528
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,770
I'm telling you. They want Howard
to go back on and yell "bullshit."

529
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:01,360
They want Howard to go on spontaneously
letting out his anger.

530
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,405
A latter-day prophet denouncing
the hypocrisies of our times.

531
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,699
Hey, that sounds pretty good.

532
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,035
Who's this "they"?

533
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:13,247
Hackett. Chaney was there.
The Legal Affairs guy.

534
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,332
Oh, and that girl from Programming.

535
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,501
Christensen?
What's she got to do with this?

536
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,171
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- I'm not kidding.

537
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,380
I told them. I said:

538
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,133
"Look, we're running a news department,
not a circus.

539
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,635
And Howard Beale's not a bearded lady.

540
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,472
If you think I'm gonna go along
with this bastardization...

541
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,850
...you can have my resignation along
with Max Schumacher's right now.

542
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,811
I think I'm speaking for Howard Beale
and everybody else--"

543
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,023
That's my job you're turning down.

544
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,776
I'd go nuts without some kind of work.

545
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:46,238
What's wrong with being an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

546
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,199
What do you think, Max?

547
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,952
Do you want to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

548
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,540
Yeah, I think I'd like to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

549
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,794
Then grab it. Grab it!

550
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,177
- Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.
- Good afternoon.

551
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,304
Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.

552
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,268
- He's waiting for you, Mr. Ruddy.
- Thank you.

553
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:26,362
Nelson Chaney tells me Beale
may actually go on the air this evening.

554
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,490
As far as I know, Howard's going to do it.

555
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,869
You going to sit still for this, Ed?

556
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:37,498
Yes.
I think Hackett's overstepped himself.

557
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,292
There's some kind of corporate
maneuvering going on, Max.

558
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,670
Hackett is clearly forcing a confrontation.

559
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:46,048
That would account for his behavior
at the stockholders' meeting.

560
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:49,802
However, I think he's making a serious
mistake with this Beale business.

561
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:55,099
I suspect CCA will be upset
at Hackett's presumptuousness.

562
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,351
Certainly Mr. Jensen will.

563
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,563
So I'm going to let Hackett
have his head for a while.

564
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,649
He just might lose it over this Beale business.

565
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,656
I'd like you to reconsider
your resignation, Max.

566
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,450
I assume that Hackett
wouldn't take such steps...

567
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,619
...without some support
on the CCA board.

568
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:18,581
I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.

569
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:21,750
When that happens,
I'm going to need every friend I've got.

570
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:25,588
And I certainly don't want Hackett's
people in all of the divisional positions.

571
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,882
So I'd like you to stay on, Max.

572
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,846
Of course, Ed.

573
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,433
Thank you, Max.

574
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:42,771
This has been the UBS
evening news with Howard Beale.

575
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,027
The initial response to the new
Howard Beale Show was not auspicatory.

576
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:52,448
The press was without exception hostile
and the industry reaction negative.

577
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,618
The ratings for the Thursday
and Friday shows were both 14.

578
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,745
But Monday's rating dropped a point...

579
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:01,332
...clearly suggesting
the novelty was wearing off.

580
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,002
Did you know there are a number of psychics...

581
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,796
...working as licensed brokers
on Wall Street?

582
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,633
Some of them counsel their clients
by use of tarot cards.

583
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,178
They're all pretty successful,
even in a bear market and selling short.

584
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:17,765
I met one of them last week
and thought of doing a show around her.

585
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,601
The Wayward Witch of Wall Street,
something like that.

586
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:23,270
If her tips were any good,
she could wreck the market.

587
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:28,817
So I called her this morning and asked her
how she was on predicting the future.

588
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,528
She said she was occasionally prescient.

589
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,572
For example, she said:

590
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,325
"I just had a fleeting vision of you...

591
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,370
...sitting in an office
with a craggy middle-aged man...

592
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:43,082
...with whom you are,
or will be, emotionally involved."

593
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,500
And here I am.

594
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,837
And she does all this with tarot cards?

595
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,466
No. This one operates on parapsychology.

596
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:56,845
She has trance-like episodes
and feels things in her energy field.

597
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,474
I think this lady could
be very useful to you, Max.

598
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,518
- In what way?
- Well...

599
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,854
...you put on a news show
and here's somebody who can predict...

600
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,606
...tomorrow's news for you.

601
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,401
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

602
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:11,902
Sibyl the Soothsayer.

603
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,656
You could give her two minutes of trance
at the end of a Howard Beale Show...

604
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,199
...say, once a week, Friday...

605
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,452
...which is suggestively occult,
and she could oraculate.

606
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,665
Then next week everyone tunes in to see
how good her predictions were.

607
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,084
Maybe she could do the weather.

608
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:32,423
Your Network News is going to need
some help, Max, if it's gonna hold.

609
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,883
Beale doesn't do
the angry-man thing well at all.

610
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:38,721
He's too, uh, kvetchy. He's being irascible.
We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon.

611
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,514
He should do more apocalyptic doom.

612
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,060
I think you should take on a couple of
writers to write some jeremiads for him.

613
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,563
I see you don't fancy my suggestions.

614
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,817
Hell, you're not serious, are you?

615
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,528
Oh, I'm serious.

616
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,366
The fact is I could make your Beale Show
the highest-rated news show...

617
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:02,870
...in television,
if you'd let me have a crack at it.

618
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:08,250
- What do you mean, "have a crack at it"?
- I'd like to program it for you. Develop it.

619
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:13,297
I wouldn't interfere with the actual news
itself, but TV is showbiz, Max.

620
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,092
And even the news
has to have a little showmanship.

621
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,636
My God, you are serious.

622
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,599
Oh. I watched your 6:00 news today.
It's straight tabloid.

623
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:27,311
You had a minute and a half of that lady
riding a bike naked in Central Park.

624
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,647
You had less than a minute of hard national
and international news.

625
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,400
It was all sex, scandal,
brutal crimes, sports...

626
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,612
...children with incurable diseases
and lost puppies.

627
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,532
I don't think I'll listen to any protestations
of high standards of journalism...

628
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,285
...when you're soliciting audiences
like the rest of us.

629
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,955
All I'm saying is, if you're gonna hustle,
at least do it right.

630
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,291
I'm gonna bring this up at tomorrow's meeting.

631
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,836
I don't like network hassles. I was hoping
you and I could work this out.

632
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,671
Now that's why I'm here.

633
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,926
And I was hoping that you were looking
for an emotional involvement...

634
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,095
...with a craggy middle-aged man.

635
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,681
Oh, I wouldn't rule that out entirely.

636
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,187
All right, Diana.

637
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,856
You bring up all your ideas
at the meeting tomorrow...

638
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,983
...because if you don't, I will.

639
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,320
I think Howard's making
a goddamn fool of himself...

640
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:22,157
...and so does everybody
that Howard and I know in this industry.

641
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,661
It was a fluke. It didn't work.

642
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:29,915
So tomorrow,
Howard goes back to the old format...

643
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,127
...and all of this gutter depravity
comes to an end.

644
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,464
Okay.

645
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,057
I don't get it, Diana.

646
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:51,520
You hung around until 7:30
and then came all the way down here...

647
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,189
...just to pitch a couple
of loony showbiz ideas...

648
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:57,943
...when you knew goddamn well
I'd laugh you right out of the office.

649
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,987
I don't get it.

650
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,656
What's your scam in this?

651
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,367
Max, my little visit here tonight...

652
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:09,788
...was a gesture made out of your stature
in the industry...

653
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,876
...and because I personally admired you
since I was a kid majoring in speech...

654
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,586
...at the University of Missouri.

655
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:18,672
Sooner or later, with or without you...

656
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,175
...I'm going to take over
your Network News show...

657
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,594
...and I figured
I might as well start tonight.

658
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,889
I, uh, think I once gave a lecture...

659
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,476
...at the University of Missouri.

660
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,894
I was in the audience.

661
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,106
I had a terrible schoolgirl crush
on you for a couple of months.

662
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:39,443
If we could get back for a moment
to that gypsy...

663
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:45,282
...who predicted all that about, uh, emotional
involvements and middle-aged men.

664
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,076
What are you doing for dinner tonight?

665
00:38:57,629 --> 00:39:00,589
I can't make it tonight, love.
Call me tomorrow.

666
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,178
- Do you have a favorite restaurant?
- I eat anything.

667
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,348
Son of a bitch, I get a feeling I'm being made.

668
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,058
You are.

669
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:15,229
Ah, I've got to warn you,
I don't do anything on my first date.

670
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,105
We'll see.

671
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:25,280
Schmuck, what are you getting into?

672
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:50,597
I was married for four years
and pretended to be happy...

673
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:54,101
...and had six years of analysis
and pretended to be sane.

674
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,688
My husband ran off with his boyfriend...

675
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,731
...and I had an affair with my analyst.

676
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,110
He told me I was the worst lay he'd ever had.

677
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,406
I can't tell you how many men
have told me what a lousy lay I am.

678
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,908
I apparently have a masculine temperament.

679
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:13,829
I arouse quickly, consummate prematurely...

680
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:17,666
...and can't wait to get my clothes back on
and get out of that bedroom.

681
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:22,879
I seem to be inept at everything except my work.

682
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:27,843
I'm good at my work.
So I confine myself to that.

683
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:31,471
All I want out of life
is a 30 share and a 20 rating.

684
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,142
You're married, surely?

685
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,645
Twenty-five years.

686
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,524
I have a married daughter in Seattle
who's six months pregnant...

687
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:48,488
...a younger girl who's starting
at Northwestern in January.

688
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,743
Well, Max, here we are.

689
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:57,372
Middle-aged man reaffirming
his middle-aged manhood...

690
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,584
...and a terrified young woman
with a father complex.

691
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,712
What sort of script do you think
we can make out of this?

692
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:09,468
Corridor gossip, uh, says that you are
Frank Hackett's backstage girl.

693
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,679
Ha, ha. I'm not.

694
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:16,975
Frank is a corporation man, body and soul.

695
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:20,687
He has no loves, lusts or allegiances
that are not consummately directed...

696
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,606
...toward becoming a CCA board member.

697
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:26,318
So why should he bother with me?
I'm not even a stockholder.

698
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:31,573
What about your loves, lusts and allegiances?

699
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,784
Is your wife in town?

700
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,078
Yes.

701
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:39,081
Well, then, we better go to my place.

702
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,418
I can't hear you.
You will have to talk a little louder.

703
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,054
Yes. I hear you.

704
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:02,479
Yes.

705
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,529
Why me?

706
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:14,032
I said, "Why me?"

707
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,708
Okay.

708
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,263
Howard in his office?

709
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:42,394
Oh, Harry, I'm killing this whole
screwball, angry-prophet thing.

710
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:46,398
- Tonight we go back to straight news.
- Okay.

711
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:51,486
Fifteen seconds, 14, 13...

712
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,071
Yeah? What?

713
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,950
Max, I'm telling you, he's fine.
He's been sharp all day.

714
00:42:57,118 --> 00:43:00,746
He's been funny as hell. Had everybody
cracking up at the rundown meeting.

715
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,748
I told him. I told him.

716
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,292
Up. Cue VTA.

717
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:07,836
Ready, two.

718
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:10,672
Cue announcer.

719
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,842
The UBS Evening News with Howard Beale.

720
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,677
Take 2, cue Howard.

721
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:19,806
Last night, I was awakened
from a fitful sleep...

722
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:22,517
...shortly after 2:00 in the morning...

723
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,645
...by a shrill, sibilant, faceless voice.

724
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:29,357
I couldn't make it out at first
in the dark bedroom...

725
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:34,029
...and I said, "I'm sorry,
you will have to talk a little louder."

726
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:37,282
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

727
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,660
And the voice said to me,
"I want you to tell the people the truth.

728
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:43,705
Not an easy thing to do because
the people don't want to know."

729
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:46,333
And I said, "You're kidding.

730
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,919
What the hell should I know
about the truth?"

731
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:53,423
But the voice said to me,
"Don't worry about the truth.

732
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,884
I will put the words in your mouth."

733
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:59,387
I said, "What's this, the Burning Bush?
For God's sake, I'm not Moses."

734
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,891
The voice said to me, "And I'm not God.
What has that got to do with it?"

735
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,142
The voice said to me:

736
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,354
"We're not talking about eternal
or absolute or ultimate truth.

737
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,565
We're talking about impermanent,
transient, human truth.

738
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:13,068
I don't expect you people
to be capable of truth...

739
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:15,737
...but at least you're capable of
self-preservation."

740
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:20,116
And I said, "Why me?"

741
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:23,370
And the voice said,
"Because you're on television, dummy.

742
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:24,621
Beautiful.

743
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,040
You have 40 million Americans listening to you.

744
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,875
After this show, you could have 50.

745
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:33,421
I'm not asking you to walk the land
in sackcloth, preaching the Armageddon.

746
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,340
You're on TV, man."

747
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,676
So I thought about it for a moment...

748
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:42,472
...and then I said, "Okay."

749
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:04,286
Close the door, Harry.

750
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,542
Howard, I'm taking you off the air.

751
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:15,005
I think you're having a breakdown.
Require treatment.

752
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,302
This is not a psychotic episode.

753
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:23,388
This is a cleansing moment of clarity.

754
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:29,811
I'm imbued, Max.

755
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:34,691
I'm imbued with some special spirit.
It's not a religious feeling at all.

756
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:38,153
It's a shocking eruption
of great electrical energy.

757
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:41,489
I feel vivid and flashing, as if suddenly...

758
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:46,578
...I'd been plugged into some
great electromagnetic field.

759
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,498
I feel connected to all living things.

760
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,417
To flowers...

761
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:56,963
...birds, all the animals of the world...

762
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:04,387
...and even to some great
unseen living force.

763
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:07,599
What I think the Hindus call prana.

764
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:10,518
It is not a breakdown.

765
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:13,313
I've never felt more orderly in my life.

766
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:18,109
It is a shattering and beautiful sensation.

767
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:22,322
It is the exalted flow
of the space-time continuum...

768
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,409
...save that it is spaceless
and timeless and...

769
00:46:27,036 --> 00:46:29,287
...of such loveliness.

770
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:35,919
I feel on the verge
of some great ultimate truth.

771
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:46,638
And you will not take me off the air
for now, or for any other spaceless time.

772
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,643
Oh, boy.

773
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,480
- Is he okay?
- He's just fainted.

774
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:58,650
I'd better get him back
to my house again tonight.

775
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,819
Help me get him up.

776
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,383
Everyone's going crazy.

777
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,553
The whole place has gone crazy.

778
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:29,764
Sitting in their house
and they don't do anything about it.

779
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:52,097
Wake up, Max, because Howard's gone.

780
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:54,724
I'll make you some coffee.

781
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,310
You don't know where he is?

782
00:48:57,478 --> 00:49:00,605
The son of a bitch is a hit, goddamn it!
Over 2000 phone calls.

783
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:03,858
Go down to the mail room.
As of this minute, over 14,000 telegrams!

784
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:07,612
The response is sensational! Tell him.
Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.

785
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,864
Every goddamned affiliate
from Albuquerque to Sandusky.

786
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,909
The response is sensational!

787
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:17,455
Yes. All right. For you, Herb.
Get back to your office.

788
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:19,624
Moldanian called me.
Joe Donnelly called me.

789
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:22,627
We got a goddamn hit, goddamn it.
Diana, show him the Times.

790
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:25,421
We got an editorial
in the holy goddamn New York Times.

791
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,882
- "A call to morality."
- I don't know where he is.

792
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,884
That son of a bitch Beale has caught on.

793
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:33,513
- Don't tell me you don't know.
- Could be jumping off a roof for all I know.

794
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:37,016
The man is insane.
He's not responsible for himself.

795
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,893
He needs care and treatment.

796
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:42,564
And all you grave robbers
think about is that he's a hit.

797
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:45,900
You know, Max,
it's just possible that he isn't insane.

798
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,778
That he is, in fact, imbued
with some special spirit.

799
00:49:48,946 --> 00:49:50,905
My God, I'm supposed to be the romantic...

800
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:52,866
...you're the hard-bitten realist.

801
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,785
All right.
Howard Beale obviously fills a void.

802
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:59,122
The audience out there wants a prophet,
even a manufactured one...

803
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,915
...even if he's as mad as Moses.

804
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,668
By tomorrow he'll have a 50 share,
maybe even a 60.

805
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:05,795
Howard Beale is processed, instant God.

806
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:08,756
It looks like he may just go bigger
than Mary Tyler Moore.

807
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,426
I am not putting Howard back on the air.

808
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:14,387
It's not your show anymore, Max, it's mine.

809
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,099
I gave her the show, Schumacher.

810
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:21,436
I'm putting the Network News show
under programming.

811
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,522
Mr. Ruddy has had a mild heart attack
and is not taking calls.

812
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,567
In his absence,
I'm making all network decisions...

813
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:30,278
...including one I've been wanting
to make a long time.

814
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:33,781
You're fired.
I want you out of this building by noon.

815
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:37,785
I'll call the security guards and have you
thrown out, if you're still here.

816
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,624
Well, let's say, "Fuck you, Hackett."

817
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,377
You want me out, you're gonna have to
drag me out kicking and screaming...

818
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,713
...and the whole division
kicking with me!

819
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:51,466
Gonna quit their jobs for you?
Not in this recession.

820
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:53,468
When Ruddy gets back he'll have your ass.

821
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:56,971
I got a hit, Schumacher,
and Ruddy doesn't count anymore.

822
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:00,308
He was hoping I'd fall on my face
with this Beale Show, but I didn't.

823
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:04,979
It's a big, fat, big-titted hit and I don't have
to waffle around with Ruddy anymore.

824
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:07,899
If he wants to take me up
before the CCA Board, let him.

825
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:10,818
Think Ruddy is stupid enough
to go to the CCA Board and say:

826
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:12,987
"I'm taking our one hit show off the air"?

827
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,865
And comes November 14,
I'm going to be standing up there...

828
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,992
...at the annual CCA
management meeting.

829
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,787
I'm gonna announce projected earnings
for this network...

830
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:22,664
...for the first time in five years.

831
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:26,709
And believe me, Mr. Jensen's going
to be sitting there rocking back and forth...

832
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:31,214
...in his little chair and he's going to say:
"That's very good, Frank, keep it up."

833
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:34,968
Don't have any illusions about who's
running this network. You're fired!

834
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:38,638
I want you out of your office before noon
or I'll have you thrown out.

835
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:45,228
You go along with this?

836
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,648
Max, I told you I didn't want
a network hassle on this.

837
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:52,819
I told you I'd much rather work the
Beale Show out just between the two of us.

838
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:56,239
Well, let's just say,
"Fuck you too, honey."

839
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:00,118
Howard Beale may be my best friend.
I'll go to court.

840
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:03,621
I'll put him in a hospital before I'll let you
exploit him like a freak.

841
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,999
You get your psychiatrists, I'll get mine.

842
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,210
I'm gonna spread this whole
reeking business in every newspaper...

843
00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:12,046
...on every network, group
and affiliate in this country.

844
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:16,884
- I'm gonna make a lot of noise about this.
- Great. We need all the press we can get.

845
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:22,265
Something going on between you and Schumacher?

846
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:24,726
Not anymore.

847
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:45,580
- How do you do, Mr. Beale?
- I must make my witness.

848
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:47,623
Sure thing, Mr. Beale.

849
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:54,422
Oil ministers of the OPEC nations meeting
in Vienna still haven't decided...

850
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,382
...how much more to increase
the price of oil.

851
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:59,093
- Ready, VTA?
- Yeah. Okay.

852
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,721
He came in the building about five minutes ago.

853
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:04,349
Tell Snowden when he comes in to let him go on.

854
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:05,641
Did you get that, Paul?

855
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:10,688
Six, five, four, three, two...

856
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:11,981
- ...one.
- VTA?

857
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:15,777
This has been the most divisive
meeting the oil states have ever had.

858
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:22,658
The 13 nations of OPEC have still
not been able to decide by how much...

859
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:25,119
...to increase the price of oil.
Saudi Arabian...

860
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:27,997
How much time we got?

861
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:30,917
--yesterday for further consultations
with his government.

862
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:32,418
He returned to the Vienna...

863
00:53:34,463 --> 00:53:37,632
- This is Ed Fletcher in Vienna.
- Take two, cue Howard.

864
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,302
I don't have to tell you things are bad,
everybody knows things are bad.

865
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,304
It's a depression.

866
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:47,308
Everybody's out of work
or scared of losing their job.

867
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,644
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.

868
00:53:49,812 --> 00:53:52,980
Banks are going bust.
Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.

869
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,899
Punks are running wild in the streets.

870
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:58,736
There's nobody anywhere who seems to
know what to do, and there's no end to it.

871
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:03,825
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

872
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:07,161
We sit watching our TVs while
some local newscaster tells us...

873
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:10,832
...that today we had 15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes...

874
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,127
...as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
We know things are bad.

875
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,170
Worse than bad, they're crazy.

876
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:19,632
Everything everywhere is going crazy,
so we don't go out anymore.

877
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,094
We sit in the house and the world
we're living in is getting smaller...

878
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:26,764
...and all we say is, "Please,
at least leave us alone in our living rooms.

879
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:29,892
Let me have my toaster and my TV,
and my steel-belted radials...

880
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,353
...and I won't say anything.
Just leave us alone!"

881
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:35,940
Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!

882
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:38,860
I don't want you to protest, to riot.

883
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:42,071
Don't write to your congressmen.
I wouldn't know what to tell you.

884
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,574
I don't know what to do about the depression...

885
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:47,034
...and the Russians,
and the crime in the street.

886
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:49,871
All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.

887
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:55,126
You've got to say, "I'm a human being,
goddamn it. My life has value."

888
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:02,175
So I want you to get up now.

889
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:05,595
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.

890
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:09,015
I want you to get up right now
and go to the window...

891
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:12,435
...open it and stick your head out
and yell:

892
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:17,148
"I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

893
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:20,443
- I want you to get up right now, get up...
- Stay with him.

894
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:24,071
...go to your windows, open them
and stick your head out and yell:

895
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,283
"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going
to take this anymore!"

896
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:30,536
- Things have got to change...
- How many stations does this go to?

897
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:32,955
Sixty-seven.
It goes to Louisville and Atlanta.

898
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:34,582
"We're not going to take this!"

899
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,418
Then we'll figure out the depression
and the inflation...

900
00:55:37,586 --> 00:55:40,713
...and the oil crisis,
but first get up out of your chairs...

901
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:44,342
...open the window, stick your head out
and yell and say it!

902
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,971
"I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

903
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:51,265
- Who are you talking to, Herb?
- WCGG, Atlanta.

904
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,060
- They yelling in Atlanta?
- Are they yelling in Atlanta?

905
00:55:54,228 --> 00:55:57,021
But first you've got to get mad.
You've gotta say:

906
00:55:57,189 --> 00:56:00,733
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going
to take this anymore!"

907
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:03,945
- They're yelling in Baton Rouge.
- Goddamn it.

908
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:05,905
Get up, get up out of your chairs.

909
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:09,158
Son of a bitch, we struck the mother lode!

910
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:11,953
Stick your head out of the window,
stick your head out.

911
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,704
And keep yelling and yell:

912
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:17,375
"I'm as mad as hell.
I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

913
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:20,419
Just get up from your chairs,
right now, go to the window!

914
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:23,005
- Where you going?
- I wanna see if anybody's yelling.

915
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:26,634
Open it, and stick your head out,
and yell, and keep yelling--

916
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:32,932
I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!

917
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,311
I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

918
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:40,189
I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

919
00:56:40,357 --> 00:56:42,984
I'm as mad as hell.
I'm not gonna take it anymore!

920
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,570
I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take it anymore.

921
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,989
I'm not gonna take it anymore.
I'm mad as hell!

922
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,657
I'm mad as hell!

923
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,495
I'm mad as hell!

924
00:56:54,663 --> 00:56:55,705
I'm mad as hell!

925
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:57,790
I'm mad as hell!

926
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:00,084
I'm mad as hell!

927
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:04,839
I'm mad as hell!
I'm not gonna take this anymore.

928
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:07,883
I'm mad as hell!
I'm not gonna take this anymore.

929
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,167
By mid-October...

930
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:43,711
...the Howard Beale Show
had settled in on a 42 share...

931
00:57:43,879 --> 00:57:47,506
...more than equaling all the other
network news shows combined.

932
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,884
In the Nielsen ratings, the Howard Beale Show...

933
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:52,887
...was listed as the fourth highest
rated show of the month...

934
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:55,389
...surpassed only
by The Six Million Dollar Man...

935
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,350
...All in the Family and Phyllis.

936
00:57:57,517 --> 00:58:00,311
A phenomenal state of affairs for a news show.

937
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:03,981
And on October 15,
Diana Christensen flew to Los Angeles...

938
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:06,525
...for what the trade calls
powwows and confabs...

939
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:08,653
...with our West Coast
programming execs...

940
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,031
...and to get production rolling
on the shows for the coming season.

941
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:13,783
Christ.

942
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:17,244
You brought half the William Morris
West Coast office along with you.

943
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:22,249
Hi, I'm Diana Christensen, a racist lackey
of the imperialist ruling circles.

944
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:25,002
I'm Laureen Hobbs,
a bad-ass commie nigger.

945
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,756
Sounds like the basis of a firm friendship.
We're gonna need more chairs.

946
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:30,633
- Anybody want coffee?
- I'd love some.

947
00:58:30,801 --> 00:58:31,842
You changed your tailor.

948
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,678
Coffee? Okay.

949
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:36,430
Want to come take some coffee orders?

950
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:42,269
This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood,
and his associate, Merrill Grant.

951
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:48,734
Ms. Christensen,
just what the hell's this all about?

952
00:58:48,902 --> 00:58:52,029
Because when a national television network...

953
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:55,783
...in the person of booby here,
comes to me...

954
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:59,620
...and says they want to put the ongoing
struggle of the oppressed masses...

955
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:03,916
...on prime-time television,
I have to regard this askance.

956
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:07,461
What Mr. Haywood was saying,
Ms. Christensen, was that our client...

957
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:13,300
...Ms. Hobbs, wants it up-front
that the political content of the show...

958
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:15,302
...has to be entirely in her control.

959
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:18,931
She can have it. I don't give a damn
about the political content.

960
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:24,311
- What kind of show did you have in mind?
- I'm interested in a weekly dramatic series...

961
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:27,940
...based on the Ecumenical Liberation Army.
And I'll tell you right now...

962
00:59:28,108 --> 00:59:31,026
...what the first show has to be:
a special on Mary Ann Gifford.

963
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,528
Let me tell you what I want.

964
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:36,240
I want a lot more film like the bank rip-off
the Ecumenical sent in.

965
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:39,034
The way I see the series is...

966
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:44,331
...each week we open with an authentic act
of political terrorism...

967
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,500
...taken on the spot,
in the actual moment.

968
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:49,336
Then we go to the drama
behind the opening film footage.

969
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:51,756
That's your job, Ms. Hobbs.

970
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:55,801
You gotta get the Ecumenicals to bring in
that film footage for us.

971
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:59,764
The network can't deal with them directly.
They are, after all, wanted criminals.

972
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:03,684
The Ecumenical Liberation Army
is an ultra-left sect...

973
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:08,606
...creating political confusion with wildcat
violence and pseudo-insurrectionary acts...

974
01:00:08,774 --> 01:00:10,900
...which the Communist Party
does not endorse.

975
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,195
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt.

976
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:17,198
We would not want to produce
a television show...

977
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,618
...celebrating historically
deviational terrorism.

978
01:00:20,786 --> 01:00:23,496
I'm offering an hour
of prime-time television every week...

979
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:26,081
...into which you can stick
whatever propaganda.

980
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:28,876
The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang...

981
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:31,587
...whose leader is an eccentric,
to say the least.

982
01:00:31,755 --> 01:00:35,424
He calls himself the Great Ahmed Kahn
and wears a hussar's shako.

983
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:39,929
Ms. Hobbs, we're talking about
30 to 50 million people a shot.

984
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,889
It's a lot better than handing out...

985
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:44,558
...mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners.

986
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:53,859
I'll have to take this matter
to the central Committee...

987
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:57,655
...and I'd better check it out
with the Great Ahmed Kahn.

988
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:03,744
I'll be in L.A. until Saturday,
and I'd like to get it rolling.

989
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:24,890
Okay?

990
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:42,241
Well, Ahmed, you ain't gonna believe this.

991
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:45,244
But I'm gonna make a TV star out of you.

992
01:01:45,412 --> 01:01:49,248
Just like Archie Bunker.

993
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,042
You gonna be a household word.

994
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:56,088
What the fuck are you talking about?

995
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:58,841
- Thirty seconds.
- All right, ready VTA.

996
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:01,135
One, you have the audience to pan.

997
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:03,888
- Two, you have the window to pull.
Twenty-five.

998
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,973
Three, you're on the announcer.

999
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:07,766
Twenty.

1000
01:02:09,978 --> 01:02:11,103
Stand by, VTA.

1001
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:15,149
Fifteen, 14, 13, 12...

1002
01:02:15,317 --> 01:02:19,987
- ...eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven...
- Roll VTA.

1003
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:23,824
...six, five, four, three...

1004
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:26,660
- ...two, one.
- Three, cue announcer.

1005
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:30,247
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it.
How do you feel?

1006
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:35,085
We're mad as hell
and we're not going to take this anymore!

1007
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:39,048
Ladies and gentlemen, the Network
News Hour with Sibyl the Soothsayer!

1008
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:46,805
Jim Webbing and his
It's-the-Emes Truth Department.

1009
01:02:50,518 --> 01:02:53,062
Ms. Mata Hari
and her Skeletons in the Closet.

1010
01:02:57,025 --> 01:03:00,527
And tonight, another segment of Vox Populi.

1011
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:08,619
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

1012
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:25,386
Edward George Ruddy died today.

1013
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:28,263
Edward George Ruddy
was the chairman of the board...

1014
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:33,227
...of the Union Broadcasting Systems
and he died at 11:00 this morning...

1015
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:37,940
...of a heart condition, and woe is us,
we're in a lot of trouble.

1016
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:47,241
So a rich little man with white hair died.

1017
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:49,994
What has that got to do
with the price of rice, right?

1018
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,079
And why is that woe to us?

1019
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:55,916
Because you people...

1020
01:03:56,084 --> 01:04:00,045
...and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.

1021
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:04,383
Because less than 3 percent
of you people read books.

1022
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,929
Because less than 15 percent of you
read newspapers.

1023
01:04:09,097 --> 01:04:12,766
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

1024
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:16,437
Right now, there is a whole
and entire generation...

1025
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:20,232
...that never knew anything
that didn't come out of this tube.

1026
01:04:21,026 --> 01:04:25,279
This tube is the Gospel.
The ultimate revelation.

1027
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:30,159
This tube can make or break presidents,
popes, prime ministers!

1028
01:04:30,326 --> 01:04:33,912
This tube is the most awesome goddamn force...

1029
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,581
...in the whole godless world!

1030
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:38,792
And woe is us if it ever falls
into the hands of the wrong people.

1031
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,504
And that's why woe is us
that Edward George Ruddy died.

1032
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:45,799
Because this company is now
in the hands of CCA...

1033
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,469
...the Communication Corporation
of America.

1034
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:51,597
There's a new chairman.
A man called Frank Hackett...

1035
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:54,099
...sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office
on the 20th floor!

1036
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:57,311
And when the 12th largest company
in the world...

1037
01:04:57,479 --> 01:05:01,982
...controls the most awesome,
goddamn propaganda force...

1038
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,942
...in the whole godless world...

1039
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,988
...who knows what shit will be peddled
for truth on this network.

1040
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:13,827
So you listen to me. Listen to me!
Television is not the truth.

1041
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:16,371
Television's a goddamned amusement park.

1042
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:20,876
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a traveling troupe of acrobats...

1043
01:05:21,044 --> 01:05:25,464
...storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers,
sideshow freaks, lion-tamers...

1044
01:05:25,632 --> 01:05:30,010
...and football players.
We're in the boredom-killing business.

1045
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:36,016
So if you want the truth, go to God.

1046
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:38,102
Go to your gurus.

1047
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,437
Go to yourselves.

1048
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:44,358
Because that's the only place
you're ever gonna find any real truth.

1049
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:50,072
But, man, you're never gonna get
any truth from us.

1050
01:05:50,365 --> 01:05:53,200
We'll tell you anything you want to hear.
We lie like hell.

1051
01:05:53,368 --> 01:05:56,286
We'll tell you that, uh,
Kojak always gets the killer...

1052
01:05:56,454 --> 01:05:59,373
...and that nobody ever gets cancer
in Archie Bunker's house.

1053
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,167
No matter how much trouble
the hero is in, don't worry...

1054
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:05,379
...just look at your watch,
at the end of the hour he's gonna win!

1055
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:08,173
We'll tell you any shit you want to hear.

1056
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:11,802
We deal in illusions, man.
None of it is true.

1057
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:16,306
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night...

1058
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:19,059
...all ages, colors, creeds.

1059
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:20,561
We're all you know.

1060
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:23,564
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we're spinning here.

1061
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:27,484
You're beginning to think the tube is
reality and that your own lives are unreal.

1062
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:29,611
You do whatever the tube tells you.

1063
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:31,864
Dress like the tube, you eat like the tube...

1064
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:35,033
...raise your children like the tube,
you think like the tube.

1065
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:38,412
This is mass madness, you maniacs.

1066
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,290
In God's name, you people are the real thing.

1067
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,542
We are the illusion.

1068
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:47,045
So turn off your television sets.
Turn them off now.

1069
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:50,549
Turn them off right now.
Turn them off and leave them off.

1070
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:54,511
Turn them off right in the middle of
the sentence I'm speaking to you now.

1071
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:56,597
Turn them off!

1072
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:13,238
UBS was running
at a cash flow break-even point...

1073
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:15,741
...after taking into account
$110 million...

1074
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:17,910
...of negative cash flow
from the network.

1075
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:21,538
It was clear the fat on the network
had to be flitched off.

1076
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:24,958
Please note an increase in projected
initial programming revenues...

1077
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:27,085
...in the amount of $21 million...

1078
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:31,757
...due to the phenomenal success
of the Howard Beale Show.

1079
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:36,845
I expect a positive cash flow
for the entire complex of 45 million...

1080
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:42,267
...achievable in this fiscal year,
a year, in short, ahead of schedule.

1081
01:07:42,644 --> 01:07:44,478
I go beyond that.

1082
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:47,773
This network may well be
the most significant profit center...

1083
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:50,067
...of the communications complex.

1084
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:54,238
And based upon the projected rate
of return on invested capital...

1085
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:57,157
...and if merger
is eventually accomplished...

1086
01:07:57,325 --> 01:07:59,493
...the communications complex
may well become...

1087
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:02,287
...the towering and most profitable center...

1088
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:05,874
...in the entire CCA empire.

1089
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:10,337
I await your questions and comments.

1090
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:12,714
Mr. Jensen?

1091
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:16,260
Very good, Frank. Exemplary. Keep it up.

1092
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:43,996
Buy you a cup of coffee?

1093
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:47,791
Hell, yes.

1094
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:53,171
- Do you have to get back to the office?
- Nothing that can't wait.

1095
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,269
I...

1096
01:09:07,437 --> 01:09:10,188
I drop down to the news studios
every now and then...

1097
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:13,775
...and ask Howard Beale about you,
and he says you're doing fine. Are you?

1098
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:15,277
No.

1099
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:19,448
- Are you keeping busy?
- Oh, in a fashion.

1100
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:23,618
This is the, uh, third funeral
I've been to in two weeks.

1101
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:28,707
I have two other friends
in the hospital whom I visit regularly...

1102
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:32,002
...and, uh, been to a couple of christenings.

1103
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:36,423
All my friends seem to be dying
or having grandchildren.

1104
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,301
You should be a grandfather yourself about now.

1105
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:42,095
You have a pregnant daughter
in Seattle, don't you?

1106
01:09:42,263 --> 01:09:47,100
Any day now.
My wife's out there for the occasion.

1107
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:55,275
I've thought many times of calling you.

1108
01:09:56,611 --> 01:09:58,612
I wish you had.

1109
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:05,911
You know, I bumped into Sibyl
the Soothsayer in the elevator last week.

1110
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,623
I said, "You know, Sibyl,
about four months ago you predicted...

1111
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:13,418
...I would get involved
with a craggy, middle-aged man...

1112
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:17,130
...and so far, all that's happened
has been one many-splendored night.

1113
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:20,217
I don't call that 'getting involved."'

1114
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:24,721
And she said, "Don't worry, you will."

1115
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:30,977
It was a many-splendored night,
wasn't it, Max?

1116
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,689
Yes, it was.

1117
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:39,486
Are we going to get involved, Max?

1118
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:43,407
Yes.

1119
01:10:44,117 --> 01:10:49,246
I need to become involved very much.
How about you?

1120
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:53,667
I've reached for the phone to call you
a hundred times.

1121
01:10:53,835 --> 01:10:57,045
I was sure you hated me for my part
in taking your news show away.

1122
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,842
I probably did. I don't know anymore.

1123
01:11:02,427 --> 01:11:07,180
All I know is, I can't get you out of my mind.

1124
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,895
Marty.
Marty, I know what NBC offered them...

1125
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:16,523
...so I'm saying go to 3.5...

1126
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:19,609
...and I want an option
for a third run on all of them.

1127
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:23,655
Marty, I'm in a big hurry and you and Charlie
are supposed to be negotiating this...

1128
01:11:23,823 --> 01:11:26,450
...so goodbye, good luck,
I'll see you Monday.

1129
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,455
Jimmy Caan's agent just called
and says absolutely nix.

1130
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:34,040
- Can't win them all.
- Where can I reach you later?

1131
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,042
You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.

1132
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:43,383
NBC's offering $3.25 mil...

1133
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:45,760
...per package
of five James Bond movies...

1134
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:51,141
...and I think I'm gonna steal them
for $3.5 million with a third run.

1135
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:01,985
And I'm gonna stick
The Mao Tse-Tung Hour in at 8...

1136
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:05,447
...because we're having a lot of trouble
selling The Mao Tse-Tung Hour.

1137
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:07,199
This way...

1138
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:20,295
That Mao Tse-Tung Hour's
turning into one big pain in the ass.

1139
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:25,675
We're having heavy legal problems
with the federal government right now.

1140
01:12:26,761 --> 01:12:29,554
Two FBI guys turned up
in Hackett's office last week...

1141
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:32,224
...and served us with a subpoena.

1142
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:37,938
They heard about our Flagstaff bank
rip-off film and they want it.

1143
01:12:39,023 --> 01:12:41,816
Hackett told the FBI to fuck off.

1144
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:48,865
No, but we're getting around the FBI...

1145
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:52,536
...by doing the show in collaboration
with the news division.

1146
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:55,580
We're standing on the First Amendment,
Freedom of the Press...

1147
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:57,624
...and the right to protect our sources.

1148
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:01,086
Walter thinks we can knock out
the misprision of felony charge. Ha, ha.

1149
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:12,055
But he says absolutely nix on going to series.

1150
01:13:12,223 --> 01:13:17,185
They'll hit us with conspiracy
and inducement to commit a crime.

1151
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:19,688
Christ, it's cold in here.

1152
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:23,024
See, we're paying these nuts
from the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

1153
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:26,278
...$10,000 a week in order to turn in
authentic film footage...

1154
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,446
...of their revolutionary activities...

1155
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:31,825
...and that can constitute inducement
to commit a crime.

1156
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:36,288
And Walter says we'll all wind up
in federal prison.

1157
01:13:36,664 --> 01:13:39,708
I said, "Walter, let the government sue us.

1158
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,878
Let the federal government sue us.
We'll take them to the Supreme Court.

1159
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:47,507
We'll be front page, mm, for months.

1160
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:50,552
The New York Times and The Washington Post...

1161
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,680
...will be writing two editorials a week
about us.

1162
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:57,100
We'll be front page for months.
We'll have more press than Watergate."

1163
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:01,813
All I need is six weeks' federal litigation...

1164
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:05,525
...and The Mao Tse-Tung Hour
can start carrying its own time slot.

1165
01:14:22,126 --> 01:14:26,087
What's really bugging me now
is my daytime programming.

1166
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:29,674
NBC's got a lock on daytime...

1167
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,968
...with their lousy game shows...

1168
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,888
...and I'd like to bust them.

1169
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:38,558
I'm thinking of doing a homosexual soap opera.

1170
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:40,435
The Dykes.

1171
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:44,731
The heart-rendering saga
about a woman hopelessly in love...

1172
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:49,194
...with her husband's mistress.
What do you think?

1173
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:02,707
How long has it been going on?

1174
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:06,753
A month.

1175
01:15:08,756 --> 01:15:11,966
I thought it was a transient thing,
blow over in a week.

1176
01:15:13,386 --> 01:15:18,973
And I still pray to God
it's just a menopausal infatuation.

1177
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:23,269
But it is an infatuation, Louise.

1178
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:28,650
There's no sense in my saying
I won't see her again, because I will.

1179
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:37,033
Do you want me to leave?
Check into a hotel?

1180
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:41,454
Do you love her?

1181
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:47,085
I don't know how I feel.

1182
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:51,047
I'm grateful I can feel anything.

1183
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:57,595
I know I'm obsessed with her.

1184
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,683
Then say it.

1185
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:06,396
Don't keep telling me that
you're obsessed, that you're infatuated.

1186
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:08,815
Say that you're in love with her.

1187
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,736
I'm in love with her.

1188
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:15,697
Then get out!

1189
01:16:15,865 --> 01:16:19,492
Go anywhere you want. Go to a hotel,
go live with her, but don't come back.

1190
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,327
Because after 25 years...

1191
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:25,248
...of building a home and raising a family
and all the senseless pain...

1192
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:29,169
...that we have inflicted on each other,
I'm damned if I'm gonna stand here...

1193
01:16:29,336 --> 01:16:32,005
...and have you tell me
you're in love with somebody else.

1194
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:37,218
Because this isn't a convention weekend
with your secretary, is it?

1195
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:41,681
Or some broad that you picked up
after three belts of booze.

1196
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:44,601
This is your great winter romance, isn't it?

1197
01:16:44,769 --> 01:16:48,688
Your last roar of passion before you settle
into your emeritus years.

1198
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:50,565
Is that what's left for me?

1199
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:54,778
Is that my share? She gets
the winter passion and I get the dotage.

1200
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,196
What am I supposed to do?

1201
01:16:56,363 --> 01:17:00,074
Am I supposed to sit home knitting
and purling while you slink back...

1202
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,368
...like some penitent drunk?

1203
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:04,579
I'm your wife, damn it.

1204
01:17:04,747 --> 01:17:06,873
If you can't work up a winter passion for me...

1205
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:10,043
...the least I require
is respect and allegiance.

1206
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:25,934
I hurt, don't you understand that?

1207
01:17:28,062 --> 01:17:30,605
I hurt badly.

1208
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,324
Oh, say something, for God's sake.

1209
01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:53,294
I've got nothing to say.

1210
01:18:04,098 --> 01:18:06,599
I won't give you up easily, Max.

1211
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:15,608
I think perhaps it is better if you move out.

1212
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,700
Does she love you, Max?

1213
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:31,332
I'm not sure she's capable of any real feelings.

1214
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,587
She's television generation.
She learned life from Bugs Bunny.

1215
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:39,757
The only reality she knows
comes to her over the TV set.

1216
01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:43,928
She's very carefully devised
a number of scenarios...

1217
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:47,849
...for all of us to play,
like the Movie of the Week.

1218
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,146
My God, look at us, Louise.

1219
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:56,941
Here we are going through
the obligatory middle of Act 2...

1220
01:18:57,109 --> 01:19:00,945
...scorned-wife-throws
peccant-husband-out scene.

1221
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:04,324
But don't worry,
I'll come back to you in the end.

1222
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,784
All of her plot outlines have me leaving her...

1223
01:19:06,952 --> 01:19:09,704
...and coming back to you,
because the audience won't buy...

1224
01:19:09,872 --> 01:19:12,582
...a rejection
of the happy American family.

1225
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:18,671
She does have one script in which I kill myself.

1226
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:23,718
An adapted for television version
of Anna Karenina...

1227
01:19:25,054 --> 01:19:27,555
...where she's Count Vronsky
and I'm Anna.

1228
01:19:32,728 --> 01:19:34,938
You're in for some dreadful grief, Max.

1229
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:39,317
I know.

1230
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,612
The Mao Tse-Tung Hour
went on the air March 14.

1231
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,031
It received a 47 share.

1232
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,118
The network promptly committed
to 15 shows with an option for 10 more.

1233
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:51,537
There were the usual contractual difficulties.

1234
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:55,500
"Equal to 20 percent, 20, except that
such percentages shall be 30 percent, 30...

1235
01:19:55,668 --> 01:19:58,169
...for 90-minute or longer
television programs."

1236
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:00,254
Have we settled that sublicensing thing?

1237
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:03,675
- No.
- We want a clear definition here.

1238
01:20:04,802 --> 01:20:09,180
"Gross proceeds should consist
of all funds the sublicensee receives...

1239
01:20:09,348 --> 01:20:14,143
...not merely the net amount remitted after
payment to the sublicensee or distributor."

1240
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,981
We're not sitting still for overhead charges
as a cost prior to distribution.

1241
01:20:18,148 --> 01:20:21,442
Don't fuck with my distribution costs.

1242
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,444
I'm making a lousy 215 per segment.

1243
01:20:23,612 --> 01:20:26,030
I'm already deficiting $25,000 a week
with Metro!

1244
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,449
I'm paying William Morris
10 percent off the top!

1245
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:31,744
I'm giving this turkey $10,000
and another five to this fruitcake.

1246
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,871
Don't start no shit with me about a piece.

1247
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:38,126
I'm paying Metro 20 percent for all foreign
and Canadian distribution after recoupment.

1248
01:20:38,293 --> 01:20:41,963
The Communist Party's not gonna see
a nickel until we go into syndication!

1249
01:20:42,131 --> 01:20:45,550
Come on, Laureen. The Party's in
for 7500 a week production expenses.

1250
01:20:45,718 --> 01:20:49,137
I'm not giving this pseudo-insurrectionary
sectarian a piece of my show.

1251
01:20:49,304 --> 01:20:53,349
I'm not giving him script approval. I'm not
cutting him in on my distribution charges.

1252
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,351
You fucking fascist!

1253
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:58,271
Did you see the film we made
of San Marino jail breakout...

1254
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:01,941
...demonstrating the rising up of
the seminal prisoner-class infrastructure?

1255
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:05,236
You can blow the seminal prisoner-class
infrastructure out your ass!

1256
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:07,989
I'm not knocking down
my goddamn distribution charges.

1257
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:13,745
Man, give her the fucking overhead clause.

1258
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:16,497
How did I get here?
Who's gonna believe this?

1259
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:19,125
I'm sitting here in a goddamn farmhouse
in Encino...

1260
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:24,839
Let's get back to Page 22,
5, small "A", Subsidiary Rights.

1261
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,382
Where are we now?

1262
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,801
Page 22, middle of the page.
Subsidiary Rights.

1263
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:32,597
"'Subsidiary rights' means
without limitation any and all rights..."

1264
01:21:43,817 --> 01:21:48,321
Over the past two days, you've all had
opportunity to meet Diana Christensen...

1265
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:51,574
...our vice president
in charge of programming.

1266
01:21:51,742 --> 01:21:56,287
This afternoon, you all saw some of
the stuff she's set up for the new season.

1267
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:09,467
You all know that she is the woman
behind the Howard Beale Show.

1268
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:19,977
We all know she's beautiful.

1269
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:23,272
We all know she's brainy.

1270
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:29,487
I was thinking, before we start digging
into our Chateaubriands...

1271
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:33,407
...let's show her how we feel about her.

1272
01:22:48,799 --> 01:22:51,384
We have the number-one show
in television!

1273
01:22:54,805 --> 01:22:56,556
At next year's affiliates' meeting...

1274
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:59,475
...I'll be standing here telling you
we've got the top five.

1275
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:08,568
Last year, we were
the number-four network...

1276
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:11,070
...next year we're number one!

1277
01:23:11,822 --> 01:23:15,908
We're number one! We're number one!

1278
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:17,702
We're number one!

1279
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:23,916
We're number one!

1280
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,214
It is exactly 7:00 here in Los Angeles.

1281
01:23:30,424 --> 01:23:34,427
And right now, over a million homes
using television in this city...

1282
01:23:34,595 --> 01:23:39,098
...are turning their dials to Channel 3
and that's our channel!

1283
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:48,024
Howard Beale!

1284
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:52,987
Stop it, stop it!

1285
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:54,947
Now you listen to me.

1286
01:23:55,115 --> 01:24:00,786
And listen carefully because this is your
goddamn life I'm talking about today.

1287
01:24:01,705 --> 01:24:04,999
In this country, when one company wants
to take over another company...

1288
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,460
...they buy up a controlling share
of the stock...

1289
01:24:07,628 --> 01:24:10,296
...but first they have to file notice
with the government.

1290
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:13,216
That's how CCA took over the company
that owns this network.

1291
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:16,385
But now, somebody's buying up CCA.

1292
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:20,097
Somebody called
the Western World Funding Corporation.

1293
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:21,891
They filed the notice this morning.

1294
01:24:22,059 --> 01:24:26,687
Well, just who in the hell is
the Western World Funding Corporation?

1295
01:24:26,897 --> 01:24:30,233
It is a consortium of banks
and insurance companies...

1296
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,861
...who are not buying CCA for themselves,
but as agents for somebody else.

1297
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:36,239
Who is this somebody else?
They won't tell you.

1298
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:38,699
They won't tell you,
they won't tell the Senate...

1299
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:42,870
...they won't tell the SEC, the FTC,
they won't tell the Justice Department...

1300
01:24:43,038 --> 01:24:45,748
This is Mr. Hackett.
Do you have a New York call for me?

1301
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,668
- The hell it ain't!
- Do you wanna turn that down, please?

1302
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:51,212
I will tell you who they're buying CCA for.

1303
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:56,550
They're buying it for the Saudi Arabian
Investment Corporation.

1304
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:58,719
They're buying it for the Arabs!

1305
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:00,346
Clarence? Frank Hackett here.

1306
01:25:00,514 --> 01:25:03,808
How's everything back in New York?
How's the good lady?

1307
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:10,856
All right, Clarence, take it easy.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1308
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:16,862
When? Tonight's show?
Clarence, take it easy.

1309
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:20,199
The Howard Beale Show is just going on out here.

1310
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:23,703
You guys get it three hours earlier
in New York. Clarence, take it easy.

1311
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,872
How the hell could I see it?
It's just going on now!

1312
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,710
And there's not a single law
in the books to stop them.

1313
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:34,505
When did Mr. Jensen call?

1314
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:41,387
We all know that the Arabs control
$16 billion in this country.

1315
01:25:41,555 --> 01:25:43,431
They own a chunk of 5th Avenue...

1316
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:47,893
...twenty downtown pieces of Boston.
A part of the port of New Orleans.

1317
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:50,521
An industrial park in Salt Lake City.

1318
01:25:50,689 --> 01:25:55,818
They own big hunks of the Atlanta Hilton,
the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...

1319
01:25:55,986 --> 01:25:57,737
...part of a bank in California...

1320
01:25:57,904 --> 01:25:59,864
...the Bank of the Commonwealth
in Detroit.

1321
01:26:00,032 --> 01:26:04,410
They control Aramco, so that puts
them into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.

1322
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:08,789
They're all over! New Jersey,
Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri...

1323
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,875
...and that's only what we know about.

1324
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:13,627
There's a hell of a lot more
we don't know about.

1325
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:16,255
Because all of those Arab petrol dollars...

1326
01:26:16,423 --> 01:26:18,758
...are washed through
Switzerland and Canada...

1327
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,843
...and the biggest banks in this country.

1328
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:24,722
For example, what we don't know
about is this CCA deal...

1329
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,892
...and all the other CCA deals.

1330
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:32,188
Right now the Arabs have screwed us
out of enough American dollars...

1331
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:35,733
...to come right back and, with our
own money, buy General Motors...

1332
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:40,112
...IBM, ITT, AT&T, Dupont, U.S. Steel...

1333
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,573
...and 20 other American companies.

1334
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:48,037
Hell, they already own half of England.
So listen to me.

1335
01:26:48,205 --> 01:26:52,458
Listen to me, goddamn it.
The Arabs are simply buying us.

1336
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:56,128
There's only one thing
that can stop them. You!

1337
01:26:57,089 --> 01:26:58,839
You!

1338
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:01,884
So I want you to get up now.

1339
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:04,804
I want you to get up out of your chairs.

1340
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:07,765
I want you to get up right now
and go to the phone.

1341
01:27:07,933 --> 01:27:11,811
I want you to get up from your chairs,
go to the phone, get in your cars...

1342
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:14,480
...drive into the Western Union
offices in town.

1343
01:27:14,648 --> 01:27:17,983
I want you to send a telegram
to the White House.

1344
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:20,528
- Oh, my God.
- By midnight tonight...

1345
01:27:20,695 --> 01:27:23,489
...I want a million telegrams
in the White House.

1346
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:27,618
I want them wading knee-deep
in telegrams at the White House.

1347
01:27:27,869 --> 01:27:32,915
I want you to get up right now and write
a telegram to President Ford saying:

1348
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:36,961
"I'm as mad as hell
and I'm not gonna take this anymore.

1349
01:27:37,129 --> 01:27:40,172
I don't want the banks
selling my country to the Arabs.

1350
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:43,509
I want the CCA deal stopped now.

1351
01:27:43,677 --> 01:27:46,929
I want the CCA deal stopped now.
Come on.

1352
01:27:47,097 --> 01:27:50,349
I want the CCA deal stopped now!

1353
01:27:50,517 --> 01:27:59,024
I want the CCA deal stopped now!

1354
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:16,208
- Look, could we have the room?
- Sure.

1355
01:28:24,634 --> 01:28:28,721
Well, I'd like to see a typescript
and run through a couple more times.

1356
01:28:29,306 --> 01:28:32,391
But as for this whole CCA deal
with the Saudis...

1357
01:28:32,559 --> 01:28:35,227
...you'd know a lot more
about that, Frank, than I would.

1358
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:37,146
Is it true?

1359
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:44,570
The CCA has 2 billion in loans
with the Saudis...

1360
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:47,740
...and they hold every pledge we've got.

1361
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:51,744
We need that Saudi money bad.

1362
01:28:53,914 --> 01:28:56,832
Disaster. The show is a disaster.

1363
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:01,420
Unmitigated disaster. The death knell.

1364
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:06,759
I'm ruined. I'm dead. Finished.

1365
01:29:07,427 --> 01:29:11,347
Maybe we're overstating
Beale's clout with the public.

1366
01:29:12,516 --> 01:29:15,100
An hour ago, Clarence McElheny
called me from New York.

1367
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:18,479
It was 10:00 in the east and our people
in the White House report...

1368
01:29:18,647 --> 01:29:21,482
...they were already knee-deep in telegrams.

1369
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,529
By tomorrow morning,
they'll be suffocating in telegrams.

1370
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:29,323
- Can the government stop the deal?
- They can hold it up.

1371
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:32,910
The SEC could hold this deal up
for 20 years, if they wanted to.

1372
01:29:33,161 --> 01:29:34,537
I'm finished.

1373
01:29:34,704 --> 01:29:38,207
Any second that phone's gonna ring
and Clarence McElheny is gonna tell me...

1374
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:41,210
...Mr. Jensen wants me in his office
tomorrow morning...

1375
01:29:41,378 --> 01:29:44,838
...so he can personally chop my head off.

1376
01:29:45,507 --> 01:29:47,883
Four hours ago, I was the sun god at CCA.

1377
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:52,137
Mr. Jensen's hand-picked golden boy,
the heir apparent.

1378
01:29:52,305 --> 01:29:56,892
Now, ha, ha, I'm a man without a corporation.

1379
01:29:57,978 --> 01:30:00,145
Let's get back to Howard Beale.

1380
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:04,650
You're not seriously gonna pull Beale
off the air?

1381
01:30:08,947 --> 01:30:12,950
Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale
and wants him discontinued.

1382
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:15,494
But he may be unhappy,
but he isn't stupid enough...

1383
01:30:15,662 --> 01:30:18,539
...to withdraw the number-one show
on television out of pique.

1384
01:30:18,707 --> 01:30:21,584
Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God!

1385
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:24,086
And the wrath of God wants Howard Beale fired!

1386
01:30:24,254 --> 01:30:26,755
Every other network will grab him
the minute he walks.

1387
01:30:26,923 --> 01:30:29,633
He'll be back on the air for ABC
and we'll lose 20 points--

1388
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:32,344
I'm gonna impale the son of a bitch
with a sharp stick!

1389
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:35,180
- Forty million loss in revenues.
- I'll take out a contract.

1390
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:38,642
- Let's not discount federal action...
- I'll hire professional killers.

1391
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:43,981
No, I'll do it myself.
I'll strangle him with a sash cord!

1392
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:47,484
--and a breach of the consent decree.
I don't think Jensen's gonna fire anybody.

1393
01:30:53,283 --> 01:30:54,700
Hackett.

1394
01:30:56,911 --> 01:31:00,372
Yes, Clarence.
I've already booked my flight.

1395
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,418
Uh, well, can you give me
a little more time than that?

1396
01:31:04,586 --> 01:31:07,296
I've got the red-eye flight,
I won't be back in New York...

1397
01:31:07,464 --> 01:31:09,632
...till 6 tomorrow morning.

1398
01:31:11,593 --> 01:31:13,636
That'll be just fine.

1399
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:15,554
I'll see you then.

1400
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:27,483
Mr. Jensen wants to meet
Howard Beale personally.

1401
01:31:28,026 --> 01:31:31,779
He wants Mr. Beale in his office
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1402
01:31:38,286 --> 01:31:40,996
The final revelation is at hand.

1403
01:31:41,164 --> 01:31:45,250
I have seen the shattering fulgurations
of ultimate clarity.

1404
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:50,255
The light is impending.
I bear witness to the light!

1405
01:32:11,069 --> 01:32:12,653
Good morning, Mr. Beale.

1406
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:15,531
- They tell me you're a madman.
- Only desultorily.

1407
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:18,033
- How are you now?
- I'm as mad as a hatter.

1408
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:19,868
Who isn't?

1409
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:22,621
I'm going to take you into our conference room.

1410
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:26,125
Seems more seemly a setting
for what I have to say to you.

1411
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,878
I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.

1412
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:32,923
I sold sewing machines and automobile parts...

1413
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:36,009
...hairbrushes and electronic equipment.

1414
01:32:36,177 --> 01:32:38,512
They say I can sell anything.

1415
01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:42,599
I'd like to try to sell something to you.

1416
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:49,815
Valhalla, Mr. Beale. Please, sit down.

1417
01:33:19,304 --> 01:33:24,099
You have meddled with the primal forces
of nature, Mr. Beale.

1418
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:28,604
And I won't have it! Is that clear?

1419
01:33:28,897 --> 01:33:31,356
You think you've merely stopped a business deal.

1420
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:33,066
That is not the case.

1421
01:33:33,234 --> 01:33:36,153
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars
out of this country...

1422
01:33:36,321 --> 01:33:38,197
...and now they must put it back!

1423
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:43,535
It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity,
it is ecological balance.

1424
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,872
You are an old man...

1425
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,876
...who thinks in terms
of nations and peoples.

1426
01:33:51,044 --> 01:33:54,421
There are no nations, there are no peoples.
There are no Russians.

1427
01:33:54,589 --> 01:33:57,049
There are no Arabs.
There are no Third Worlds.

1428
01:33:57,217 --> 01:33:58,383
There is no West!

1429
01:33:58,551 --> 01:34:03,514
There is only one holistic system of systems.

1430
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:05,891
One vast and immane...

1431
01:34:06,059 --> 01:34:08,894
...interwoven, interacting, multi-variate...

1432
01:34:09,062 --> 01:34:12,231
...multinational dominion of dollars.

1433
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:15,526
Petrol dollars, electro-dollars,
multi-dollars.

1434
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:21,448
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels.

1435
01:34:22,784 --> 01:34:27,246
It is the international system of currency
which determines...

1436
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:30,791
...the totality of life on this planet.

1437
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:36,255
That is the natural order of things today.

1438
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:41,134
That is the atomic...

1439
01:34:41,302 --> 01:34:43,428
...and subatomic...

1440
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:48,934
...and galactic structure
of things today.

1441
01:34:49,686 --> 01:34:51,770
And you have meddled...

1442
01:34:51,938 --> 01:34:56,483
...with the primal forces of nature!

1443
01:34:56,776 --> 01:35:02,281
And you will atone.

1444
01:35:02,907 --> 01:35:05,284
Am I getting it through to you, Mr. Beale?

1445
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:13,292
You get up on your little 21-inch screen...

1446
01:35:14,002 --> 01:35:18,881
...and howl about America
and democracy.

1447
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:23,802
There is no America.
There is no democracy.

1448
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:29,474
There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T...

1449
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:35,230
...and Dupont, Dow,
Union Carbide, and Exxon.

1450
01:35:35,398 --> 01:35:38,984
Those are the nations of the world today.

1451
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,488
What do you think the Russians talk about
in their councils of state? Karl Marx?

1452
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:45,991
They get out their linear programming charts...

1453
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,660
...statistical decision theories,
minimax solutions...

1454
01:35:48,828 --> 01:35:52,289
...and compute price-cost probabilities
of transactions and investments...

1455
01:35:52,457 --> 01:35:53,498
...just like we do.

1456
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,253
We no longer live in a world of nations
and ideologies, Mr. Beale.

1457
01:35:58,421 --> 01:36:03,091
The world is a college of corporations...

1458
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:10,641
...inexorably determined
by the immutable bylaws of business.

1459
01:36:12,727 --> 01:36:15,687
The world is a business, Mr. Beale.

1460
01:36:17,607 --> 01:36:21,568
It has been since man crawled out of the slime.

1461
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:29,284
And our children will live, Mr. Beale...

1462
01:36:30,662 --> 01:36:32,245
...to see that...

1463
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:37,292
...perfect world...

1464
01:36:38,294 --> 01:36:41,505
...in which there's no war or famine...

1465
01:36:41,673 --> 01:36:45,008
...oppression or brutality.

1466
01:36:46,052 --> 01:36:50,013
One vast and ecumenical holding company...

1467
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:54,476
...for whom all men will work
to serve a common profit...

1468
01:36:54,644 --> 01:36:58,897
...in which all men will hold
a share of stock...

1469
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:03,068
...all necessities provided...

1470
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:07,614
...all anxieties tranquillized...

1471
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:12,494
...all boredom amused.

1472
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:23,046
And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...

1473
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:25,716
...to preach this evangel.

1474
01:37:26,384 --> 01:37:28,010
Why me?

1475
01:37:29,262 --> 01:37:32,097
Because you're on television, dummy.

1476
01:37:32,974 --> 01:37:38,437
Sixty million people watch you every night
of the week, Monday through Friday.

1477
01:37:39,313 --> 01:37:41,606
I have seen the face of God.

1478
01:37:44,152 --> 01:37:46,737
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

1479
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:50,615
That evening, Howard Beale went on the air...

1480
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:53,452
...to preach the corporate cosmology
of Arthur Jensen.

1481
01:37:53,619 --> 01:37:56,496
Last night I got up here and asked you people...

1482
01:37:56,664 --> 01:38:00,959
...to stand up and fight for your heritage,
and you did, and it was beautiful.

1483
01:38:01,127 --> 01:38:04,129
Six million telegrams were received
at the White House.

1484
01:38:04,297 --> 01:38:07,466
The Arab takeover of CCA has been stopped.

1485
01:38:07,633 --> 01:38:13,305
The people spoke, the people won.
It was a radiant eruption of democracy.

1486
01:38:13,473 --> 01:38:17,517
But I think that was it, fellas.

1487
01:38:17,685 --> 01:38:20,395
That sort of thing is not likely
to happen again.

1488
01:38:20,605 --> 01:38:23,565
Because at the bottom
of all our terrified souls...

1489
01:38:23,733 --> 01:38:26,777
...we know that democracy
is a dying giant...

1490
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:31,740
...a sick, sick, dying, decaying,
political concept writhing in its final pain.

1491
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:35,494
I don't mean that the United States
is finished as a world power.

1492
01:38:35,661 --> 01:38:37,829
The States is the richest and most powerful...

1493
01:38:37,997 --> 01:38:40,957
...the most advanced country,
light years ahead of any country.

1494
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:43,835
I don't mean the communists
are gonna take over the world.

1495
01:38:44,003 --> 01:38:47,339
The communists are deader than we are.
What is finished...

1496
01:38:48,966 --> 01:38:52,427
...is the idea that this great country
is dedicated to the freedom...

1497
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:56,306
...and flourishing of every individual in it.

1498
01:38:57,391 --> 01:39:00,352
It's the individual that's finished.

1499
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:04,689
It's the single, solitary, human being
that's finished.

1500
01:39:05,566 --> 01:39:09,611
It's every single one of you out there
that's finished.

1501
01:39:10,154 --> 01:39:12,364
Because this is no longer...

1502
01:39:12,532 --> 01:39:16,243
...a nation of independent individuals.

1503
01:39:16,536 --> 01:39:19,329
It's a nation of some 200-odd million...

1504
01:39:19,497 --> 01:39:22,040
...transistorized, deodorized...

1505
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:27,712
...whiter than white steel-belted bodies,
totally unnecessary as human beings...

1506
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,258
...and as replaceable as piston rods.

1507
01:39:41,894 --> 01:39:45,105
Well, the time has come to say...

1508
01:39:45,273 --> 01:39:48,441
...is "dehumanization" such a bad word?

1509
01:39:48,818 --> 01:39:51,903
Whether it's good or bad, that's what is so.

1510
01:39:52,071 --> 01:39:57,242
The whole world is becoming humanoid,
creatures that look human but aren't.

1511
01:39:57,702 --> 01:39:59,077
The whole world, not just us.

1512
01:39:59,245 --> 01:40:03,415
We're just the most advanced country,
so we're getting there first.

1513
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:09,045
The whole world's people are becoming
mass-produced, programmed...

1514
01:40:09,213 --> 01:40:10,964
...numbered insensate things.

1515
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:13,425
It was a perfectly admissible argument...

1516
01:40:13,593 --> 01:40:16,178
...that Howard Beale advanced
in the days that followed.

1517
01:40:16,345 --> 01:40:19,222
It was, however, also a very depressing one.

1518
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:22,726
Nobody particularly cared to hear
his life was utterly valueless.

1519
01:40:22,894 --> 01:40:24,728
By the end of the first week in June...

1520
01:40:24,896 --> 01:40:27,647
...the Howard Beale Show
dropped one point in the ratings...

1521
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:32,444
...and its trend of shares dipped under 48
for the first time since last November.

1522
01:40:32,612 --> 01:40:36,615
You're his goddamn agent. I'm counting
on you to talk some sense into the lunatic.

1523
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:40,285
Nobody wants to hear about
dying democracy and dehumanization.

1524
01:40:40,912 --> 01:40:41,995
I'm sorry I'm late.

1525
01:40:42,163 --> 01:40:44,372
We're starting to get rumbles from the agencies.

1526
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:47,334
Another couple of weeks
and the sponsors will be bailing out!

1527
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:50,629
This is a breach of contract.
This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.

1528
01:40:50,796 --> 01:40:55,091
Get him off that corporate universe kick,
or so help me, I'll pull it off the air!

1529
01:40:55,259 --> 01:40:58,386
I told him, Lou! I've been telling him
every day for a week!

1530
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:01,640
I'm sick of telling him. Now you tell him!

1531
01:41:09,523 --> 01:41:10,899
Jesus Christ.

1532
01:41:14,403 --> 01:41:16,738
You could help me out
with Howard if you wanted to.

1533
01:41:16,906 --> 01:41:19,157
He listens to you. You're his best friend.

1534
01:41:19,325 --> 01:41:21,785
I'm tired of all this hysteria
about Howard Beale.

1535
01:41:21,953 --> 01:41:24,621
Every time you come
from seeing somebody in your family...

1536
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:27,123
...you come back in one of these
middle-aged moods.

1537
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:30,335
I'm tired of finding you on the telephone
every time I turn around.

1538
01:41:30,503 --> 01:41:33,338
I'm tired of being an accessory in your life.

1539
01:41:33,798 --> 01:41:36,341
And I'm tired of pretending to write
this dumb book...

1540
01:41:36,509 --> 01:41:39,678
...about my maverick days
in the great early years of television.

1541
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:43,515
Every goddamned executive fired
from a network in the last 20 years...

1542
01:41:43,683 --> 01:41:47,686
...has written this dumb book
about the great early years of television.

1543
01:41:47,853 --> 01:41:51,147
And nobody wants a dumb, damn, goddamn book...

1544
01:41:51,315 --> 01:41:53,525
...about the early days of television.

1545
01:41:53,693 --> 01:41:56,736
Terrific, Max! Maybe you can start
a whole new career as an actor.

1546
01:41:56,904 --> 01:41:58,613
It's the truth.

1547
01:41:59,365 --> 01:42:04,119
After living with you for six months,
I'm turning into one of your scripts.

1548
01:42:04,912 --> 01:42:07,372
Well, this is not a script, Diana.

1549
01:42:07,707 --> 01:42:11,334
There's some real, actual life going on here.

1550
01:42:12,128 --> 01:42:15,714
I went to visit my wife today
because she's in a state of depression...

1551
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:19,551
...so depressed that my daughter flew
all the way from Seattle to be with her.

1552
01:42:19,719 --> 01:42:21,720
And I feel lousy about that.

1553
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:26,016
I feel lousy about the pain
that I've caused my wife and my kids.

1554
01:42:26,183 --> 01:42:28,101
I feel guilty and conscience-stricken...

1555
01:42:28,269 --> 01:42:30,895
...and all of those things
that you think sentimental...

1556
01:42:31,063 --> 01:42:35,025
...but which my generation
calls simple, human decency.

1557
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:41,072
And I miss my home...

1558
01:42:41,782 --> 01:42:44,617
...because I'm beginning
to get scared shitless.

1559
01:42:44,785 --> 01:42:48,246
Because all of a sudden it's closer
to the end than it is to the beginning.

1560
01:42:48,414 --> 01:42:51,374
And death is suddenly
a perceptible thing to me...

1561
01:42:51,542 --> 01:42:54,044
...with definable features.

1562
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:02,469
You're dealing with a man
that has primal doubts, Diana...

1563
01:43:02,803 --> 01:43:05,263
...and you've got to cope with it.

1564
01:43:05,848 --> 01:43:09,934
I'm not some guy discussing male
menopause on the Barbara Walters Show.

1565
01:43:10,603 --> 01:43:13,938
I'm the man that you presumably love.

1566
01:43:15,024 --> 01:43:17,942
I'm part of your life.

1567
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:21,780
I live here. I'm real.

1568
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:25,825
You can't switch to another station.

1569
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:36,127
What exactly is it you want me to do?

1570
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:43,176
I just want you to love me.

1571
01:43:44,428 --> 01:43:47,889
I just want you to love me,
primal doubts and all.

1572
01:43:50,226 --> 01:43:52,644
You understand that, don't you?

1573
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,943
I don't know how to do that.

1574
01:44:11,664 --> 01:44:14,290
I'll be with you in a minute, Max.

1575
01:44:19,422 --> 01:44:20,922
By the first week in July...

1576
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,216
...the Howard Beale Show
was down 11 points.

1577
01:44:23,384 --> 01:44:25,218
Hysteria swept through the network.

1578
01:44:25,386 --> 01:44:27,053
He's a plague. He's smallpox.

1579
01:44:27,221 --> 01:44:29,722
He's typhoid.
I don't wanna follow his goddamn show.

1580
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:31,224
I want out of that 8:00 spot.

1581
01:44:31,392 --> 01:44:34,102
I've got enough troubles
without Howard Beale as a lead-in!

1582
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,354
Scheduled me against Tony Orlando and Dawn.

1583
01:44:36,522 --> 01:44:39,774
NBC's got Little House on the Prairie.
ABC's got The Bionic Woman.

1584
01:44:39,942 --> 01:44:42,527
Do something! You gotta do something
about Howard Beale!

1585
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:44,863
Get him off the air! Get him off!

1586
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:46,656
Do something! Do anything!

1587
01:44:46,824 --> 01:44:48,825
We're trying to find a replacement for him!

1588
01:44:48,993 --> 01:44:51,035
I'm going to look at audition footage now!

1589
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:54,747
And how when the sicks heal...

1590
01:44:54,915 --> 01:44:57,876
...man, I tell you I saw it!

1591
01:44:58,711 --> 01:45:03,798
It was heavy, baby.
I saw the earth quake.

1592
01:45:03,966 --> 01:45:07,719
And I saw the moon became like blood.

1593
01:45:07,887 --> 01:45:11,764
And every mountain and island
was moved from its place.

1594
01:45:11,932 --> 01:45:14,184
No, no, no. Damn it.

1595
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:16,352
If we wanted hellfire we'd get Billy Graham!

1596
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,898
Don't want faith healers, evangelists
or Oberammergau passion players!

1597
01:45:20,065 --> 01:45:23,109
What about that messiah
that ABC was supposed to have signed up...

1598
01:45:23,277 --> 01:45:25,945
- ...as our competition for next year?
- That's him.

1599
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:30,408
- The bottomless pit is here.
- That's him?

1600
01:45:30,576 --> 01:45:32,452
His ass ending.

1601
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:34,662
Jesus. Turn him off!

1602
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:39,584
I've got three more,
but you've already seen the best ones.

1603
01:45:39,752 --> 01:45:42,587
I've got a guru from Spokane
and two more hellfires...

1604
01:45:42,755 --> 01:45:44,547
...who see visions of the Virgin Mary.

1605
01:45:44,715 --> 01:45:48,510
We're not gonna find a replacement for
Howard Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.

1606
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:51,513
Fully fledged messiahs don't come in bunches.

1607
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,849
We either go with Howard Beale
or we go without him.

1608
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:57,894
My reports say we'll do better without him.

1609
01:45:58,062 --> 01:46:00,939
It would be disaster to let this situation
go on another week.

1610
01:46:01,106 --> 01:46:03,733
By then, he'll be down 16 points...

1611
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:07,278
...and the trend irreversible,
if it isn't already.

1612
01:46:08,489 --> 01:46:11,574
I think we should fire Howard.

1613
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:20,124
Arthur Jensen has taken a strong personal
interest in the Howard Beale Show.

1614
01:46:22,127 --> 01:46:25,588
I'm having dinner with him tonight.
Let me have another crack at Jensen...

1615
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:28,174
...and then let's meet in my office
at 10:00 tonight.

1616
01:46:28,342 --> 01:46:31,135
Diana, give me copies
of all your audience research reports.

1617
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:35,431
I may need them for Jensen.
Is 10:00 convenient for everyone?

1618
01:47:07,464 --> 01:47:11,718
I think the time has come
to re-evaluate our relationship, Max.

1619
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:14,012
So I see.

1620
01:47:15,598 --> 01:47:18,975
I don't like the way this script of ours
is turning out.

1621
01:47:19,143 --> 01:47:21,936
It's turning into a seedy little drama.

1622
01:47:22,104 --> 01:47:26,441
Middle-aged man leaves wife and family
for young heartless woman, goes to pot.

1623
01:47:26,609 --> 01:47:30,361
The Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings. I don't like it.

1624
01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:32,614
- So you're gonna cancel the show.
- Right.

1625
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:34,699
Here, let me do that.

1626
01:47:36,285 --> 01:47:41,414
The simple fact is, Max,
that you're a family man.

1627
01:47:41,582 --> 01:47:45,335
You like a home and kids. That's beautiful.
I'm incapable of any such commitment.

1628
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:48,421
All you'll get from me is
a couple months of intermittent sex...

1629
01:47:48,589 --> 01:47:51,966
...and recriminate and ugly little scenes
like the one we had last night.

1630
01:47:52,134 --> 01:47:55,720
I'm sorry for all those things
I said to you last night.

1631
01:47:55,888 --> 01:48:00,224
You're not the worst fuck I've ever had.
Believe me, I've had worse.

1632
01:48:00,726 --> 01:48:04,103
You don't puff or snorkle...

1633
01:48:04,271 --> 01:48:05,980
...and make death-like rattles.

1634
01:48:06,148 --> 01:48:08,941
As a matter of fact,
you're rather serene in the sack.

1635
01:48:10,277 --> 01:48:12,153
Why is it that a woman always thinks...

1636
01:48:12,321 --> 01:48:17,533
...that the most savage thing she can say
to a man is to impugn his cocksmanship?

1637
01:48:18,744 --> 01:48:22,080
Well, I'm sorry I impugned your cocksmanship.

1638
01:48:22,748 --> 01:48:26,542
I gave up comparing genitals
back in the schoolyard.

1639
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:38,930
You're being docile as hell about this.

1640
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:43,476
Oh, hell, Diana,
I knew it was over with us weeks ago.

1641
01:48:43,811 --> 01:48:46,479
Will you go back to your wife?

1642
01:48:48,482 --> 01:48:51,275
I'll give it a try,
but I don't think she'll jump at it.

1643
01:48:51,443 --> 01:48:53,695
But don't worry about me. I'll manage.

1644
01:48:53,862 --> 01:48:58,199
I always have, I always will.
I'm more concerned about you.

1645
01:48:59,034 --> 01:49:00,785
You're not the boozer type.

1646
01:49:00,953 --> 01:49:04,497
So I figure a year, maybe two,
before you crack up.

1647
01:49:04,665 --> 01:49:07,333
Or jump out of your 14th floor office window.

1648
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:10,712
Stop selling, Max. I don't need you.

1649
01:49:22,099 --> 01:49:25,977
I don't want your pain. I don't want
your menopausal decay and death!

1650
01:49:26,145 --> 01:49:27,228
I don't need you, Max.

1651
01:49:27,396 --> 01:49:31,149
- Now get out of here!
- You need me! You need me badly.

1652
01:49:31,316 --> 01:49:34,110
Because I'm your last contact
with human reality.

1653
01:49:34,278 --> 01:49:36,279
I love you.

1654
01:49:36,447 --> 01:49:40,450
And that painful, decaying love
is the only thing between you...

1655
01:49:40,617 --> 01:49:43,536
...and the shrieking nothingness
you live the rest of the day.

1656
01:49:43,704 --> 01:49:45,329
Then don't leave me.

1657
01:49:48,459 --> 01:49:50,668
It's too late, Diana.

1658
01:49:51,795 --> 01:49:54,672
There's nothing left in you
that I can live with.

1659
01:49:57,384 --> 01:49:59,927
You're one of Howard's humanoids...

1660
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:02,764
...and if I stay with you,
I'll be destroyed.

1661
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:06,017
Like Howard Beale was destroyed.

1662
01:50:06,518 --> 01:50:09,145
Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.

1663
01:50:09,688 --> 01:50:13,524
Like everything that you
and the institution of television touch...

1664
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:15,735
...is destroyed.

1665
01:50:21,533 --> 01:50:23,534
You're television incarnate, Diana.

1666
01:50:24,953 --> 01:50:30,333
Indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy.

1667
01:50:31,627 --> 01:50:35,671
All of life is reduced
to the common rubble of banality.

1668
01:50:39,384 --> 01:50:42,303
War, murder, death...

1669
01:50:43,055 --> 01:50:46,224
...all the same to you
as bottles of beer.

1670
01:50:46,767 --> 01:50:51,437
And the daily business of life
is a corrupt comedy.

1671
01:50:52,606 --> 01:50:55,983
You even shatter the sensations
of time and space...

1672
01:50:56,151 --> 01:51:00,905
...into split seconds and instant replays.

1673
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,369
You're madness, Diana.

1674
01:51:08,205 --> 01:51:10,540
Virulent madness.

1675
01:51:12,251 --> 01:51:15,378
And everything you touch dies with you.

1676
01:51:20,217 --> 01:51:22,009
But not me.

1677
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:28,641
Not as long as I can feel pleasure and pain...

1678
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:34,146
...and love.

1679
01:51:45,576 --> 01:51:46,659
And it's a happy ending.

1680
01:51:48,954 --> 01:51:52,623
Wayward husband comes to his senses...

1681
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,834
...returns to his wife...

1682
01:51:55,043 --> 01:51:58,045
...with whom he's established
a long and sustaining love.

1683
01:51:59,256 --> 01:52:03,301
Heartless young woman left alone
in her arctic desolation.

1684
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:08,639
Music up with a swell.

1685
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,352
Final commercial.

1686
01:52:15,981 --> 01:52:19,567
And here are a few scenes from next week's show.

1687
01:52:31,496 --> 01:52:33,372
How did it go?

1688
01:52:50,015 --> 01:52:55,186
Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea
of taking Howard Beale off the air.

1689
01:52:56,438 --> 01:53:00,358
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale
is bringing a very important message...

1690
01:53:00,525 --> 01:53:02,944
...to the American people.

1691
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:07,865
So he wants Howard Beale on the air
and he wants him kept on.

1692
01:53:10,118 --> 01:53:13,120
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic
in our thinking.

1693
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:17,458
I argued that television was a volatile
industry in which success and failure...

1694
01:53:17,626 --> 01:53:20,211
...were determined week by week.

1695
01:53:20,879 --> 01:53:24,382
Mr. Jensen said he did not like
volatile industries and suggested...

1696
01:53:24,549 --> 01:53:28,052
...with a certain sinister silkiness...

1697
01:53:28,929 --> 01:53:32,556
...that volatility in business
usually reflected bad management.

1698
01:53:33,558 --> 01:53:36,811
He didn't care if Howard Beale
was the number-one show or the 50th.

1699
01:53:36,979 --> 01:53:39,438
He didn't really care
if the Beale Show lost money.

1700
01:53:40,649 --> 01:53:45,111
He wants Howard Beale on the air
and he wants him kept on.

1701
01:53:45,821 --> 01:53:50,491
I would describe his position on this
as inflexible.

1702
01:53:51,243 --> 01:53:53,619
Where does that put us, Diana?

1703
01:53:54,496 --> 01:53:58,416
That puts us in the shithouse,
that's where that puts us.

1704
01:54:01,044 --> 01:54:03,879
- Do you want me to go through this?
- Yes.

1705
01:54:04,965 --> 01:54:09,260
The Beale Show Q score's down to 33.

1706
01:54:09,928 --> 01:54:13,389
Most of this loss occurred in the child
and teen and 18-34 categories...

1707
01:54:13,557 --> 01:54:16,809
...which were our key core markets.

1708
01:54:17,019 --> 01:54:20,146
And as the AR department's carefully
considered judgment and mine...

1709
01:54:20,313 --> 01:54:23,691
...that if we get rid of Beale,
we should maintain a respectable share...

1710
01:54:23,859 --> 01:54:26,736
...in the high 20s, possibly 30,
with a comparable Q level.

1711
01:54:26,903 --> 01:54:29,447
The other segments of the show,
Sibyl the Soothsayer...

1712
01:54:29,614 --> 01:54:33,784
...Jim Webbing, the Vox Populi,
have all developed their own audiences.

1713
01:54:33,952 --> 01:54:36,120
Our AR reports show that it is Howard Beale...

1714
01:54:36,288 --> 01:54:39,123
...that is the destructive force here.

1715
01:54:39,708 --> 01:54:44,503
Minimally, we're talking about
a 10-point differential in shares.

1716
01:54:45,464 --> 01:54:48,466
I think Joe ought
to spell it out for us. Joe?

1717
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:52,094
A 28 share is 80,000-dollar minutes.

1718
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:54,889
I think we can sell complete positions
on the whole.

1719
01:54:55,057 --> 01:54:57,683
We're just getting
into the pre-Christmas gift sellers...

1720
01:54:57,851 --> 01:55:01,395
...and I'll tell you the agencies are coming
back to me with $4 CPM's.

1721
01:55:01,563 --> 01:55:05,816
If that's any indication, we're talking 40-,
45 million-dollar loss in annual revenues.

1722
01:55:05,984 --> 01:55:07,985
Wanna hear the flak from the affiliates?

1723
01:55:08,153 --> 01:55:09,653
We know all about it, Herb.

1724
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:13,616
And you would describe Mr. Jensen's
position on Beale as inflexible?

1725
01:55:14,117 --> 01:55:16,619
Intractable and adamantine.

1726
01:55:18,497 --> 01:55:21,665
So, what do we do
about this Beale son of a bitch?

1727
01:55:23,835 --> 01:55:25,920
I suppose we'll have to kill him.

1728
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,926
I don't suppose you have any ideas
on that, Diana?

1729
01:55:38,642 --> 01:55:41,685
Well, what would you fellows say
to an assassination?

1730
01:55:43,188 --> 01:55:47,191
I think I can get the Mao Tse-Tung people
to kill Beale for us...

1731
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:48,526
...as one of their shows.

1732
01:55:49,736 --> 01:55:54,198
In fact, it'll make a hell of a kickoff show
for the season.

1733
01:55:54,366 --> 01:55:57,868
We're facing heavy opposition on the
other networks for Wednesday nights...

1734
01:55:58,036 --> 01:56:01,455
...and The Mao Tse-Tung Hour
could use a sensational opener.

1735
01:56:02,916 --> 01:56:06,710
It could be done right on camera in the studio.

1736
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:10,548
We ought to get
a fantastic look-in audience...

1737
01:56:10,715 --> 01:56:14,677
...for the assassination
of Howard Beale as our opening show.

1738
01:56:14,845 --> 01:56:19,557
Well, if Beale dies, what would
our continuing obligation...

1739
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:21,767
...to the Beale corporation be?

1740
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:24,895
I know our contract with Beale
contains a buy-out clause...

1741
01:56:25,063 --> 01:56:27,189
...triggered by his death or incapacity.

1742
01:56:27,357 --> 01:56:30,651
There must be a formula
for the computation of the purchase price.

1743
01:56:30,819 --> 01:56:34,780
Offhand, I think it was based
on a multiple 1975 earnings...

1744
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:37,074
...with the base period in 1975.

1745
01:56:37,492 --> 01:56:41,537
I think it was 50 percent of salary
plus 25 percent of the first year's profit...

1746
01:56:41,705 --> 01:56:44,999
...multiplied by the unexpired portion
of the contract.

1747
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:48,127
I don't think the show has
any substantial syndication value...

1748
01:56:48,295 --> 01:56:49,461
...would you say, Diana?

1749
01:56:49,629 --> 01:56:51,338
Syndication profits are minimal.

1750
01:56:52,674 --> 01:56:55,342
We're talking about a capital crime here.

1751
01:56:56,469 --> 01:56:59,013
The network can't be implicated.

1752
01:57:09,524 --> 01:57:13,736
I hope you don't have any hidden
tape machines in this office, Frank.

1753
01:57:15,864 --> 01:57:18,741
Well, the issue is,
shall we kill Howard Beale or not?

1754
01:57:18,909 --> 01:57:21,368
I'd like to hear some more opinions on that.

1755
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,955
I don't see we have any option, Frank.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

1756
01:57:25,207 --> 01:57:28,584
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it.
How do you feel?

1757
01:57:28,752 --> 01:57:33,130
We're mad as hell
and we're not going to take this anymore!

1758
01:57:33,298 --> 01:57:35,382
Ladies and gentlemen, the Network News Hour...

1759
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,801
...with Sibyl the Soothsayer.

1760
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:44,308
Jim Webbing and his It's-the-Emes
Truth Department.

1761
01:57:47,062 --> 01:57:50,940
Ms. Mata Hari and her
Skeletons in the Closet.

1762
01:57:53,652 --> 01:57:55,986
And tonight, another segment of Vox Populi.

1763
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:05,162
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

1764
01:58:24,641 --> 01:58:29,019
The Network News anchorman
on the UBS Network News show...

1765
01:58:29,187 --> 01:58:33,065
...known to millions as the Mad Prophet
of the Airways...

1766
01:58:33,233 --> 01:58:37,069
...was shot to death tonight
in a fusillade of automatic-rifle fire...

1767
01:58:37,237 --> 01:58:40,030
...just as he began
this evening's broadcast.

1768
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:42,283
We never compromise, so why should you?

1769
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:44,827
Canada Dry mixers, why compromise?

1770
01:58:44,995 --> 01:58:48,038
--identified themselves as
the group responsible for the killing.

1771
01:58:48,206 --> 01:58:51,709
Ahmed Kahn, a massive man of well
over 6 feet, carrying an automatic weapon.

1772
01:58:51,876 --> 01:58:53,544
Supposed to be good for you.

1773
01:58:53,712 --> 01:58:57,256
- Did you try it?
- I'm not gonna try it, you try it.

1774
01:58:57,424 --> 01:59:00,509
- I'm not gonna try it.
- Let's get Mikey.

1775
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:03,554
Yeah. He won't eat it.
He hates everything.

1776
01:59:03,722 --> 01:59:05,222
The extraordinary incident...

1777
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:07,641
...occurred in full view
of his millions of viewers.

1778
01:59:07,809 --> 01:59:10,060
The assassins were members
of a terrorist group...

1779
01:59:10,228 --> 01:59:14,315
...called the Ecumenical Liberation Army,
two of whom were apprehended.

1780
01:59:14,482 --> 01:59:17,901
The leader of the group, known
as the Great Ahmed Kahn, escaped.

1781
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,612
This was the story of Howard Beale...

1782
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:23,324
...the first known instance
of a man who was killed...

1783
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:25,117
...because he had lousy ratings.
