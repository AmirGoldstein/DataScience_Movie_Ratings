1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,135
<i>STEVE BUSCEMI: I love all the
visual stuff in the dream sequence.</i>

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,763
I like the fact that
it comes out of left field.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,562
<i>JOHN GOODMAN: Valkyrie,
Busby Berkeley, bowling,</i>

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,797
if you want to have dreams,
those are the ones to have.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,868
You're in the realm
with the Dude, man.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,751
<i>ETHAN COEN: There are two
dream sequences in the movie.</i>

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,278
<i>It's an excuse to do
something different visually,</i>

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,409
and make a little splash
tonally.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,376
This one has... We call
them Kafka breaks.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,421
<i>ETHAN: And actually when we're writing
a script, usually if we haven't gotten</i>

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,342
a Kafka break by page 70, we start
one there just arbitrarily.

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,725
I remember the big dance sequence.
That was fun

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,390
because there were
so many people there.

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,890
<i>JOEL: That was kind of conceived
as a Busby Berkeley number,</i>

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,142
<i>(CHUCKLING)
with Kenny Rogers music.</i>

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,866
<i>I guess the thing that's most reminiscent
of, in terms of the wardrobe,</i>

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,940
is Carmen Miranda with the banana hat,
but in this case it's bowling pins.

18
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,566
We wanted to do a dance number,

19
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,115
you know, a big kind of old
Busby Berkeley styled number

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,615
around the bowling alley,
with sort of icons of bowling.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,744
<i>MOORE: It was hard for me
to even move in that outfit,</i>

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,918
<i>'cause it was kind of made out of
layers of leather and Styrofoam.</i>

23
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,666
<i>It was very, very stiff.</i>

24
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,215
So it was difficult to maneuver. I
guess I had to move around inside it.

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,385
Even doing the stuff with the
bowling ball was challenging.

26
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,137
<i>JOEL: Because the dream follows the
Dude's encounter with a pornographer,</i>

27
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:35,187
<i>it seemed appropriate that it be
a somewhat sexual dream as well.</i>

28
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,061
So Julianne Moore had to wear
the Norse goddess thing.

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,687
With the big breastplates.

30
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,478
<i>ETHAN: The hat with the horns, pigtails.
Trident. JOEL: Yeah.</i>

31
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,731
This was, you have to understand...
Full Brunhilde.

32
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,192
...we're trying to figure out
what the Dude would find erotic.

33
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,204
<i>MOORE: The choreographer was
really rough, very specific.</i>

34
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,674
<i>And I was pregnant, so I was
uncomfortable, really uncomfortable</i>

35
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,166
<i>and kind of nauseous.</i>

36
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,620
And I looked at Joel and Ethan, and
they were like, "Don't worry about it."

37
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,582
And that's what was funny,
they were like, "It's fine."

38
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:07,420
She wanted more mobility in my body, and
I'm like, "I can't move in my outfit."

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,223
<i>JEFF BRIDGES: I loved
dancing, so it was a ball.</i>

40
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,971
Here, generally, I don't like to

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,929
have visitors on the set when I'm
working, 'cause I'm concentrated,

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,638
and I feel like
I've got to be a host,

43
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,476
<i>but I do like to have my family come
to work and see what I'm doing, too.</i>

44
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>So I decided, "Well, this
is like a pretty good day</i>

45
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,022
<i>"for my young daughters
and my wife to come.</i>

46
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,904
"It's a dance number,
it'll be kind of fun."

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,912
And then as I'm getting
ready for the scene,

48
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,117
I say, "Oh, my God. I just realized
what I have to shoot today.

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,047
<i>"I am going to be sailing under
all of these women's legs,</i>

50
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,877
<i>"looking up at their crotches, and
I've invited my wife and my daughters.</i>

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,510
"What an interesting thing
to do. Why did I do that?"

52
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:58,520
So to lighten the moment up, I decided I'm
going to take some photographs of this.

53
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,098
So I have this funny kind
of camera that I use,

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,027
<i>so I go up to the head Bowling
Pin Chorine, as we called them,</i>

55
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,622
Ii said, "This is a good photo op,
do you mind if I take your picture?"

56
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,149
She said, "Oh, by
all means, Dude."

57
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,203
So <i>I get on to my little skate board
to be pulled under their legs,</i>

58
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,202
got my camera and I say,
"Okay, and look up."

59
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,247
<i>And I look up at this lady's
vagina, I guess you could say,</i>

60
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,927
and there's just a jungle of pubic
hair coming out of her outfit.

61
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,051
I mean, it's just a mass, and
before I can register that,

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,555
I'm pulled, and the next one
has even a bigger jungle,

63
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,103
<i>and they're all jungled out
as I'm flying.</i>

64
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:46,811
<i>Just tufts of hair. What they did, thank
God my wife knew about it, you know,</i>

65
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,065
they went to the makeup man and
they had all this crepe hair

66
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,778
(CHUCKLING) shoved into their
tights for the Dude's benefit.

67
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,285
So they pulled one on the old Dude,
but that was fun, I enjoyed that.
