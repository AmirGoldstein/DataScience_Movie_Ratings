683
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:51,012
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

684
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:54,269
Okay. Along comes this kid Janiro,
he don't know any better.

685
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,021
He's a young kid, up-and-coming.
He'll fight anybody.

686
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,398
Good. You fight him.

687
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,731
Bust his hole. Tear him apart. Right?
What are you worried about?

688
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,111
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

689
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,404
The weight? I'm worried
about the weight.

690
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,529
You worried about the weight?

691
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:06,577
What are we arguing about for?

692
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:07,698
I just said the weight.

693
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,826
Okay, let's say you lose
because of your weight,

694
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,828
are they gonna think you're
not as tough as you were?

695
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,956
You're not the same fighter?

696
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:15,707
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

697
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,209
they were afraid of matching
you with before. What happens?

698
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,291
You'll kill them, and they
gotta give you a title shot.

699
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,671
Bring me coffee, please.

700
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:24,800
Why? There's nobody else.
Nobody's left.

701
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,764
Who they gonna give it to?
Coffee.

702
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,261
In a minute.
You listening to me?

703
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:30,013
Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
All right.

704
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,140
How long I gotta wait?

705
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,847
JOEY: Are you listening?

706
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,308
Now, let's say you win,
you beat Janiro,

707
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,392
which you definitely
should beat him.

708
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:39,648
Right? Right?

709
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,853
Yeah. Yeah.

710
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:43,155
They still got to give
you a shot at the title.

711
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:44,698
You know why?
Why?

712
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,071
'Cause the same thing as before.

713
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,947
There's nobody left. There
ain't nobody around.

714
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,325
They gotta give you the shot.
You understand?

715
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,783
If you win, you win. If
you lose, you still win.

716
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,367
There's no way you can lose,

717
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,703
and you do it on your own,
just the way you wanted to do,

718
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,960
without any help from anybody.
You understand?

719
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:02,838
Just get down to 155
pounds, you fat bastard.

720
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:04,714
You stop eating.
What's the problem?

721
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,261
Stop eating, that's all.
You can do it.

722
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,259
You don't understand anything.
You understand that?

723
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,431
VICKIE: You know, Joey's right.

724
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:10,974
This Janiro's
an up-and-coming fighter.

725
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:12,472
He's good-looking, he's popular,

726
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,428
you beat him now...
Excuse me, excuse me,

727
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:15,729
what do you mean good-looking?

728
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,932
I'm not saying good-looking, I'm
saying popular. If you win...

729
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,017
Who are you to say about
good-looking and popular?

730
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,274
I'm not saying anything. I'm
just telling you Joey's right.

731
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:23,820
What are you?
An authority or what?

732
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,773
Nothing.

733
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,201
Get out of here. Take the
baby and get out of here.

734
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,080
Everybody, all of a sudden,
is an authority about this.

735
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,783
Where did she find out he's
good-looking, first of all?

736
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,868
LENORE: She didn't mean nothing.

737
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,422
Who asked you?

738
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,044
You gonna start with me now?

739
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:45,251
When people are talking,
you don't interrupt.

740
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:47,052
It's none of your business,

741
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,054
especially if it's
my brother and his wife.

742
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:50,631
They got nothing to do with you.

743
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:53,058
Now get out of here. Go inside.
Get in and take the baby inside.

744
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:56,809
Come on, let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

745
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,305
Come on.
Change her diapers.

746
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,767
Can't you see? She's gonna... Look,
she's gonna cry. She stinks.

747
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,317
You make her cry.

748
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:03,485
I'm gonna make you cry.

749
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,733
LENORE: Yeah.

750
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,034
They're a couple of babies.

751
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:14,534
JOEY: 155 pounds.
Let's go to the training camp.

752
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,833
No distractions, no wives,
no phone calls,

753
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,284
nobody around to bother you.

754
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,165
All right? Your usual
schedule, your usual diet...

755
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,748
Joey, Joey, listen,
I want to ask you something.

756
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:26,504
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny going on with her?

757
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,336
With who? Vickie?
Yeah.

758
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,795
Like what?

759
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,176
What do you think I mean?

760
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,051
No, I don't notice anything.

761
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,227
I want you to keep an eye on her.
All right?

762
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:39,225
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

763
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:42,274
I want you to keep an eye on
her while I'm away. All right?

764
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:43,567
You'll just start
trouble for nothing.

765
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:44,984
I'm telling you,
you're cracking up.

766
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:46,688
Hey, Joey, I got a
reason, all right?

767
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:49,194
You and I both know any
woman, given the right time,

768
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:52,026
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

769
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,406
I mean, anything's
possible. All right?

770
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:54,658
Yeah.

771
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:56,034
Well, you're right.
Yeah, you know?

772
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,240
You're not wrong, but you're
picking on this girl.

773
00:47:58,335 --> 00:47:59,370
'Cause I saw you before,

774
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,247
you're worried about your weight,
you're getting aggravated,

775
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,705
you tell her... What do you...
"Go inside, go inside.

776
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,085
"Who asked you, who asked you?"

777
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:08,167
Bothering her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

778
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,592
She was talking about a guy.

779
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,885
So?

780
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,054
So what? She was
talking on your behalf.

781
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:15,052
On my behalf? She was
talking about a pretty kid.

782
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,225
She's saying he's good-looking.
What are you talking about?

783
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,053
So you make him ugly.
What's the difference?

784
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,387
Never mind, never mind, just do it.

785
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:22,189
All right.

786
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:26,272
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

787
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:28,070
Make up with her.

788
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,897
Tell her you're gonna take her out.
We'll go out.

789
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,902
You want to go out before
you go away, don't you?

790
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,233
This way you go away
with a clear head.

791
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,821
You know you took her out, you wined
and dined and had a good time.

792
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:38,948
All right?
All right.

793
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,329
Where do you want to go?

794
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,455
Out out, you know.

00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,077
All right.
All right.

796
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,914
Listen, though, don't... If you
tell her now, pull her on the side.

797
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,249
Don't say nothing
in front of Lenore.

798

'Cause I'm not taking her.

799
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,048
It's on your head.
All right.

00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,800

I'm gonna go tell her?

801

00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:32,712
She's with that fucking gorilla.

851
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,957
Must've caught a hundred
beatings off that guy.

852
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,168
(CLEARS THROAT)

853
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:39,883
What took you so long?

854
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,589
I went by Tommy's table
to say hello.

855
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,640
I saw you say hello to him.

856
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:45,764
What took you so long?

857
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,596
Nothing. I said hello.
I came back.

858
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,060
What else did he say?

859
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,516
He asked me if I wanted a drink,

860
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:55,603
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

861
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:58,405
What were you
talking to Sal before?

862
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,732
He asked me if Joey was here.
I said, "He's over there."

863
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:05,116
He said, "Tommy's over there. Why
don't you go say hello?" And I did.

864
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,163
Are you interested in him?

865
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,957
No. Why would I be
interested in him?

866
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,830
You sure you're not
interested in him?

867
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,035
Yeah.

868
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:15,167
In other words, you're
not interested in him

869
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,044
but you could be
interested in somebody?

870
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,172
Jake, don't start, huh?

871
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,048
VICKIE: You're still mad
about some stupid incident?

872
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,050
JAKE: Shut up, or I'm
gonna smack you in the face.

873
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:26,850
These are from Mr. Como.

874
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,099
Shall I take this?

875
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:35,059
What?
Shall I take this?

876
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,064
I'm not through with it.
Okay.

877
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:39,692
<i>These are the jokes, folks.</i>

878
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:40,898
<i>I'll tell you the truth.</i>

879
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,404
<i>Hi. How are you?
Bald-headed fag.</i>

880
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:48,746
Hey, Joey.

881
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,164
Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

882
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,366
How are you, Joey?

883
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:52,496
How are you?

884
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,328
TOMMY: Where's Jake?

885
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,208
He's over there.
He don't wanna come.

886
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,209
Call him. If you call
him, he'll come.

887
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,418
All right.

888
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,927
All right, I'll be right back.
JOEY: Here he comes.

889
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,224
What is it? You don't
call anybody anymore.

890
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,679
We never see you anymore,
for crying out loud.

891
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,356
Yeah, you never come around anymore.
You can't even make a call?

892
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,682
What is it?

893
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:17,518
I'm busy. I'm going away fighting.
I'm busy.

894
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:18,852
I'm out of town a lot.
Busy. Busy. Busy.

895
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:22,360
Look at him, taking me seriously.
I'm only kidding you.

896
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,693
What a fucking kid. That's the
best fucking fighter around.

897
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:26,777
Jake.
How you doing?

898
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,862
The mulignanes, forget about it,

899
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,038
they're all afraid to fight you.

900
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,160
Okay.

901
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,249
How you feeling? All right?
I'm all right.

902
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:34,622
Good? Strong?

903
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:35,828
Strong. Yeah, I'm doing okay.

904
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:39,005
That Janiro's got to
watch his ass, right?

905
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:41,083
I think he should.

906
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:43,339
Last three, four times, I won
nothing but money with the guy.

907
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,341
Well, he's no piece of cake.
That's a good fighter.

908
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,969
SAL: Very attractive guy,
all the girls like him.

909
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,515
No marks. Clean.

910
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,850
Jake, am I wrong or did
you gain a few pounds?

911
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:57,524
Yeah, a few pounds. I'll knock
it off right away. No problem.

912
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,393
Right off, right off.

913
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,396
Well, look, let me ask
you something.

914
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,152
I'm just talking,
now, just talking.

915
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,405
I come to you and I'm telling you

916
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,202
that I'm gonna bet
a lot of money on you

917
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,200
in this fight with Janiro, right?

918
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,907
Yeah.

919
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:16,665
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

920
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:19,122
I would say bet everything you got.

921
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,250
Everything?

922
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,923
Everything.

923
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,592
'Cause I'm going to
open his hole like this.

924
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,669
Excuse my French, girls.

925
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:29,591
I'm gonna make him suffer.

926
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:32,972
I'm gonna make his mother
wish she never had him.

927
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,682
There something personal?
Make him look like dog meat.

928
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,646
What? Did he say
something in the papers?

929
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:39,976
No, he's a nice kid.
He's a pretty kid, too.

930
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,605
I mean, I don't know,
I got a problem with

931
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,232
if I should I fuck
him or fight him?

932
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:48,450
Crazy. Fuck him or fight him.

933
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,277
You're really liable to
get fucked with this kid.

934
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:51,611
Watch out.

935
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:53,447
By who?
SAL: Janiro.

936
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,623
You mean, you want me
to get him to fuck you?

937
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,122
Me? No, I don't want him to fuck me.
Yeah.

938
00:54:58,213 --> 00:54:59,248
I could do that easily.

939
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,420
SAL: How you gonna do that?

940
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:01,622
'Cause I get you both in the ring,

941
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,002
and I'll give you
both a fucking beating,

942
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,504
and you both can fuck each other.

943
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,177
I'll get all full of blood.

944
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,845
You're used to that.

945
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,554
TOMMY: Come on, drink up. That's
ginger ale, Jake. Come on.

946
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,598
Jake, good luck.

947
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:18,054
Good luck, Jake.

948

949
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,097
Vickie.

950
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,307
What?
You awake?

951
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:04,856
No.

952
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,859
Can you hear me?

953
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,440
What?

954
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:18,073
You ever think of anybody else

955
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,288
when we're in bed?

956
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:23,545
What do you mean?

957
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,292
You know, like, when we make love.

958
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,133
Nobody. I love you.

959
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,967
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

960
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:34,722
What did I say?

961
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,050
You said he had a pretty face.

962
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:39,970
I never noticed his face.

963
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:43,474
Well, how come you
said that, then?

964
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:45,897
I don't even know what I said.

965
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:48,103
I don't even know
what he looks like.

966
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,651
Go to sleep.

967
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,015

968
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,566

Fucking hard-on.

Four pounds.

Keep working.
Cut the bullshit.

977
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,704
Joey, I saw him fight with
Janiro, I couldn't believe it.

978
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:13,039
He destroyed this guy. It
was absolutely incredible.

979
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:16,001
He knocked his nose from one
side of his face to the other.

980
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,177
Fucking thing was hanging off.

981

982
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,014
Will you tell me who
you're gonna fight next?

983
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,182
We never talked about it... You
know he's away at training camp.

984
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:25,806
From all I've seen, they gotta
give him that title shot.

985
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:27,763
Jackie Curtie, Joey.
You should know each other.

986
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:30,440
Hi, Joey, pleasure. Heard a
lot of nice things about you.

987
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:32,187
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

988
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,690
I'm sure. Man, I like your brother.
Made lot of money on him.

989
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:36,567
Yeah, probably more than
he did, that's for sure.

990

on the Oscar Jackson fight.

Ever see him anymore or...

992
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,655
He's punchy. He probably died.
Who the fuck cares?

993
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,615
Make yourselves comfortable.
That's a beautiful table.

994
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,245
Worst table in the house.
And he's complaining to me.

995
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:49,371
It's a beautiful table.

996
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:52,250
JACKIE: He's working downtown, big building.
Works in the elevator.

997
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,001
Happened to be there the other day.

998
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,049
I'm not Italian.
I don't care.

999
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,296
Took me right up.

1000
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:58,501
That Oscar's always a stand-up guy.

1001
00:59:58,638 --> 00:59:59,753
Joey, he did you a lot of good.
Who's talking?

1002
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,588
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

1006

Come on back. Okay.

VICKIE: I'm just sitting
there ordering a drink.

1012
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:24,778
Shut up. Just shut up.

1013
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:25,953
Both of you are the same.
You know that?

1014
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,451
I feel like I'm a prisoner.
I can't walk.

1015
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:30,455
I look at somebody the
wrong way, I get smacked.

1016
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:31,626
You think you're
right or something,

1017
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:32,747
the way you're fucking yelling?

1018
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,245
Yeah, I am right. You're wrong.
No, you're wrong.

1019
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,126
Look, I am right. I'm tired
of having to turn around,

Jake, how are you? Good, Charlie.
Good to see you.

1351

Lots of luck.
Thank you.

1353
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,139
I'm feeling all right,
Tommy. Thank you.

1354
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,220
Are you feeling good?

1355
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:09,646
I'm feeling as good
as I'm gonna feel.

1356
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:11,895
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1357
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:15,228
All right. Now, we just came by

No.

1360

No. No thank you, Tommy.

1361
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,117
All right. Take care.
Good luck. God bless you.

1362
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:23,410
All right, Tommy, thank you.

1363
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,283
You'll be all right.
Yeah, I will.

1364
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,952
See you later, everybody.

appreciate your coming.

You know that.

1368

It was really nice of you, you know?
And we really appreciate it.

very important to him.

1371
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:38,751
Anytime.

1372
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:39,880
I just want to say goodbye.

1373
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:40,927
So long, honey.

1374

care of that guy, all right?

1375

VICKIE: I'll take care of him.

1376
01:16:44,226 --> 01:16:45,933
Joey, any little thing,
I want you to call me.

1377
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:49,353
He's very nervous? Ka-boom, call.
Goodbye, honey.

1378
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:52,731
Would you look at
that face? What a face.

1379
01:16:52,818 --> 01:16:54,604
Can you believe that girl, huh?

1380
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,026

as beautiful as ever.

So long, everybody.

1384
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,737
So long, Tommy.

1386
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:12,375
Vickie.

1387
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,045
Hey, come here.

1388
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:16,873
Come here a minute.

1389
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:25,802

1390
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:26,973
All what?

1391
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,644

1392

What happened?

1393
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,022
I don't know.
I just said goodbye.

1394
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:36,146
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him.

1395
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,647
I just said goodbye. What
do you want me to do?

1396
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:40,320
You don't do that. You say hello. You say goodbye.
That's all, you hear?

1397
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:41,738
Whatever.

ever have any disrespect for me.

You hear what I said?
You hear what I said?

1400
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,405
Yeah, I hear.

1401
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,081
All right, go in there.

1402

you stop that, huh?

Stop it!

When you gave him a beating.

1470

You mean, when I caught his head in
the taxicab door, was banging it,

1471
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:53,519
and smacked him with
a glass and everything?

told me about it?

to do with you.

1482
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:17,212
Had nothing to do with me? No.

you to keep an eye on her?

1513
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:22,483
And I did keep an eye
on her. Yes, I did.

1514
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:23,908

gave him a beating?

1515

Hey, I'm your brother. You're
supposed to believe me.

1522

Don't you trust me?
No, I don't.

That's nice.

Tell me what happened.

1527
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:46,715
I told you exactly what happened.

1528
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:49,600
He got out of line,
I slapped him around,

1529
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:52,896
Tommy straightened it all
out, and it's all over.

1530
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:00,153
You give me that look, Joey.

1531
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:05,404
I got to accept
your answer, you know,

1532
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,910
but I'm telling you now,
if I hear anything,

1533
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,910
I swear on our mother
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1534
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:13,200
I'm gonna kill somebody, Joey.

1535
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,456
Well, go ahead and kill everybody!
You're the tough guy.

1536
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:17,412
Go kill people.
Kill Vickie.

1537
01:26:17,507 --> 01:26:21,171
Kill Salvy. Kill Tommy Como. Kill me
while you're at it. What do I care?

1538

What do you mean? I don't understand.
What do you mean, kill you? You?

1541

Me! Kill me! Start here!
Kill me first.

Do me a fucking favor! 'Cause
you're driving me crazy!

You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill. You're a killer.

1544
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:39,768
Excuse me, what do you
mean by "you," though?

1545
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:42,229
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothing.

1546
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:45,190
Even you don't know
what you meant by "you."

1547
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,366
Don't mean nothing.

1548
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,692
Joey, that meant something.

1549
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:50,028
You mentioned Tommy, you mentioned
Salvy, you mentioned you.

1550
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:52,364
You included you with them.

1551
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:55,826
You could've said anybody,
but you said you and them.

ruin your life. Look at you.

What?

You fucked my wife?

1557
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,720
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1558
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:15,475
How could you ask me? I'm your brother.
You ask me that?

1559
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:20,351

big enough to ask me that?

1560

Just tell me.

answer that. It's stupid.

ain't giving me the right answer.

1564

I'm not gonna answer.

that I'm gonna answer it.

Come on. Be friends.
Come on, you're my brother.

Be friends.
My brother?

Yeah, you fucking burn.
Give me a break.

Come on.

Wait. Let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

You're gonna forgive and forget? It's
a long time ago. Forget about it.

Good.

Everything's all right?

2089

You don't want to do
this here. Come on.

Let me call you. We'll get
together in a couple days.

2091

You'll call me?
I will.

2092

Don't forget.

2093
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:55,579

Some people aren't that lucky.

2097
02:01:20,024 --> 02:01:23,858
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront,

2098
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:26,527
an up-and-comer who's
now a down-and-outer.

2099
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:28,446
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

2100
02:01:28,532 --> 02:01:30,990
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

2101
02:01:31,076 --> 02:01:33,408
And it went something like this.

2102
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:39,199
It wasn't him, Charley.
It was you.

2103
02:01:39,877 --> 02:01:42,460
You remember that night at the Garden,
you came down to my dressing room,

2104
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:47,086
and you said, "Kid, this ain't your night.
We're going for the price on Wilson?"

2105
02:01:47,176 --> 02:01:49,838
Remember that? "This
ain't your night."

2106
02:01:49,929 --> 02:01:51,670
My night.

2107
02:01:51,764 --> 02:01:54,426
I could've taken Wilson
apart that night.

2108
02:01:54,517 --> 02:01:56,007
So what happens?

2109
02:01:56,101 --> 02:01:59,184
He gets a title shot outdoors in
a ballpark, and what do I get?

2110
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:01,729
A one-way ticket to Palookaville.

2111
02:02:01,816 --> 02:02:04,808
I was never no good after
that night, Charley.

2112
02:02:04,902 --> 02:02:08,645
It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

2113
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,485
It was you, Charley.

2114
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,950
You was my brother.

2115
02:02:15,037 --> 02:02:18,075
You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

2116
02:02:18,165 --> 02:02:20,782
You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

2117
02:02:20,876 --> 02:02:24,335
You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

2118
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:28,415
instead of making me take them
dives for the short-end money.

2119
02:02:28,509 --> 02:02:30,341
You don't understand.

2120
02:02:31,053 --> 02:02:34,842
I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

2121
02:02:34,932 --> 02:02:39,677
I could've been somebody, instead
of a bum, which is what I am.

2122
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:42,728
Let's face it.
It was you, Charley.

(DOOR OPENS)

2124
02:02:44,817 --> 02:02:45,807
It was you, Charley.

02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:47,642
How you doing, Jake?

2126
02:02:47,736 --> 02:02:48,692
Everything all right?

2127
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:49,940
Yeah.

Ready? It'll be about five minutes.

2129
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,897
Okay.

2130
02:02:52,992 --> 02:02:54,403
Need anything?
No.

2131
02:02:54,493 --> 02:02:55,824
You sure?

2132
02:02:56,662 --> 02:02:57,948
I'm sure.

2133
02:03:02,293 --> 02:03:03,829
Lot of people out there?

2134
02:03:03,919 --> 02:03:05,626
Yeah.
It's crowded.
