1
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,121
Yeah, you can leave her
in the hallway for now.

2
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,087
Stabilizing here.
Where's the portable x-ray?

3
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,834
Check,
charge or cash?

4
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,711
Cash. And...

5
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,841
...make it out
to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

6
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,469
Seven eighty-eight thirty.

7
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,979
Okay.

8
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,245
Hey.

9
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,122
Taking me to breakfast?

10
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,874
I can't, I'm meeting Bosko.

11
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,085
Hey, Vincent.

12
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,338
Mom, where are my barrettes?
Hi, sweetie.

13
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,924
I saw them on the kitchen table.
They're not there. I already checked.

14
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,302
Want me to make coffee?
No school today?

15
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,722
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

16
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,099
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

17
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,896
He's already a half an hour late.

18
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,275
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,070
I'll make coffee.
I'm out of time, babe.

20
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,752
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not in the couch.

21
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,380
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,174
I don't wanna wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,010
Did you check in your bathroom?
I checked everywhere.

24
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,888
Well, what do you want me to do?
Find them.

25
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,974
Mom, pay attention.
All right, sweetie, all right. What?

26
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,102
Daddy's gonna be here.
Okay, he's gonna-

27
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,187
I'm not gonna be ready. I can't be late.

28
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,523
You won't be late.
No, I will be late.

29
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,651
Okay. Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

30
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,861
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
No.

31
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,655
It's all right. It's all right.

32
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,741
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together.

33
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,621
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

34
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,675
Hey. Give me another refill.

35
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,929
Now he wants a refill.

36
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,940
What's your name?
Waingro.

37
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,992
You're Michael?

38
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,048
You guys always work together?

39
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,884
All the time.

40
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,595
Real tight crew?
Real tight.

41
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,558
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

42
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,227
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

43
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,116
How's he doing?
A hundred percent.

44
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,202
Right on schedule.

45
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,078
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

46
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,667
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.
Okay.</i>

47
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,777
Just crossed over the number-one lane,
300 yards from you now.

48
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,363
Get set.
I am.

49
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,656
Put that on.

50
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,623
Here we go.

51
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,186
Two eleven! Two eleven!
We're being held up!

52
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,278
<i>Two-eleven alarm. Armored car.</i>

53
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,363
There's the call. Three minutes.

54
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,617
Clear!

55
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,057
Eighty seconds left!

56
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,103
Get back. Get back.

57
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,688
Get back!

58
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,067
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

59
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,778
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

60
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,625
I got it.

61
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,419
Got it.

62
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,173
You had to fuck with me.

63
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,092
You wanna fuck with me?

64
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,993
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,745
What did you do?
I had to, man.

66
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,080
Guy was making a move.
Let's go.

67
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,548
Dumb motherfucker.

68
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,580
Step back, please, sir.
I heard them.

69
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,189
A million six.

70
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,234
Forty cents on the dollar,
640,000 to you.

71
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,778
Here's a 150 front money.

72
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,239
Get you the rest in two, three days.

73
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,575
Know who owned these?

74
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,081
"Malibu Equity and Investments. "

75
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,252
Roger Van Zant.
Owns banks in the Caymans.

76
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,922
Runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

77
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,425
So?
So you ripped off his bearer bonds.

78
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,761
He's got insurance.

79
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,764
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

80
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,768
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60 percent of their value.

81
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,938
And make 40 percent
on top of the 100 percent.

82
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,735
Sell it back to him instead of going to
the street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.

83
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,612
Try it on him.

84
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,156
Kelso called.
About what?

85
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,909
A score he's putting out
and wants you to look at.

86
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,662
What do I need his score for?
I got my own.

87
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,956
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

88
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,126
Nine a. m. tomorrow.
What happened out there?

89
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,504
Don't ask.

90
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,373
Find the ambulance?

91
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,085
Dumped it four blocks from here.
22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

92
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,631
They torched it. Burned everything.
The guns, clothes, everything.

93
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,008
Investigators are still working the scene...

94
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,427
They were airborne.
Taped the last few seconds...

95
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,846
...of the black-and-whites
doing demolition derby.

96
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,892
Stolen out of Fresno
two weeks ago.

97
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,686
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
day before yesterday.

98
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,816
You taking this one, lieutenant,
or does it stay in Division?

99
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,862
This look like gangbangers
working the local 7-Eleven to you?

100
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,448
Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah.
All yours.

101
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,118
We got three motorists. All they saw
were men with masks. They were distant.

102
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,206
Console TV man over there however,
he was closer.

103
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,333
He ID anybody?

104
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,544
Well, he was hiding. He heard it mostly.

105
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,382
Okay. What about them?

106
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,219
Right. Now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

107
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,763
Smart.
Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick. "

108
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,390
Slick?
Yeah.

109
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:21,062
Now, this guy- I figure this guy went
for that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?

110
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,647
From here.

111
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,483
Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

112
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,235
To his side.

113
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,281
This guy here has got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

114
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,243
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

115
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,869
Probably executed.

116
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:43,084
And it was a million six in bearer bonds,
and they ignored the loose cash.

117
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,962
Because they had no time,
because they were on a clock.

118
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,923
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

119
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,301
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

120
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,887
...escaped in under three minutes.

121
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,682
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

122
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,437
Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.
Traffic video camera?

123
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,605
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

124
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,274
You recognize the M.O.?

125
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,193
M.O. is that they're good.

126
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,196
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef
for all of them...

127
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,450
...after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate...

128
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:19,495
...popped guard number three
because what difference does it make?

129
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,414
Why leave a living witness?

130
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,876
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock 'n' roll.

131
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,297
The shape charge.

132
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,217
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

133
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,303
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

134
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,098
So let's start looking for recent
high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

135
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,434
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBl.

136
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,770
You're gonna get the phone book.
Do it anyway.

137
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,939
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

138
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,651
Check the usual fences.
You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

139
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,530
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.
Hang in with Forensics.

140
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,492
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

141
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,578
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

142
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,415
Get your hand out of that man's pocket,
Rachel.

143
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,666
Oh, Vince.

144
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,967
Want some pie?

145
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,270
Gotta go to the john.

146
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,721
Look, I had to get it on, man.
He was making a move. I had to get it on.

147
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,905
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

148
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,908
...to make up for his full end.

149
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,579
Because I wanna pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

150
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,746
Okay.

151
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,037
Hold it!

152
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,758
Hey.

153
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,847
Where's the rest?
We're late.

154
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,059
You look too good to go out.
I could just jump you right here.

155
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,732
Where is it?
Squared the bookies, baby.

156
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,319
There's more in a couple days,
so don't sweat it. We really are late.

157
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,613
Yeah, come on,
you gotta be kidding me.

158
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,118
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take
for 8000.

159
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,121
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

160
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,623
Let's go. Get your coat.

161
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,046
There is no point talking to you.
All you are is a child growing older.

162
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,547
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,885
It means we're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

164
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,304
I'm married to a gambling junkie
who won't listen.

165
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,139
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

166
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,226
What am I doing
in this rat-bastard situation?

167
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,730
You're not! What do you want from me?
Leave the bankbook and car keys...

168
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,108
...in the kitchen on your way out.
Are we going, or am I going alone?

169
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,778
You could keep that other crap
but Dominick would go with me.

170
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,490
Don't you even think about-

171
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,600
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

172
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,979
Albert Torena call Vincent?
No.

173
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,482
No. Report came in.

174
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,819
The explosive was Dynex,
linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

175
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,989
You can pick it up with a driver's license
in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

176
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:33,494
Too common to trace a sale, Vincent.
Oh, that's wonderful.

177
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,640
Are you all right?

178
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,351
What happened? Where you been?

179
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,686
Work.

180
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,148
Lauren's dad show up?

181
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:07,903
Didn't call, didn't show.
We waited for you till 10:30.

182
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,242
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

183
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,829
I don't know.

184
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,873
Fucking jerk.

185
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,876
Well, is she okay?

186
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,879
She's been in her room all day.

187
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,215
So no, she's not okay.
Neither am I.

188
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:33,637
I made dinner for us,
four hours ago-

189
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:38,851
Every time I try to maintain a
consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

190
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:45,566
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

191
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,401
I'm sorry...

192
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,739
...if the goddamn chicken...

193
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,533
...got overcooked.

194
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,553
<i>- seven men in Denmark,
to a key defendant here.</i>

195
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,267
Did you find it?
Not yet.

196
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,645
There it is.

197
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,690
It's over here, somewhere.

198
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,615
Interior design?
It's on the back wall.

199
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,259
Coffee, sir?
Please.

200
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,391
Will you pass the cream?

201
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,812
Thanks.
What did you get?

202
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,898
What?

203
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,317
What are you reading?

204
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,991
Book about metals.

205
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,039
<i>"Stress Fractures in Titanium. "</i>

206
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,959
What kind of work you do?

207
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,340
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

208
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,513
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

209
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,098
What store?

210
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,142
Hennessey + Ingalls. I work there.

211
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:49,857
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

212
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,746
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

213
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:08,375
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.
My name's Neil.

214
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,007
I'm Eady.

215
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,178
You like working there?

216
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,097
Sure.

217
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,476
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

218
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,686
What area's that?

219
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,813
Graphic design.

220
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,776
I do, letterheads
and logotypes at night...

221
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,779
...and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

222
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,989
Who do you do that for?

223
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,410
A restaurant.

224
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,455
I did their menus, and...

225
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,876
...a small, record label.

226
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,631
CDs. I've done two so far.

227
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,385
You go to school for that?

228
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,969
Heh, yeah.

229
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,431
Yeah, I went to Parsons.
Where's that?

230
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,641
New York City.

231
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,143
How long you been out here?

232
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,271
About a year.

233
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,774
You like it?
Ha, ha.

234
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,986
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

235
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,371
Live in this neighborhood?
Ah, no...

236
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,457
...I live, kind of above Sunset Plaza.

237
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,128
It's actually kind of-
It's a little house that I rent.

238
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,799
And it's just kind of run-down,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

239
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,551
What about you?

240
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,304
I live up here.
That's very funny.

241
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,686
So where's your family from originally?

242
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,898
I'm Scotch-Irish.

243
00:28:55,358 --> 00:29:01,530
They, emigrated to Appalachia
in the late 1700s.

244
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,158
Where are you from?

245
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,493
The Bay Area.

246
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,288
Are your folks there?

247
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:16,003
my mother died a long time ago,
and my father, I don't know where he is.

248
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,713
Got a brother somewhere.

249
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,013
You have a tight family. I can tell.

250
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,015
Yep.
Right?

251
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,017
You're right.

252
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,734
Yeah...

253
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,487
City of lights.

254
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:50,454
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae.
They come out once a year in the water.

255
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,415
That's what it looks like out there.

256
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,418
You been there?

257
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,879
No, I'm going there someday.

258
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,340
Oh, yeah?

259
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,181
You travel a lot?

260
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,312
Yeah.
Traveling makes you lonely?

261
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,613
I- I'm alone. I am not lonely.

262
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,490
You?

263
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,409
I get lonely.

264
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,577
Albert!

265
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,539
Shit.
Albert.

266
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,667
Vincent, what you doing
coming here, man?

267
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,210
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

268
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:48,006
You were supposed to get back to me
last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

269
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,260
I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know.
Let's violate his ass right now.

270
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,556
I do for you, you don't do for me,
is that it?

271
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,559
Vincent, man, I swear,
I was out all night, man.

272
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,062
I'm hitting like one of them
flamingo-matador guys.

273
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,356
Flamingo?
That's got nothing to do with me.

274
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,943
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

275
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,487
I'm a dancer, man. You know.
Bullshit.

276
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,073
I paged your ass all day.
I can't stand paging.

277
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,826
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

278
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,912
Where is your empathy, brother?
It's a substance-abuse problem.

279
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,372
Empathy was yesterday.

280
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,499
Today you're wasting
my motherfucking time.

281
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,835
Vincent, man, look-
Did you fall in love?

282
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,422
Come on. Did you fall in love last night
and you went off somewhere?

283
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,924
Vincent-
Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

284
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,760
I'll buy that.
Vincent.

285
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,053
Give me all you got!

286
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,222
Vincent-
Give me all you got!

287
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,226
I swear, man, my brother, man-
My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

288
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,103
I heard "Richard"?

289
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,397
He's gonna talk to you.
Richard?

290
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,898
Richard.
Richard.

291
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,110
He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight.
He's not here, is he?

292
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,613
No, he's gonna meet you tonight.
Tonight? What happened to now?

293
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,576
I- I- I implored him
because I knew you was coming this a. m.

294
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,870
This is a bunch of bullshit.
No, no, I swear.

295
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,748
He said no because he in Phoenix.

296
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,624
But this, man, I swear- I swear, man-

297
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,376
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

298
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,129
<i>He'll be risin'</i>

299
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,383
<i>He'll probably leave a note
Right on the door</i>

300
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,761
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

301
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:22,059
You know?
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

302
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,561
...at 2 a. m. Be there.

303
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,146
You be there too.

304
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,191
Vincent, I can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vincent.

305
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,819
I got things to do, places to be. I got-
Hey, hey, hey.

306
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,155
Be there.

307
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,872
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

308
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,877
What is it?

309
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,671
It's a bank.

310
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,133
It depos cash on Thursday
for distribution to all the other branches...

311
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,344
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

312
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,680
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

313
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,517
On the prowl or strong?
Strong. Through the front door.

314
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,519
How many guys?

315
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,688
Four, or three plus a driver.
Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

316
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,232
And you want a 100,000 advance...

317
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,692
...against a 10-percent cut for that?

318
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,154
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.
They hit the holdup alarms...

319
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,032
...I gotta get out before the cops show.
What is that?

320
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,576
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

321
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,870
Two telco and a cellular.

322
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,667
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because...

323
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:34,673
See, the night before, you cut in
and trick out the alarm-system computer...

324
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:40,428
...to turn itself and the video recorders off
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

325
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,140
Architectural,
electrical-engineering plans?

326
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,561
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards
already built. They go straight into the CPU.

327
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,564
What's the estimate?

328
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,528
Twelve-point-one-, 12.2 million.

329
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,532
You're on.

330
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,742
Congratulations.

331
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,872
And to give you a little idea of where my
estimates come from, this is a printout...

332
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,457
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

333
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,128
Be that as it may, my way you get
100 percent from the insurance company...

334
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,964
...and take the bonds from us
at 60 cents on the dollar...

335
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,216
<i>...and make yourself another 40 percent.</i>

336
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,762
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

337
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,432
Sure, you got a deal.

338
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,311
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

339
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,106
Yeah, so you have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

340
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,649
Yeah, okay.

341
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,484
Nice talking to you.

342
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,112
You gonna deal with these guys?

343
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,282
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

344
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,118
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

345
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,580
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

346
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,046
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

347
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,507
I have a printout of the, cash flow
of the bank for the past two months.

348
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,302
How'd you get this information?
Just comes to you.

349
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,304
This stuff just flies through the air.

350
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,474
They send information out
and it's beamed out all over the place.

351
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,977
All you have to do is know how to grab it.
See, I know how to grab it.

352
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,946
Okay, here we go.
Thirteen-point-nine million.

353
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,575
I bought it.
Good.

354
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,535
What did I tell you?

355
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,415
Here.

356
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,836
We're on.
Call Van Zant, collect the money.

357
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,924
How is he?
He's a businessman.

358
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,885
Okay.

359
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,248
Avocado.
"Avocado. "

360
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,419
Hello?
Yeah, hello.

361
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,879
Chris is at my place.

362
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,678
What's wrong?
Husband-and-wife stuff.

363
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,723
I'll let him sleep it off here.

364
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,280
What happened to you?

365
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:53,079
When you gonna get some furniture?
When I get around to it.

366
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,792
Charlene's gonna leave me.

367
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,338
Why?

368
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,092
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

369
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,346
With everything we've been doing?

370
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,350
Vegas and the Super Bowl
cleaned me out.

371
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,937
When you gonna get an old lady?
When I get around to it.

372
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,983
You got something else on the side?

373
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,944
Nothing regular.

374
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,947
She got something else on the side?

375
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,449
No.
You sure?

376
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,619
Yeah, I'm sure.

377
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,498
I don't know what you're doing.

378
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,876
Remember Jimmy MacAwain
on the yard used to say:

379
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,961
"You wanna be making moves
on the street?

380
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,131
Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

381
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,717
...that you cannot walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

382
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,345
...if you spot the heat
around the corner. "

383
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,055
Remember that?

384
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,815
For me,
the sun rises and sets with her, man.

385
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,234
Yeah?

386
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,945
Yeah.

387
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,782
Okay.

388
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,997
Today we take delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

389
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,209
...then I drop our deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

390
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,669
Bank? What bank?

391
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,839
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

392
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,007
That goes too, then the bank.

393
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,764
You want some breakfast?
Yeah.

394
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,689
Are you okay?

395
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,941
Yeah, sugar.

396
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,364
Yeah.

397
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,782
For real.
Okay.

398
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,992
Gonna do good.

399
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,202
I'll see you later.

400
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,512
You Solenko?
I'm Don Breedan.

401
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,808
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come by here and see if you had a job for me.

402
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,896
You're familiar with this kind of operation?
Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.

403
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,399
Good. Good for you. Here,
you'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher...

404
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,568
...bus tables and empty the garbage too.

405
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,654
Give me a hard time,
I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.

406
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,407
And I will violate you back so fast
your head will spin.

407
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,076
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

408
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,747
Rules of the game.
Call Grierson, check it out.

409
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,832
Change in the back.

410
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,256
Well, what are you waiting for?

411
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,027
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

412
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,197
<i>Yeah, Roger Van Zant.
Please hold.</i>

413
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,161
<i>Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.</i>

414
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,871
I'm supposed to collect something.

415
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,292
Give me your number, and somebody
will call you right back from a different line.

416
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,463
818-133-6089.

417
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,071
Yep.

418
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,990
<i>I got a package for you.</i>

419
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,200
<i>There's a drive-in on Centinela.
Two-thirty tomorrow.</i>

420
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,911
Okay, just send one man, alone.

421
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,771
Who was that guy?
Nobody.

422
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,524
Who the-? Who-? Who was that guy?

423
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,193
He's nobody.
I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

424
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,862
He's nobody, Neil.
Listen, you-

425
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,531
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas.

426
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,367
Alan Marciano.
Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.

427
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,329
It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it!
Shut up!

428
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,833
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

429
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:53,212
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

430
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,465
...on my own, anywhere you want.

431
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,635
Dominick will go with you.
And my word counts.

432
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,972
But right now,
you will give him the chance.

433
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,561
Clean up. Go home.

434
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,648
Clean up. Go home.

435
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,277
Give me all your money.

436
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,738
One day you gonna get smoked
with that shit.

437
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,073
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

438
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,079
He's coming in alone. Send him through.
Yeah, got it.

439
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,500
<i>On a fist full a nothin',
Meanwhile I'll be puffin'</i>

440
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,419
<i>On a fat blunt, run punk,
You don't know the half</i>

441
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,629
<i>Tryin' to talk shit, man,
Please don't make me laugh</i>

442
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,798
<i>These Irish eyes are smilin',
I'm buckwildin'</i>

443
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,883
<i>The House Of Pain is pumpin'
Start jumpin'</i>

444
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,094
<i>Freak it, funk it, back seat junk it</i>

445
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,263
<i>If you can't get with it
You'll wind up sweatin' it</i>

446
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,390
<i>Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg</i>

447
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,517
<i>It's so hard to run
When you got a broken leg</i>

448
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,980
<i>We got the cake
That you're tryin' to get a crumb off</i>

449
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,107
<i>The Irish style, the Celtic jazz</i>

450
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,817
<i>No one has it, just us
That's it</i>

451
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,194
Vincent, hey, man.

452
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,158
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard.
Richard, Vincent.

453
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,744
Richard.
Yo, it's all right.

454
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,121
What have you got for me?

455
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,165
Before we even get into that...

456
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:56,502
...there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas, all right?

457
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,046
Now, the back of a trim shop on Irvine...

458
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,300
...if somebody was to pay a little visit
this weekend...

459
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,345
...they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

460
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,182
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

461
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,101
I'm a good citizen.

462
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,022
I'm Donald Duck.
So you got something to tell me or what?

463
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,067
Check this out, coz.

464
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,863
How do I know
if I tell you what you need to know...

465
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,532
...you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done?

466
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,453
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man.
We do business all the time.

467
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,914
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

468
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:38,711
And you know because I say so
after I hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.

469
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,297
Look here, man.
You understand what I'm saying?

470
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,466
I can get killed for telling you this shit.

471
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,760
Or you're gonna get killed
walking your doggie.

472
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,762
All right.

473
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,223
There's this cat I was
locked up with in Folsom.

474
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,644
Did a couple, two, three years.
He got out and I ran into him.

475
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,106
And so?

476
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,692
He's a big fiend for action.

477
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,363
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing...

478
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,242
...but he goes on and on, running down
to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

479
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,078
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

480
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:18,251
So right then and there I know
this cat's got something going down.

481
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,717
Pretty fucking great.

482
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,763
Albert, what's wrong with you?

483
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,642
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

484
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,979
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

485
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:42,900
That's right.
Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

486
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,444
What do you want for that,
a Junior G-man badge?

487
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,947
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

488
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,283
Is he kidding me?

489
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,912
I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

490
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,581
You know what I'm saying?

491
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,499
Say what? Say what?
What?

492
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:03,588
You said, "Slick. " What does that mean?
Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick. "

493
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,049
And tell me about him.

494
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:12,680
About 6 feet tall, lot of jailhouse tats.

495
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,141
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

496
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,437
What's his name?

497
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,814
Cheritto.

498
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,984
Michael Cheritto.

499
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,489
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

500
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,159
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.</i>

501
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,121
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef
in Attica. Three years in Marion.

502
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,750
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

503
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,752
<i>Jacket's 2 inches thick.
Okay.</i>

504
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,838
Who do I have there now?
Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.

505
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,840
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

506
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,843
That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

507
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,097
We never close. Open seven days a week.
Bug the car, the house, the work.

508
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,350
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...</i>

509
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,810
<i>...I want pictures
of who he moves and sits with.</i>

510
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,856
Then run makes on them. They got jackets,
I wanna see who they move and sit with.

511
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,525
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

512
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,083
Put your hands where I can see them.
What?

513
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,253
Put your hands where I can see them.
All right.

514
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,048
I tell you what to do,
I tell you how to do it.

515
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,761
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

516
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,432
...take the package and throw it in here.

517
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,951
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

518
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,241
Unh!

519
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,616
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

520
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,744
Yeah, who's this?
You know who this is.

521
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,288
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

522
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:11,043
I sent a guy to deliver the package.
He didn't call. Is everything right?

523
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,338
<i>Tell you what, forget the money.</i>

524
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:18,384
What?
Forget the money.

525
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,261
Wh-

526
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,515
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

527
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,560
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone-

528
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,395
I don't understand.

529
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,232
- because there is a dead man
on the other end of this fucking line.

530
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,753
Oh, my.

531
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,256
Do you like it?
Look at my ring.

532
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,842
Wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

533
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,764
Did you know about this?
It's so beautiful.

534
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,600
You are insane.

535
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,731
Do you like it?

536
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,774
It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's pretty good.

537
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,278
Just don't ask him where he got it.
Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha-ha.

538
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,996
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, honey?

539
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,373
I don't know.

540
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,545
She doesn't know.
Just like me. I don't know either.

541
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,478
Hello?

542
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,563
Hi, it's me.

543
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,484
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

544
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,571
I've been busy. Can I see you?

545
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:07,743
I was afraid that was just
the one night, you know?

546
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,829
No, not for me, it wasn't.

547
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,917
Yeah, me neither.

548
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,337
Can I fall by?

549
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,675
Yeah.
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

550
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,853
Thank you.

551
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,356
Good night.
Ha-ha-ha.

552
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,900
Goddamn convention.

553
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,153
Which one's Slick?
The wide one.

554
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,530
Got two transmitters.

555
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,741
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

556
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,368
Okay, get ready.

557
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,745
Did you say good night to Neil?
Good night.

558
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,541
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis.
SIS has got a revolving tail...

559
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,501
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

560
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,048
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

561
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:06,093
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

562
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,221
Sammy and I think that's gonna
be their next score.

563
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,390
Who's the loner?

564
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:17,396
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

565
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,066
Well, get on it.

566
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,327
Okay.

567
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,548
When these guys walk out the door
of whatever score they're gonna take next...

568
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,594
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

569
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,362
Hey, baby. Time to go.

570
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,531
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

571
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,742
Oh, yeah.

572
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,205
You fly. You cool.

573
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,549
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

574
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,720
I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

575
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,473
A regular rodeo rider.

576
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,018
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

577
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,733
Now I got to get my ass
street side, sugar.

578
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,194
You don't have a truth-telling style.

579
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,907
What are you talking about?
You don't know what this is.

580
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,874
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

581
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,636
Unh!

582
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,978
Where you been?

583
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,189
SHU at Pelican Bay.

584
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,733
New Folsom, B-wing.

585
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:31,113
I am a cowboy
looking for anything heavy.

586
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,991
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

587
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,535
That is why I am here.

588
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,793
Why don't you-?

589
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,505
Why don't you call this guy?

590
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,341
This guy's always putting guys on.

591
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,221
Thank you, brother.

592
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,975
I'll buy you a drink?
Buy me a drink.

593
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,232
What's so funny?
Nothing.

594
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,611
It's really dumb.
Something smells negligent.

595
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,697
You two are perfect for each other.
How did you meet?

596
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,537
I knew this guy in, grade school.

597
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,873
He was named Raoul... Whatever.

598
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,710
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers
and fold them over, one over the other.

599
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,837
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

600
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,008
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

601
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:38,514
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

602
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,228
Woman.

603
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,611
This better be earth-shattering.

604
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,661
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

605
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,871
Raoul.
To Raoul.

606
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,207
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

607
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,376
Here's how we found her.

608
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,674
How old?
Sixteen, seventeen.

609
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,884
Been here about six hours.

610
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,511
How'd she die, Rachel?

611
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,098
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

612
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,060
Who's that?

613
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,314
Mother and siblings, I guess.
What the hell they doing here?

614
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:14,192
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

615
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,528
Okay, let's go.

616
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,409
That's nice.

617
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,747
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my
intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

618
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,125
So it's a series,
and ending up in your court.

619
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,420
Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere?
Not yet.

620
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,423
Get her.
Get off me. Get off me.

621
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,091
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

622
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,761
Oh, my God.
Hold it, hold it.

623
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,310
Where is she?
Easy, easy, easy.

624
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,773
Please. Please, come on.

625
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,487
It's okay. It's okay.
Who did this?

626
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,698
Where's my baby? Where is she?

627
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,243
I need to know what happened.

628
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,246
I guess the Earth shattered.

629
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:53,250
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

630
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:58,130
I didn't wanna ruin their night too.
What was it?

631
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,675
You don't wanna know.

632
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,177
I'd like to know
what's behind that grim look.

633
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,806
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

634
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,685
You never told me I'd be excluded.

635
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:17,149
I told you when we hooked up, baby,
that you were gonna have to share me...

636
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,069
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

637
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:25,657
And I bought into that sharing
because I love you.

638
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:31,747
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,
driving a bus. I don't care.

639
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,125
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

640
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,836
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

641
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,006
Oh, I see. What I should do
is come home and say:

642
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:45,051
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

643
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:48,972
...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

644
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,768
...because it was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

645
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,771
Come on, let's share that,
and in sharing it...

646
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:01,943
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit. " Right?

647
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,948
Wrong. You know why?

648
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,284
Because you prefer the normal routine:

649
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,661
We fuck,
then you lose the power of speech.

650
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,372
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

651
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:18,335
I preserve it, because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

652
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,922
Where I gotta be.

653
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,764
You don't live with me.

654
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,186
You live among the remains
of dead people.

655
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,816
You read the terrain.

656
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,320
You search for signs of passing...

657
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,531
...for the scent of your prey...

658
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,491
...and then you hunt them down.

659
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,704
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

660
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,794
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

661
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,386
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

662
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,153
Hey. Miss Lillian.

663
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,907
Let's go, baby.

664
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,205
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

665
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,542
I did time for what
that motherfucker does every day.

666
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,130
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

667
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,465
Can you do that?

668
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,512
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

669
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,812
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

670
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,316
Because I'm proud of you.

671
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,949
You're proud of me?

672
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,955
What the hell you proud of me for?

673
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,917
Come on home.

674
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:35,680
What were you doing there?
I was skiing.

675
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,058
I was trying to ski.

676
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,603
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

677
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,105
...and you meet people.

678
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,774
You try to have a good time.

679
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,609
Did you have a good time?
No.

680
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,902
Why not?

681
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,404
I'm not good at meeting people.

682
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,490
You met me.

683
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,576
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it.

684
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,245
Which is why, probably.

685
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,957
No, it's because you were fine.

686
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,543
Eady.

687
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,255
Take off with me for a while.

688
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,509
Where?
New Zealand.

689
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,929
When?

690
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,474
I have to go separate,
but you could meet me there.

691
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,643
But my job, my-

692
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:26,648
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio, do work there.

693
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,651
I don't know.
What's there to know?

694
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,778
Are you married?

695
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,447
What?
You come and go-

696
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,241
The last thing I am is married.

697
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,452
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way, a double blank.

698
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,454
Then, all of a sudden...

699
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,666
...someone like you comes along.

700
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,839
You don't know me, Neil.
I know enough.

701
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,386
Come with me.

702
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,814
What's wrong, baby?

703
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,277
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

704
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,366
Yeah.

705
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,246
Good.

706
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,814
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.

707
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,193
What happened? You forget
your mom was picking you up?

708
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,154
No.

709
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,532
So, what's going on?

710
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,244
I felt like being alone.

711
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,874
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

712
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:16,382
Hey, Mike.
Hey, Lauren.

713
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,598
What's happening?

714
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,601
Lieutenant. Sir.

715
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,396
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

716
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,566
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

717
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,958
Jackson's a...

718
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,455
Technique.

719
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,893
Open sesame. Right there.

720
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,160
There he goes.

721
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,974
We walk.
I'm right there.

722
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,143
We walk! Now! Come on.

723
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,573
He's heard it.

724
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,992
He's heard it.

725
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,086
Heads up.

726
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,880
One's coming out.
Hold it, captain.

727
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,675
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.
Yeah, I see.

728
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,056
Here we go.
Not till my boss says so.

729
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,725
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

730
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,569
Okay, let them go.
What do you mean?

731
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:29,779
<i>We can take them-</i>

732
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,031
What are you gonna take them on?
Breaking and entry?

733
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,283
They didn't steal anything.
Don't you get it?

734
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,702
It gets knocked back
to some misdemeanor...

735
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,372
...they do six months
and they're out. No fucking way.

736
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,667
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They're not walking.

737
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:46,504
That's exactly what they're gonna do.
They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

738
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,048
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

739
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:53,344
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck.

740
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,475
Back to work.

741
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:45,605
L.A.P.D. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

742
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,440
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

743
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:51,068
The place, not us. Because
it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

744
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,905
Assume they got our phones,
assume they got our houses...

745
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,574
...assume they got us right here,
right now as we sit.

746
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,701
Everything. Assume it all.

747
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,953
How we gonna buy the bank package
from Kelso?

748
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,290
I'll front that. That's not a problem.
What happens to Van Zant?

749
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,461
With the heat we got, do you wanna play
World War ll in the streets with Van Zant?

750
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,546
No, I want my 750.
And he gets a pass?

751
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:15,051
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

752
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,637
Our problem is,
take the bank or split right now?

753
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:20,306
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

754
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,643
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

755
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,061
That's it.

756
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,812
Chris.

757
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:32,151
The bank is worth the risk.

758
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,320
I need it, brother.

759
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:39,158
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

760
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,755
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

761
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,384
No, not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

762
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,357
You figure this is the best thing to do?

763
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,359
This is the best thing to do?

764
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,780
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me
the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

765
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,866
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

766
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,535
You got T-bonds, real estate.

767
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,080
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

768
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:48,227
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

769
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,437
I'm in.

770
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:54,942
You too?

771
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,861
Yeah, sure.

772
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,696
Ha-ha-ha.
Let's go.

773
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,740
Fuck them, let's do it.

774
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,492
All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

775
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,841
You can't go in there.
Watch this.

776
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,177
Excuse me. That-
Tim, I gotta call you back.

777
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,803
You have to have an appointment.

778
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,805
Can I help you?
Are you Alan Marciano?

779
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,433
Yeah, and who the fuck are you?
Who am I?

780
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,686
Hey. Hey.
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

781
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:34,106
L.A.? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

782
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:37,777
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around...

783
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:43,282
...but I know people here, okay?
Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

784
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,911
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant...

785
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,331
...for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago...

786
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,667
...or you go to work for us.

787
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,627
Cut and dried.

788
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,630
That is it.
Oh, shit.

789
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,549
Charlene Shiherlis.

790
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,468
Who?
Who?

791
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,804
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

792
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,808
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day the last week.

793
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,227
Yeah, you know what?
You can't tie me to her.

794
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:15,314
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jack off.

795
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:19,360
Oh, man, I just-
Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

796
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,238
Because she got a great ass!

797
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,909
And you got your head all the way up it.

798
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,494
Jesus.

799
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,667
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

800
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,169
...something comes out of me.

801
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,589
So?
So no big thing.

802
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:45,886
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

803
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,347
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

804
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,604
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.

805
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,441
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

806
01:18:58,608 --> 01:18:59,734
Right.

807
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,737
The security systems
around here are a joke.

808
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,035
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's Escape Route Number 1.

809
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:14,206
Number 2, over here,
Anaheim to the 110.

810
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:15,708
Good.
Okay?

811
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,586
Yeah. That's fine.
Got it? Good. Let's go.

812
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,569
They were looking back...

813
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,071
...in this direction.

814
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:48,240
A container facility?

815
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:52,953
For a cartage theft?
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

816
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:59,084
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

817
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:03,756
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around.
Same for the scrap yard.

818
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,470
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

819
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,935
A refinery and a scrap yard.

820
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:19,939
What the hell is going on?
That's what we're trying to figure out.

821
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,942
We thought we had it.

822
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:24,777
Thought we had it.

823
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:38,999
I got an idea
of what they were looking at.

824
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,214
You wanna know what they're looking at?
What?

825
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,010
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

826
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:54,056
This crew is good.

827
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,393
You know what they were looking at?

828
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,978
What?

829
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,897
Us.

830
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,817
The L.A.P.D.

831
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,361
The police department.

832
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,155
We just got made.

833
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,373
Yeah.

834
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,341
Okay.

835
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:39,560
Okay, motherfucker!

836
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,832
Kelso come through?

837
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,210
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

838
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:14,053
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

839
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,599
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

840
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,727
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

841
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,229
Not yours,
they've been losing you at night.

842
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:28,484
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school.
Marine Corps.

843
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,778
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

844
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,239
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

845
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,659
And he was a fucking maniac.

846
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:41,080
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

847
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:44,249
Current wife's Justine.
He's why the extra heat.

848
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,420
The Vice sergeant...

849
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,757
...says Hanna likes you.

850
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:55,844
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

851
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:58,973
Look how sharp this guy is
to figure that.

852
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,935
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

853
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:06,397
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

854
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,274
Means the man is one of those guys
out there...

855
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:12,361
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

856
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:16,865
With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass.

857
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,624
It's worth the stretch.

858
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:31,463
This guy can hit and miss.
You can't miss once.

859
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:33,632
You sure?

860
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,968
I'm sure.

861
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:42,641
Let's go to the garage.

862
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,157
Justine.

863
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,456
Justine?

864
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,130
Where we going?

865
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,221
Okay, where are you going?
Out.

866
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:22,574
What are you on?
TAC 9.

867
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,309
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

868
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,230
<i>Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40.
Richard Glover's with me.</i>

869
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:57,568
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound
approaching the 110 interchange.</i>

870
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:02,614
<i>You running a revolving tail?
Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

871
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:06,827
Okay, have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

872
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:08,412
Let's go.

873
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:02,382
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

874
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,135
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

875
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:13,578
How you doing?

876
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:19,793
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

877
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:29,219
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
Follow me.

878
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,446
Seven years in Folsom.

879
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:49,448
In the hole for three.

880
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:50,907
McNeil before that.

881
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,830
McNeil as tough as they say?

882
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,583
You looking to become a penologist?

883
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,962
You're looking to go back?
You know, I chase down some crews...

884
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:08,550
...guys just looking to fuck up,
get busted back. That you?

885
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,470
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

886
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,473
I worked all kinds.

887
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,020
You see me doing thrill-seeking
liquor-store holdups...

888
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,522
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo
on my chest?

889
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,525
No, I do not.
Right.

890
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,528
I am never going back.

891
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,407
Then don't take down scores.

892
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,203
I do what I do best, I take scores.

893
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,998
You do what you do best,
trying to stop guys like me.

894
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,046
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

895
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,216
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

896
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,094
Yeah.

897
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:59,768
This regular-type life like your life?
My life? No, my life...

898
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,687
No, my life's a disaster zone.

899
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,275
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

900
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:10,529
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

901
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:14,574
I got a wife. We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage...

902
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,618
...my third...

903
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:21,706
...because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

904
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,917
That's my life.

905
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,967
A guy told me one time:

906
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,512
"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

907
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,390
...you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

908
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:40,725
...if you feel the heat around the corner. "

909
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:45,188
Now, if you're on me,
and you gotta move when I move...

910
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:48,525
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

911
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,571
Well, that's an interesting point.

912
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,949
What are you, a monk?

913
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,909
I have a woman.

914
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:00,078
What do you tell her?

915
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:04,040
I tell her I'm a salesman.

916
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:13,925
So then, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

917
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:17,095
...you're just gonna walk out
on this woman?

918
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,056
Not say goodbye?

919
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,559
That's the discipline.

920
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:24,686
That's pretty vacant, no?

921
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,521
Yeah, it is what it is.

922
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,316
It's that, or we both better
go do something else, pal.

923
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,236
I don't know how to do anything else.

924
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,697
Neither do I.

925
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,620
I don't much want to either.
Neither do I.

926
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,881
You know, I have this recurring dream.

927
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:56,510
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

928
01:31:56,677 --> 01:32:00,555
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

929
01:32:00,723 --> 01:32:04,976
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

930
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:10,148
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

931
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,985
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

932
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:17,239
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

933
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,909
The neighbors reported the smell...

934
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:25,455
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

935
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,208
What do they say?

936
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,670
Nothing.

937
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:33,505
No talk?
None.

938
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,300
Just...
They don't have anything to say.

939
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:40,345
See, we just look at each other.

940
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:45,642
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

941
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,397
I have one where I'm drowning.

942
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,234
And I gotta wake myself up
and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

943
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:57,821
You know what that's about?

944
01:32:58,322 --> 01:33:01,032
Yeah. Having enough time.

945
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:07,789
Enough time to do what you wanna do?
That's right.

946
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,378
You doing it now?
No, not yet.

947
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,552
You know, we're sitting here...

948
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,722
...you and I,
like a couple of regular fellows.

949
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:26,600
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

950
01:33:28,894 --> 01:33:31,896
And now that we've been face to face...

951
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:39,195
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away,
I won't like it.

952
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:40,697
But I'll tell you...

953
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:46,745
...if it's between you
and some poor bastard...

954
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,414
...whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow...

955
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:54,586
...brother, you are going down.

956
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:09,142
There's a flip side to that coin.

957
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:15,273
What if you do got me boxed in
and I gotta put you down?

958
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:21,279
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

959
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,908
We've been face to face, yeah...

960
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:31,623
...but I will not hesitate.
Not for a second.

961
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,798
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

962
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,761
Or who knows?

963
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:47,722
Or maybe
we'll never see each other again.

964
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,781
They dumped us.

965
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,409
What?

966
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:10,870
They dumped us.
What do you mean, they dumped us?

967
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:12,122
Chris slipped his tail.

968
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,874
He doesn't talk about scores
with Charlene...

969
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,627
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I tried.

970
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,046
What about Cheritto?
Same.

971
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,966
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

972
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:29,848
They dumped all our surveillance?
Yeah, at the same time. Nine p. m.

973
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:34,185
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

974
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:36,688
We were on you.
Then McCauley drives into LAX...

975
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:39,858
...where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

976
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:43,361
His car's still there. He's gone.

977
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:53,747
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

978
01:36:52,389 --> 01:36:54,098
You hear from him yet?

979
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:58,728
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

980
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:05,527
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

981
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:11,741
Who are you?

982
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,788
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

983
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,542
I've been living in this office day and night.
How well do you know him?

984
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:24,796
Oh, we took some major scores together.

985
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:29,801
How come I haven't heard from him?

986
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,805
Well, he's probably busy right now,
but he's real thorough.

987
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:39,102
He ain't gonna forget about you.
Oh, that's reassuring.

988
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,023
Well, I got some moves
I could make here.

989
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:47,485
Probably be a big help to you.

990
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:09,841
You recognize the grill man?

991
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:22,312
No.
Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

992
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,525
Ain't got my break yet, man.
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

993
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:30,695
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

994
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,822
Take your break later.

995
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:36,326
Piece of shit. Pick up.

996
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:40,830
Where the hell is he?

997
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:44,334
I wanted to check the slot for a work car.
So did I.

998
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:50,924
Yeah?

999
01:38:52,134 --> 01:38:53,635
Hang on.

1000
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:55,929
Yeah.
Hey.

1001
01:38:56,096 --> 01:39:00,642
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

1002
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:02,060
All right.

1003
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,073
Where are you?
There's cops all over me, man.

1004
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,243
They're on me like a cheap suit.
I can't dump them.

1005
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:25,708
After the fact you spotted them?
No, no. They're doing parallels.

1006
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,004
I can try to dump them again.

1007
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:34,550
How are we gonna know if you did?
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1008
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,844
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1009
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:41,099
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.
Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

1010
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,707
Come on, man.

1011
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:08,918
Pick up.

1012
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,714
Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up?
What's up, brother?

1013
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:15,258
Man, what you doing here?

1014
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,178
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners and a radio.

1015
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:20,388
Right now, today.

1016
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:21,973
You remember the drill?

1017
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:23,516
Yeah, man, sure.

1018
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:25,018
You cool?

1019
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,645
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1020
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:31,149
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1021
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,373
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1022
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,835
Out back in five.

1023
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:02,472
What's burning? What's burning?
Nothing I'm doing.

1024
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,348
What is this?

1025
01:41:04,516 --> 01:41:06,684
Where do you think you're going?

1026
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:13,900
Just came across a first edition
of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

1027
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:16,319
Yeah. No, it's in good condition.

1028
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:19,822
<i>And it will not stop
or answer radio communication.</i>

1029
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,367
<i>The 180-foot vessel is called
Jin Yin Number 1...</i>

1030
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:26,537
<i>...and is suspected of smuggling
Chinese illegal aliens.</i>

1031
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:28,706
<i>It was spotted Saturday by patrol aircraft.</i>

1032
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,573
Stay down.
Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1033
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:47,118
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air! Put them up!

1034
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,288
Down, down! Get on your knees.

1035
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:52,290
Give me the keys.
Get on your knees.

1036
01:42:52,457 --> 01:42:54,250
Get on your knees!

1037
01:42:57,254 --> 01:43:00,965
Hey. Hey! Get over there.
Get the fuck- Get down.

1038
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,634
Turn around! Put your hands behind you.
Behind you!

1039
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:05,761
Get down! Stay down!

1040
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,682
Get down! Get down!
Down, you stupid son of a-

1041
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,811
Down! Down, now!
Keys! Keys! Keys!

1042
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:18,816
All of you stay down.

1043
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:23,321
We want to hurt no one. We're here
for the bank's money, not your money.

1044
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,990
Your money's insured.
You're not gonna lose a dime.

1045
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,994
Think of your families. Don't risk your life.
Don't try and be a hero.

1046
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:33,664
Right now I want you to sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

1047
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:38,336
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart
trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.

1048
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,714
Give me the key.
What key?

1049
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:46,385
Get down and stay down!

1050
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:49,180
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move.
Let it bleed.

1051
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,191
Get down!

1052
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,676
Hey. Hey!

1053
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:37,270
Put your head down.

1054
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,690
Look at me again, I'll kill you.
Stay down. Down.

1055
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:45,194
Put your head down!
Get down. Get down.

1056
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,550
Hey, Casals.
Yeah.

1057
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,094
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1058
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:14,557
This Cl, Hugh Benny, called in about a bank
they're looking at or something.

1059
01:45:14,766 --> 01:45:15,933
Vincent.

1060
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,603
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1061
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:39,206
I want a block at Figueroa and 5th...

1062
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:43,252
...and I want a block
northbound Flower at 6th.

1063
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,333
They're already coming out.

1064
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:27,088
Okay, we're gonna have to take them
in the car. Wait till they are all in.

1065
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:29,632
Get clean shots.
Watch your background.

1066
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,518
Police! Move!
What's going on?

1067
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,687
Move. Move. Get down.

1068
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:49,026
Look out.

1069
01:47:01,873 --> 01:47:03,916
Move it, come on.
L.A.P.D. Get down.

1070
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:06,877
Move it. Down, down, down.

1071
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,216
We did it, right, Neil?

1072
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,513
Move!

1073
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,895
Get down.

1074
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:33,529
Fuck. Fuck!

1075
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,197
In the car!

1076
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:53,716
Go! Go! Go!

1077
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,908
Son of a bitch!
Go, go!

1078
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:55,819
Go!

1079
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,345
Go!

1080
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,059
Go!

1081
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:04,698
Come on. Come on.

1082
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,331
Get him out of here.

1083
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,190
Get down! Now!

1084
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:42,361
Shit.

1085
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:49,326
Shit.

1086
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:54,998
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way!
Get them down! Now, now!

1087
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:57,376
No, out of the way. Out of the way.

1088
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:49,178
Mommy? Mommy!

1089
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:50,637
Oh!

1090
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:56,477
Come here, honey.

1091
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:39,102
Come on, honey.

1092
01:53:41,689 --> 01:53:45,818
I got you. It's okay now.

1093
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:51,865
<i>Tragedy in a Southland neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

1094
01:53:52,033 --> 01:53:55,202
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?</i>

1095
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:59,122
<i>This afternoon, this neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1096
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:03,126
<i>With the streets full of mid-day shoppers
and kids, police and armed robbers...</i>

1097
01:54:03,294 --> 01:54:05,963
Excuse me, bartender?
One minute, lady.

1098
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:08,674
<i>- robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1099
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,969
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...</i>

1100
01:54:12,136 --> 01:54:14,721
<i>...that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1101
01:54:14,889 --> 01:54:18,725
<i>One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one
of four men involved in the foiled robbery.</i>

1102
01:54:18,893 --> 01:54:21,144
<i>He died at the scene.
What can I get you, miss?</i>

1103
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,647
<i>Also fatally wounded,
suspect Donald Breedan...</i>

1104
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,315
Miss?

1105
01:54:25,483 --> 01:54:29,319
<i>- during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.</i>

1106
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:32,865
All right, hold him. Hold him.

1107
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:34,449
All right. All right.
It's all right.

1108
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:45,335
So?
Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

1109
01:54:45,503 --> 01:54:50,048
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine
for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

1110
01:54:50,216 --> 01:54:51,925
Bottom line.

1111
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:56,179
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good,
but his clavicle's fractured.

1112
01:54:56,347 --> 01:54:59,266
Can he rest for a while?
Six, seven hours.

1113
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,226
That's it?
That's it.

1114
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:03,645
Take off your shirt.
What?

1115
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,524
Take off your shirt.

1116
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:16,950
My- Look, my daughter gave it to me
for Father's Day.

1117
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:20,037
I don't give a shit who gave it to you.
Take it off.

1118
01:55:25,501 --> 01:55:27,878
Chris. Hey.

1119
01:55:29,964 --> 01:55:32,674
Chris, listen to me.

1120
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:37,054
Nate's gonna pick you up.
He's gonna take you to his place.

1121
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:41,058
Where's Charlene?
We gotta get out of here.

1122
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:43,018
We're all over the 6:00 news.

1123
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:46,521
We gotta get out of here.
I'm not going without her.

1124
01:55:46,689 --> 01:55:50,067
Think about that.
I will meet you at Nate's.

1125
01:55:50,234 --> 01:55:51,360
Where are you going?

1126
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:55,822
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1127
01:55:56,074 --> 01:55:57,741
Who did it?

1128
01:55:58,576 --> 01:56:00,118
Who wasn't there?

1129
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,955
Trejo.

1130
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:07,584
I'll see you at Nate's.

1131
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,802
Yeah.
Yeah. You still want me?

1132
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:22,224
You come down here right now
and you get me. Dominick and me. Okay?

1133
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:26,269
<i>Okay, baby, okay.
I'll be there in two hours, all right?</i>

1134
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:28,689
<i>Okay?
All right.</i>

1135
01:56:30,274 --> 01:56:33,819
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1136
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,240
You're on a plane for Los Angeles.
Great.

1137
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,206
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1138
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:31,418
They made me.
Who?

1139
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,336
Where's Anna?

1140
01:57:33,838 --> 01:57:34,880
She's dead.

1141
01:57:38,092 --> 01:57:41,178
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1142
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:45,849
Who did it? Who did it?
They had Anna, man.

1143
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,768
Who had her?

1144
01:57:48,519 --> 01:57:50,103
Waingro.

1145
01:57:50,271 --> 01:57:52,147
Waingro.

1146
01:57:52,398 --> 01:57:53,523
On his own?

1147
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:57,736
For someone.
Who?

1148
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:00,238
The other he worked for.

1149
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:04,076
Zant.

1150
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:09,623
Van Zant?
Yeah.

1151
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,625
Van Zant.

1152
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:14,878
Are you sure?
Van Zant.

1153
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:19,549
Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1154
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:23,220
I don't think so, Neil.
Come on.

1155
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,807
I don't remember, Neil.

1156
01:58:32,313 --> 01:58:36,024
I'll call a medic.
I'm not gonna make it.

1157
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:40,570
I can't feel nothing.

1158
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,866
My Anna's gone.

1159
01:58:46,035 --> 01:58:48,286
She's gone.

1160
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:54,000
Don't leave me like this, Neil.
Please, holmes.

1161
01:58:55,336 --> 01:58:58,046
Don't leave me like this.

1162
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,613
Yeah?
Nate.

1163
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,908
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1164
01:59:27,535 --> 01:59:28,702
It's a new one.

1165
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:33,039
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1166
01:59:33,207 --> 01:59:36,543
10725.
10725, okay.

1167
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,921
Chris?
He's with me, at my place.

1168
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:42,424
Next, Waingro, okay?

1169
01:59:44,552 --> 01:59:45,635
You got the time?

1170
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:49,973
I'll make time,
and I need a new out laid on.

1171
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,100
How do you know it's blown?

1172
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:55,896
How can I trust it?

1173
01:59:58,566 --> 02:00:00,442
Okay, you got it.

1174
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,652
Stay healthy.

1175
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,618
Charlene Shiherlis.

1176
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:13,163
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1177
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:16,541
Our Neil's transportation.
When we're done here, get on the phone.

1178
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:19,252
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

1179
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:21,796
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway?

1180
02:00:21,964 --> 02:00:26,343
Sure he did. Now he needs another one.
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1181
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:29,721
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1182
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:33,433
He's a Cl for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1183
02:00:33,601 --> 02:00:37,145
On Neil McCauley,
how much time we got?

1184
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:40,690
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out.
After that, he's gone.

1185
02:00:40,858 --> 02:00:42,817
Bye-bye. Bam.

1186
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:40,083
You ratted McCauley to us.
How'd you know? Who told you?

1187
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:42,877
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1188
02:01:43,045 --> 02:01:44,671
Who?

1189
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:15,952
<i>Connelly back in for Murphy.
Murphy with Leggat right there with him.</i>

1190
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,912
<i>Murphy tees it up behind the net...</i>

1191
02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:25,295
<i>- Miller out front.
Now here's Murphy with the referee...</i>

1192
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:30,050
Waingro, where is he?

1193
02:02:31,427 --> 02:02:33,678
Where is he?
How the hell would I know?

1194
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:03,375
Well, what do we have here?

1195
02:03:03,834 --> 02:03:07,462
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.

1196
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:12,967
You slimy piece of shit.
You told me you wanted out from under.

1197
02:03:13,135 --> 02:03:16,304
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1198
02:03:16,472 --> 02:03:20,141
Yeah, what's your end?
I- You stupid broad.

1199
02:03:20,309 --> 02:03:22,769
How'd I get into this?
Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1200
02:03:22,937 --> 02:03:24,145
You heard me.

1201
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:27,357
She had a rough ride.
Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1202
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:30,527
Look in the cabinet above the sink.
Fuck her.

1203
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:36,074
You'd better get in there and stay in there.
All right, all right.

1204
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,079
Well, lookie here.

1205
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:44,541
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1206
02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:48,711
You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom?
He stays with me.

1207
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:51,131
There we go.

1208
02:03:58,722 --> 02:04:00,682
So, what now?

1209
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:06,688
Well, he's right,
because you want out, this is out.

1210
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:11,985
You believe you have to betray Chris.
No shit.

1211
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:15,113
That's right. You would have to.

1212
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:19,534
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1213
02:04:20,035 --> 02:04:23,246
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1214
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,874
...because you got no living parents
to take him.

1215
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:30,420
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes,
juvenile facilities.

1216
02:04:30,588 --> 02:04:32,839
Then he steals a car.

1217
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:38,261
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1218
02:04:38,429 --> 02:04:41,723
Fucked for life.

1219
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:45,226
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1220
02:04:46,395 --> 02:04:51,566
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1221
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:56,237
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1222
02:04:56,405 --> 02:05:00,325
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1223
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:07,874
What else are you selling?
All kinds of shit.

1224
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:13,963
But I don't have to sell this and you know it,
because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1225
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:22,263
<i>Okay, Danny, here's an update.</i>

1226
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:25,767
Drucker's on Line 2.
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1227
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:30,063
Lieutenant, I have Drucker
on the other line.

1228
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:31,606
Oh, well, conference him in.

1229
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:36,819
Go ahead.
Vincent, it's me.

1230
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:41,366
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1231
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:50,458
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1232
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:53,795
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1233
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:59,801
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life
and become a born-again good citizen.

1234
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:04,514
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1235
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:07,433
Waingro used to be a part
of Neil's crew...

1236
02:06:07,601 --> 02:06:11,187
...then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1237
02:06:11,355 --> 02:06:17,151
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1238
02:06:17,486 --> 02:06:20,822
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.

1239
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:24,325
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the airport Marquis...

1240
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:27,870
...under the name "Jameson. "
He's there now.

1241
02:06:28,038 --> 02:06:31,124
I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1242
02:06:31,292 --> 02:06:34,502
<i>...assignment officers
and snitches in County.</i>

1243
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:37,046
Anyone you can think of
who'll put it on the street.

1244
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:41,384
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally
check their coms every 30 minutes.

1245
02:06:41,552 --> 02:06:45,638
Because maybe Neil will go for him.
Okay? How you feeling?

1246
02:06:46,348 --> 02:06:49,601
Banged up, but I'll live.
Okay.

1247
02:06:56,984 --> 02:06:58,860
He's here.

1248
02:06:59,153 --> 02:07:01,362
Neil is still here.

1249
02:07:01,905 --> 02:07:03,865
I can feel it.

1250
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:06,659
But for how long?

1251
02:07:07,244 --> 02:07:10,163
Seven, eight hours, max.

1252
02:07:18,547 --> 02:07:19,881
What did you do?

1253
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:24,302
That was you?
It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

1254
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:27,388
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1255
02:07:27,556 --> 02:07:31,559
Now we gotta go together.
Those other people were with you?

1256
02:07:33,687 --> 02:07:35,813
My friend, Michael...

1257
02:07:36,899 --> 02:07:39,525
...he knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

1258
02:07:43,530 --> 02:07:46,157
It rains, you get wet.

1259
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:49,410
Get packed and let's go.

1260
02:07:56,585 --> 02:07:57,752
Eady.

1261
02:07:58,212 --> 02:07:59,253
Eady.

1262
02:08:09,014 --> 02:08:12,266
Why did you do this to me?

1263
02:08:17,773 --> 02:08:19,816
Who are you?

1264
02:08:22,653 --> 02:08:25,780
It's gonna be all right.
You understand? It'll be all right.

1265
02:08:30,661 --> 02:08:32,787
It's gonna be all right.

1266
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:35,415
Right.

1267
02:08:44,007 --> 02:08:47,635
There's this Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1268
02:08:52,349 --> 02:08:54,392
Here's some cash.

1269
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:58,146
When's it over?

1270
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:03,192
Twenty-two hours from now.

1271
02:09:03,652 --> 02:09:07,363
Then we get out of here clean.
When will you let me leave?

1272
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:14,162
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1273
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:16,998
Will you let me leave later?

1274
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,297
It will be different.

1275
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:27,508
Do you understand?

1276
02:09:57,998 --> 02:09:59,540
It's ready.

1277
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,542
Vincent.

1278
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:09,133
This is my friend Ralph.

1279
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,260
You didn't tell me you were...

1280
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:15,223
Oh, my God.
Where's Lauren?

1281
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:18,601
She's at Lisa-Beth's.
Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1282
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:22,688
I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1283
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,399
Don't you even get angry?

1284
02:10:25,567 --> 02:10:28,069
I'm angry, yeah.
Oh.

1285
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:30,655
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1286
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:33,908
You know, you can ball my wife
if she wants you to.

1287
02:10:35,494 --> 02:10:38,579
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1288
02:10:39,915 --> 02:10:42,208
In her ex-husband's...

1289
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:47,421
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house, if you want to...

1290
02:10:49,258 --> 02:10:55,596
...but you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

1291
02:10:55,764 --> 02:10:57,265
For God's sake.

1292
02:11:03,814 --> 02:11:05,606
Put the television set down.

1293
02:11:05,774 --> 02:11:08,317
I never cheated on you, bitch.
Maybe you should have.

1294
02:11:08,485 --> 02:11:10,778
I should have?
In a way, you're a party to this.

1295
02:11:10,946 --> 02:11:13,990
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1296
02:11:14,157 --> 02:11:15,324
Our situation is absurd.

1297
02:11:17,035 --> 02:11:21,873
Look, maybe I should-
Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1298
02:11:23,959 --> 02:11:27,879
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

1299
02:11:28,046 --> 02:11:31,883
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.
How admirable.

1300
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:34,135
You bet.
Except none of it's about us.

1301
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,012
No.

1302
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:41,058
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

1303
02:11:41,226 --> 02:11:43,853
...but you've been walking
through our life dead.

1304
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:48,691
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1305
02:12:01,246 --> 02:12:03,497
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1306
02:12:04,166 --> 02:12:09,003
The plane, charter terminal, LAX,
Hangar 17.

1307
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:10,922
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1308
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:18,012
Touches down, holds for you five minutes,
then splits.

1309
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:21,682
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1310
02:12:23,685 --> 02:12:26,020
Hey, where's Chris?
He's gone.

1311
02:12:27,481 --> 02:12:28,522
What?

1312
02:12:29,149 --> 02:12:31,692
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

1313
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:34,695
Didn't you bring him here?
Yeah, I brought him here.

1314
02:12:35,155 --> 02:12:36,989
What happened?

1315
02:12:37,157 --> 02:12:39,533
It's a free country, brother.

1316
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:48,376
Check in with me at 9.
Everything's still cool.

1317
02:12:49,711 --> 02:12:51,379
All right.

1318
02:13:13,944 --> 02:13:16,904
I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

1319
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:21,993
I know life is short.

1320
02:13:22,244 --> 02:13:24,870
Whatever time you get is luck.

1321
02:13:27,082 --> 02:13:29,166
You wanna walk?

1322
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:33,713
You walk right now.

1323
02:13:34,798 --> 02:13:36,924
Or on your own...

1324
02:13:37,092 --> 02:13:40,136
On your own,
you choose to come with me.

1325
02:13:46,226 --> 02:13:48,269
All I know is...

1326
02:13:50,063 --> 02:13:54,400
All I know is there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1327
02:13:54,943 --> 02:13:57,028
...if it's gonna be alone...

1328
02:13:57,946 --> 02:13:59,739
...without you.

1329
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,164
Eady.

1330
02:14:57,881 --> 02:15:00,341
Yeah.
Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1331
02:15:01,051 --> 02:15:02,676
Okay, I'll hold.

1332
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:06,722
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1333
02:15:07,849 --> 02:15:09,683
Yeah, do it.
Shut up!

1334
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:16,649
Now, just one second at the window...

1335
02:15:17,442 --> 02:15:19,193
...and it's all over.

1336
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:10,846
Hey, man.

1337
02:17:11,097 --> 02:17:13,057
Yeah?
You know any...

1338
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:16,018
...place to rent around here?

1339
02:17:17,103 --> 02:17:18,229
Yeah.

1340
02:17:18,396 --> 02:17:20,981
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall.

1341
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:22,191
Yeah, thanks.

1342
02:17:33,411 --> 02:17:36,080
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1343
02:17:43,755 --> 02:17:45,881
Unit 2, this is Command.

1344
02:17:46,049 --> 02:17:48,717
Take him at the street and check him out.

1345
02:17:48,885 --> 02:17:50,386
<i>10-4.</i>

1346
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:15,786
Sergeant?
Yeah.

1347
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:18,539
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.

1348
02:18:18,707 --> 02:18:22,459
<i>Car's registered to the last name Bukowski,
first name Gene.</i>

1349
02:18:22,627 --> 02:18:25,504
<i>Ran it to DMV. It's clean.</i>

1350
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:31,051
Let him go.
Roger.

1351
02:18:31,219 --> 02:18:33,554
Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

1352
02:18:35,307 --> 02:18:37,266
It's a no-go, Vince.

1353
02:18:46,359 --> 02:18:49,153
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1354
02:18:49,321 --> 02:18:51,405
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1355
02:19:21,394 --> 02:19:23,395
Yeah?
Yeah, what do you got?

1356
02:19:23,563 --> 02:19:25,647
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1357
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:40,287
Yeah?
Hello, it's Vincent.

1358
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,455
<i>What do you got?</i>

1359
02:19:41,623 --> 02:19:45,959
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.
That's it.

1360
02:19:54,302 --> 02:19:56,136
You know what?

1361
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:00,182
Neil is gone.

1362
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:04,019
Bam!

1363
02:20:04,604 --> 02:20:08,023
Flying like a bird.
Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

1364
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:13,362
We still got bait. Maybe some time!
Got, got. What do we got?

1365
02:20:13,530 --> 02:20:15,364
What do we got?

1366
02:20:15,782 --> 02:20:18,450
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1367
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:21,370
You were good.

1368
02:20:22,455 --> 02:20:23,997
I'm going to the hotel.

1369
02:20:25,417 --> 02:20:27,876
I'm gonna take a shower.

1370
02:20:28,461 --> 02:20:31,964
Gonna sleep for a month.

1371
02:22:41,886 --> 02:22:43,679
Over here.

1372
02:22:50,353 --> 02:22:52,271
Come on, baby.

1373
02:22:54,232 --> 02:22:56,525
Okay, okay.

1374
02:22:59,988 --> 02:23:01,947
Shit.

1375
02:23:02,824 --> 02:23:04,825
Let me tighten this.

1376
02:23:10,331 --> 02:23:12,332
What a fucking waste.

1377
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:14,835
Okay, here.

1378
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:21,383
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.
Not you, baby. Not you.

1379
02:23:26,222 --> 02:23:29,683
Where would she be?
Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1380
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:32,102
I'm supposed to be here with her.
But the police-

1381
02:23:39,027 --> 02:23:42,195
Help me. I need somebody to help-
It's okay.

1382
02:23:43,656 --> 02:23:45,240
I got you.

1383
02:23:47,869 --> 02:23:49,036
I got you, baby.

1384
02:23:50,371 --> 02:23:53,707
It'll be all right, honey. I swear.
It's okay, baby.

1385
02:23:53,875 --> 02:23:57,919
Let's get a doctor! Let's go!
A doctor here! There's your mama.

1386
02:23:58,087 --> 02:23:59,963
Let's just calm down.
Your mama's here.

1387
02:24:00,131 --> 02:24:01,965
Is she on any drugs?
No.

1388
02:24:04,886 --> 02:24:07,679
I want you to get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1389
02:24:07,847 --> 02:24:11,099
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1390
02:24:11,267 --> 02:24:14,603
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1391
02:24:14,771 --> 02:24:16,480
It's ready.
Oh-

1392
02:24:17,982 --> 02:24:21,151
When's the last time anybody saw her?
I don't know.

1393
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:24,404
Where did you find her?
The bathtub.

1394
02:24:24,572 --> 02:24:28,116
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore
normal saline. Wide open.

1395
02:24:28,284 --> 02:24:31,411
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units, O-negative.

1396
02:24:31,579 --> 02:24:34,623
Let's type and cross her for six.
Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1397
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:36,667
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1398
02:24:36,834 --> 02:24:38,627
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1399
02:24:38,795 --> 02:24:41,505
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1400
02:24:46,511 --> 02:24:51,139
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1401
02:24:51,307 --> 02:24:55,477
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be
out to speak to you in a few moments.

1402
02:24:55,645 --> 02:24:57,521
She's okay?
She's doing good.

1403
02:24:57,689 --> 02:24:59,856
She's gonna be okay.
She's gonna be okay.

1404
02:25:00,024 --> 02:25:02,901
Oh, my baby.
She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1405
02:25:03,069 --> 02:25:06,196
It's all right.
Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1406
02:25:06,364 --> 02:25:10,575
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1407
02:25:11,619 --> 02:25:13,453
There.

1408
02:25:13,871 --> 02:25:16,790
It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

1409
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:19,000
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1410
02:25:19,168 --> 02:25:20,210
You understand?
Yeah.

1411
02:25:20,378 --> 02:25:22,462
I ain't going anywhere.

1412
02:25:35,268 --> 02:25:36,101
Yeah?

1413
02:25:36,769 --> 02:25:37,769
It's me.

1414
02:25:38,354 --> 02:25:41,606
Plane's in the air now.
It'll be right on time.

1415
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:45,819
On the driver's end, I still can't
find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1416
02:25:45,987 --> 02:25:47,863
<i>One other thing.</i>

1417
02:25:48,322 --> 02:25:49,906
<i>You asked, so I gotta tell you.</i>

1418
02:25:50,742 --> 02:25:53,618
The guy you wanted checked into
the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1419
02:25:53,786 --> 02:25:57,164
...if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

1420
02:25:57,331 --> 02:26:01,084
You figured right.
So, so long, brother.

1421
02:26:02,795 --> 02:26:04,755
You take it easy.

1422
02:26:04,922 --> 02:26:06,506
You're home free.

1423
02:26:08,259 --> 02:26:10,218
Take it easy.

1424
02:26:20,563 --> 02:26:23,315
What is it?
Nothing.

1425
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,025
Home free.

1426
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:05,899
I gotta take care of something.
Is there time?

1427
02:27:06,901 --> 02:27:08,568
There's time.

1428
02:27:36,973 --> 02:27:40,100
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1429
02:28:21,517 --> 02:28:23,977
Registration.
Yeah, this is Room Service.

1430
02:28:24,145 --> 02:28:27,981
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up
his room number. Could you give it to me?

1431
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:30,025
<i>They're always doing that.
Yeah, I know.</i>

1432
02:28:30,192 --> 02:28:33,278
<i>1735.
Thank you.</i>

1433
02:30:16,757 --> 02:30:18,466
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1434
02:30:18,634 --> 02:30:21,886
<i>We are currently experiencing
a fire alarm.</i>

1435
02:30:22,054 --> 02:30:25,432
<i>Please do not panic.
Please do not take the elevators.</i>

1436
02:30:29,437 --> 02:30:32,063
Shit.
Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1437
02:30:32,231 --> 02:30:35,817
I'm checking the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1438
02:30:40,114 --> 02:30:42,532
What about her dad?
You want me to call him?

1439
02:30:43,534 --> 02:30:46,369
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1440
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:49,998
And she chose you.

1441
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:54,377
She picked your place.

1442
02:30:55,921 --> 02:30:57,380
It's not right, what happened to her.

1443
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:00,383
No, it's not.

1444
02:31:03,804 --> 02:31:05,847
Okay.

1445
02:31:16,025 --> 02:31:18,151
Is there any way...

1446
02:31:20,112 --> 02:31:22,614
...that it could work out between us?

1447
02:31:24,992 --> 02:31:27,577
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1448
02:31:27,745 --> 02:31:31,039
But in the end...

1449
02:31:35,503 --> 02:31:37,670
You know, it's like you said:

1450
02:31:40,382 --> 02:31:45,053
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1451
02:31:51,936 --> 02:31:54,854
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1452
02:32:05,324 --> 02:32:07,951
Well, go on, if you have to.

1453
02:32:08,119 --> 02:32:09,702
No.

1454
02:32:09,995 --> 02:32:13,206
I'll stay.
No, I'm okay. I can- I can handle this.

1455
02:32:16,377 --> 02:32:18,378
Just be careful.

1456
02:32:18,629 --> 02:32:21,381
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1457
02:32:22,299 --> 02:32:23,842
Okay?

1458
02:33:05,718 --> 02:33:06,759
Take the stairs.

1459
02:33:20,733 --> 02:33:21,774
Yeah?

1460
02:33:23,986 --> 02:33:28,156
Security. There's a fire on 3.
We have to evacuate all the floors.

1461
02:33:28,324 --> 02:33:29,949
I can't leave here.

1462
02:33:38,834 --> 02:33:42,253
Why don't we just talk about this a bit,
brother?

1463
02:33:56,268 --> 02:33:57,310
He's here on 17.

1464
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:02,815
Look at me. Look at me.

1465
02:34:06,153 --> 02:34:07,320
Look at me.

1466
02:34:39,228 --> 02:34:43,106
L.A.P.D. Don't move.
Put your hands on your head, now.

1467
02:35:18,225 --> 02:35:20,560
Switch me to TAC 5.

1468
02:35:20,728 --> 02:35:23,062
Casals? JJ?

1469
02:35:23,981 --> 02:35:25,189
Drucker, JJ?

1470
02:35:25,357 --> 02:35:27,900
<i>I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

1471
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:29,068
What have you got?

1472
02:35:29,236 --> 02:35:32,405
<i>Teams are moving up the other
elevators to the 17th floor elevators.</i>

1473
02:35:32,573 --> 02:35:34,741
<i>All out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

1474
02:35:34,908 --> 02:35:38,036
<i>It's a mess. People everywhere.
Fine. 10-4.</i>

1475
02:36:07,858 --> 02:36:09,442
Let's go, get out of the way.

1476
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,527
Stay out of the way.

1477
02:36:19,453 --> 02:36:22,497
Let's go. Go that way.
We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1478
02:36:25,626 --> 02:36:27,543
I got it, sir.

1479
02:36:29,671 --> 02:36:31,589
Come on, come on.

1480
02:36:37,429 --> 02:36:39,055
Come on, sir.

1481
02:36:43,310 --> 02:36:46,312
Watch your backs, ladies.
I got it, I got it.

1482
02:36:48,982 --> 02:36:50,650
Keep moving, ma'am.

1483
02:36:51,485 --> 02:36:52,568
Let's go.

1484
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:56,322
Come on, let's go.

1485
02:37:30,941 --> 02:37:32,608
This way, ma'am.

1486
02:37:34,570 --> 02:37:36,362
Get back, get back.

1487
02:38:02,222 --> 02:38:04,640
Let me have that shotgun.
Yes, sir.

1488
02:44:22,102 --> 02:44:24,854
Told you I'm never going back.

1489
02:44:28,191 --> 02:44:29,817
Yeah.
