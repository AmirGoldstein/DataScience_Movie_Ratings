1
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,411
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,788
<i>Funny name for an Englishman,
I know.</i>

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,411
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,042
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,836
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,043
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,470
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:01,392
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,016
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,690
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,816
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,023
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,326
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,076
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,209
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,038
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,373
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,594
<i>-Himy, would you listen to this?
-Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,305
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken
literally.</i>

20
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,009
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,594
<i>It's bound with moral fibre...</i>

22
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,435
<i>...but asking a grown man
to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,525
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,276
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,902
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,862
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,323
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,952
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,672
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,171
<i>Enough already.
Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,174
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,633
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...</i>

33
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,056
<i>...into the Greek word for "virgin."</i>

34
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,725
<i>It was an easy mistake to make...</i>

35
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,522
<i>...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,871
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,285
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son."</i>

38
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,668
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,051
<i>It's not every day a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:19,401
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...</i>

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,193
<i>...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,616
<i>Oy vay, what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,410
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written...</i>

44
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,200
<i>...doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,375
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,090
<i>-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear any more.</i>

47
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,544
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,883
<i>-Michael.
-Hello?</i>

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,806
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,769
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,896
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,060
-Michael.
-Mutti.

53
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:03,066
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,739
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,334
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,879
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,413
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,925
-Get down!
-Get fucking down!

59
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,382
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,012
On the ground!

61
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,014
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,309
-Time.
-Seven minutes!

63
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,643
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,031
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,198
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,539
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,289
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,542
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,886
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,391
When you get to London...

71
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,518
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,562
...call this number.

73
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,364
-Boris.
-Boris.

74
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,868
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,918
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,427
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,721
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,594
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

79
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,180
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,644
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,349
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,569
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,400
Why me?

84
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,027
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,699
How's that?

86
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,408
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,958
And I don't wanna have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,455
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,004
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,089
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,133
I'm just not sure about the colour.

92
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,512
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,552
Here's an address.

94
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,718
It's a campsite.

95
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,306
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,273
-What's happening with the sausages?
-Five minutes.

97
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,115
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,942
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,953
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,781
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,582
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,672
-What's that?
-It's me belt.

103
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,257
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,674
-What's a gun doing in your trousers?
-It's for protection.

105
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,088
Protection from what?

106
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,181
<i>“Lee“ Germans?</i>

107
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,598
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

108
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,064
-Where did you get it?
-Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,812
You mean Boris the sneaky
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,067
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,855
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,448
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,322
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,663
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,250
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,165
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,463
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,343
<i>Tommy runs the other business...</i>

119
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,421
<i>...the slot machines...</i>

120
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,224
<i>...which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

121
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,888
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

122
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,265
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,436
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's
newfound enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

124
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,233
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

125
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,650
<i>Brick Top.</i>

126
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,574
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

127
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,911
-He doesn't look bad, does he?
-No, he looks great.

128
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,533
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,917
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

130
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,172
It's what you deserve.

131
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,792
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,085
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,592
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,260
No. No, I'm not.

135
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,929
However...

136
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,430
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,935
All except loyalty.

138
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:13,607
<i>It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...</i>

139
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,986
<i>...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

140
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,616
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,621
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,791
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,506
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,803
<i>If you got to deal with him, just make
sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

145
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,216
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

146
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,684
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

147
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,314
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

148
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,067
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

149
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,527
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

150
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,777
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.</i>

151
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:05,037
<i>Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

152
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,956
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

153
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,041
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,493
Don't know what you mean.

155
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,956
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

156
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:20,423
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,879
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,675
<i>You can sort me out
by showing me out.</i>

159
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,727
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...</i>

160
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,521
<i>...you do something
against your principles.</i>

161
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,766
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

162
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,442
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,236
Who's talking to you?

164
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,858
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

165
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,276
Don't let me down.

166
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,863
You don't want to
let me down, do you?

167
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,034
See you ringside.

168
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,882
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,752
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,639
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

171
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,091
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,144
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,764
But don't you hit him either.

174
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,108
Americans can't know
it was Russian.

175
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,023
It will come back to me.

176
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,025
So, what should I do?

177
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,198
You're my brother, so think like it.

178
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,490
Get somebody else
to steal that stone!

179
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,821
I don't want it getting back to me.

180
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,957
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

181
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,955
So don't use idiots for the job.

182
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,831
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

183
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,508
...so move quick. Okay?

184
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,969
It's okay.
I know a couple of guys.

185
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,804
One more thing.

186
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,594
It might help.

187
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,759
He loves to gamble.

188
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,304
Eighty-six carats?

189
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,515
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

190
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,772
A beautiful stone.

191
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,064
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

192
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,399
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

193
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,453
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

194
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,284
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Doug The Head?

195
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,035
And Franky...

196
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,788
-And what?
<i>-Stay out of those casinos.</i>

197
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,843
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

198
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,137
-Don't go screwing it up, all right?
-I <i>hear you, Avi.</i>

199
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,761
I'll see you, Avi.

200
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,261
Eighty-six karats.

201
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,188
-Where?
-London.

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,016
-London?
-London.

203
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,226
-London?
-Yes,London.

204
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,821
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

205
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,237
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

206
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,239
Not for me.

207
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,622
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

208
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,625
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

209
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,787
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

210
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,248
<i>Even tells his family
they're Jewish...</i>

211
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,756
<i>...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

212
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,972
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...</i>

213
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,596
<i>-...it is good for business.</i>
-Avi!

214
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,848
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

215
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,810
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

216
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,642
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

217
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,026
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

218
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,070
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

219
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,652
Listen to me.

220
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,197
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

221
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,371
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

222
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,837
What are you doing here?

223
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,960
It's a free country, isn't it?

224
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,043
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

225
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,170
So fuck off.

226
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,437
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

227
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,814
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

228
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,772
-You got to go see him.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,367
-He's a big mucker in New York.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

230
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,070
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

231
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,781
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

232
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,873
The weight is sign of reliability.

233
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,713
I always go for reliability.

234
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,552
I'll take it.

235
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,391
How much do you want for it?

236
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,812
Nothing.

237
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,652
Okay, so what do you want for it?

238
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,479
I want you to do something for me.

239
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,399
There is a fight in couple of days.

240
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,197
What kind of a fight?

241
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,120
Unlicensed boxing.

242
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,491
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

243
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,291
If you place one down for me...

244
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,414
...we will call it quits.

245
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,960
-Why don't you put it down yourself?
-Well...

246
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,640
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

247
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,019
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

248
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,808
I know something most don't.

249
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,147
<i>So, nu?</i>

250
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,858
What do you know?

251
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,362
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

252
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,619
-Ten points.
-What are we doing here?

253
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,706
-We're buying a caravan.
-Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

254
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,630
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

255
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,914
Not if you're here.

256
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,966
Oh, you bastard.

257
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,761
I fucking hate pikeys.

258
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,223
That's a flash car, mister.

259
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,891
Not as flash as your bike.

260
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,056
Who are you looking for?

261
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,603
Mr. O'Neil.

262
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,523
-Want me to get him?
-That's a good lad.

263
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,518
Piss off.

264
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,063
-Are you going to go get him for me?
-Yeah.

265
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,116
-What are you waiting for?
-The five quid you'll pay me.

266
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,944
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

267
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,530
-Two fifty.
-You can have a quid.

268
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,365
You're a real tight fucker.

269
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,454
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

270
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,585
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

271
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,666
<i>You can't understand
what's being said.</i>

272
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,464
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

273
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,958
-Mr. O'Neil.
-Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

274
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,794
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

275
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,254
-How are you?
-Weather's been kind.

276
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,223
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

277
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,593
Would you look at the size of him?

278
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,677
How big are you?

279
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,854
-Kids, how big is he?
-Big, for sure.

280
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,808
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

281
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,276
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

282
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,116
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

283
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,692
I could murder one.

284
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,950
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

285
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,202
Get your hands out of there.

286
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,075
Cup of tea for the big fella?

287
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,416
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

288
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,123
You little bugger.

289
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,551
-Is the big fella not coming with us?
-He's minding the car.

290
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,596
-What does he think we are, thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

291
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,929
-He just likes looking after cars.
-Good dags. Do you like dags?

292
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,969
-Dags?
-What?

293
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,891
-Yeah, dags.
-Dags. You like dags?

294
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,185
Oh, dogs.

295
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,517
Sure, I like dags.

296
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,570
-I like caravans more.
-You're very welcome.

297
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,206
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

298
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,454
<i>It's probably why
they talk like that...</i>

299
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,831
...so <i>you can't follow
what's being said.</i>

300
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,544
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...</i>

301
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,136
<i>...on his return
there will be ice cream.</i>

302
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,677
Good dog, good family.

303
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,635
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

304
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,766
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

305
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,189
All right, Mickey. Laters.

306
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,147
I don't see what the fuss is about.

307
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,149
They aren't bad fellas.

308
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,578
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

309
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,912
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

310
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,004
See that car? Use it.

311
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,880
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

312
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,095
Nobody brings you...

313
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,219
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

314
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,143
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

315
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,389
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

316
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,771
-You want to settle this with a fight?
-Over my dead body.

317
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,359
Now, go on! Go on!

318
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,572
I'll not have you fighting! You know
what happens when you fight!

319
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,570
Get her to sit down.

320
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,902
For fuck's sake!

321
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,830
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

322
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,625
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

323
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,970
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

324
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,389
You want to stay down.

325
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,857
You want to stay down!

326
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,405
Get back down
and fucking stay down.

327
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,071
I promise you,
you want to stay down.

328
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,406
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

329
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,658
Cheeky bastard.

330
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,417
-Okay, lads.
-Get him on his feet.

331
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,969
Get back down...

332
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,010
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

333
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,427
Bollocks to you.

334
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,888
This is sick. I'm out of here.

335
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,644
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

336
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,899
You stay until the job's done.

337
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,649
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...</i>

338
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,652
<i>...was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

339
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,605
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

340
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,156
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

341
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,071
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...</i>

342
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,573
<i>...Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.</i>

343
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,872
<i>Why would the gypsies
want to explain...</i>

344
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,336
<i>...why a man died in their campsite?</i>

345
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,758
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

346
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,511
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

347
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,089
<i>Tommy, "The Tit"...</i>

348
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,015
<i>...is praying.</i>

349
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,516
<i>And if he isn't...</i>

350
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,807
<i>...he fucking should be.</i>

351
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,798
Bad Boy.

352
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,050
-Sol.
-Easy.

353
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,053
No, it's a moissanite.

354
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,213
A what?

355
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,891
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

356
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,176
It's Mickey Mouse.

357
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,178
Spurious.

358
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,389
Not genuine.

359
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,566
And it's worth...

360
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,059
...fuck-all.

361
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,354
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

362
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,406
Leave this game to me and Sol.

363
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,075
Laters.

364
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:37,989
What is that, Vince?

365
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,915
This is a dog, Sol.

366
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,376
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

367
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,249
It's only a fucking dog.

368
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,088
-Where'd you get it?
-The gyppos.

369
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,419
Here.

370
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,669
They threw it in with the moody gold.

371
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,428
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

372
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,057
It better not be dangerous.

373
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,058
What do you think you're doing now?

374
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,311
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

375
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,943
Stop the dog!

376
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,353
Come back!

377
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,446
All right, Boris?

378
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,447
-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.

379
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,328
What can I do for you?

380
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,831
I have a job for you.

381
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,784
I already have a job.

382
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,504
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

383
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,881
Go on.

384
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,427
I want you to hold up a bookies.

385
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,970
From Russia with love, eh?

386
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,099
I have stones to sell...

387
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,432
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

388
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,233
...so if I am not rushing you...

389
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,279
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

390
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,816
I am not in Rome, Doug.

391
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,776
I am in a rush.

392
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,660
I got to make the bookies.

393
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,992
Bookies?

394
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,332
-What are you betting on?
-Bomber Harris.

395
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,494
The unlicensed boxer?

396
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,249
Do you know something that I don't?

397
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:16,429
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

398
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,349
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

399
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,801
Of course I am.

400
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,855
Tyrone will drive for us.
He's done a rally driving course.

401
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,306
Of course I have.

402
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,903
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

403
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,651
Your seats?

404
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,154
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

405
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,326
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

406
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,949
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

407
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,081
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

408
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,037
It went back to the gyppos.

409
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,998
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

410
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,510
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

411
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,378
Ask him.

412
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,343
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

413
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,426
Steady on the brakes.

414
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,932
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

415
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,024
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

416
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,725
All right?

417
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,539
What?

418
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,635
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

419
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,713
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

420
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,510
Worry about getting us a gun.

421
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,888
What's that?

422
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,400
This is a shotgun, Sol.

423
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,444
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

424
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,691
-I want to raise pulses, don't I?
-You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

425
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,386
That does not look like a bookies.

426
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,849
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter
with that space over there?

427
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,017
It's too tight.

428
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,144
Too tight?

429
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,269
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

430
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,728
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

431
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,605
Of course I am.

432
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,748
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

433
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,083
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

434
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,082
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

435
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,755
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

436
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,633
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

437
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,884
I didn't see it.

438
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,059
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

439
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,978
It was at a funny angle.

440
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,019
It's behind you, Tyrone.

441
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,693
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

442
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,654
Control that dog as well.

443
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,698
-Get that dog off him.
-Get it off me.

444
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,533
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

445
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,412
Don't snatch.

446
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,288
He can't swallow the whole ball.

447
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,338
Yeah.

448
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,884
Why the fuck...

449
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,508
...did you put Gorgeous George...

450
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,389
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

451
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,937
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

452
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,483
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

453
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,946
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

454
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,573
What the fuck did you expect?

455
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,155
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

456
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,829
Who took the jam
out of your doughnut?

457
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,540
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

458
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,162
You did.

459
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,378
You said get a good deal.

460
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,082
I fail to recognise
the correlation...

461
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,503
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

462
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,045
...and a good deal.

463
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,422
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

464
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,557
That his fight won't happen?

465
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,476
We replace the fighter.

466
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,554
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

467
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,684
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

468
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,682
What about John The Gun?

469
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,393
Or Mad Fist Willy?

470
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,854
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

471
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,110
Mad Fist went mad...

472
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,027
...and The Gun shot himself.

473
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,245
Jesus.

474
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,336
-What?
-Let's use the fucking pikey.

475
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,127
-How much you gonna pay us?
-10 K.

476
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,673
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,014
All right.

478
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,230
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:23,978
A what?

480
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,403
A caravan.

481
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,241
-Top of the range and all that.
-It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,910
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

483
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,326
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

484
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,158
Your what?

485
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,576
His ma.

486
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,197
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

487
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,905
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

488
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,531
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

489
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,239
<i>...and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

490
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,125
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...</i>

491
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,711
<i>...and aim for penetration.</i>

492
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,088
<i>If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...</i>

493
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,632
<i>...he'd want to split me in half.</i>

494
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,757
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,145
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

496
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,233
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,990
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,818
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,912
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,910
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,084
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,457
Well, where'd you lose him?

503
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,260
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

504
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,259
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

505
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,468
We're not backing out.

506
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,600
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,260
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,099
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,522
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,111
You won't know him,
but he's mustard.

511
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,522
Mustard?

512
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,364
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

513
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,031
...you can't change fighters.

514
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,454
-You've still got your fight.
-No.

515
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,867
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

516
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,954
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

517
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,918
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,796
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,382
Do you want to get bitten,
sweetheart?

520
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,436
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,022
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

522
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,814
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

523
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,316
<i>In his debt.</i>

524
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,156
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

525
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,239
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,161
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,660
Now, fuck off.

528
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,176
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

529
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,555
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

530
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,383
-When later?
-He said he wanted cash.

531
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,677
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

532
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,606
A fight?

533
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:56,191
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,070
-Is there gambling involved?
-It's a boxing match, Avi.

535
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,872
-Did he have a case with him?
-Yes, he had a case.

536
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,791
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,709
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

538
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,543
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

539
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,879
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

540
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,712
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,296
I have no idea.

542
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,721
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,428
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

544
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,812
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

545
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,477
I'm sure he can pay.

546
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,477
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,070
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

548
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,825
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,666
I don't like leaving my own country...

550
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,084
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,837
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,381
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,463
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:04,641
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,185
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,430
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,442
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,435
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,945
Will he be all right?

560
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,438
I hope not.

561
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,901
-Are we gonna rob this bookies?
-Yes, big man.

562
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,284
Why are we waiting?

563
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,993
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,157
And why's that?

565
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:33,291
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,996
What's in the case?

567
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,505
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

568
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,303
Jesus.

569
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,808
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-I'm well aware of that, my son.

570
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,718
That's why we're here.

571
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,721
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,974
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,024
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-We know. That's why we're here.

574
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,813
Tickets.

575
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,490
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,569
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,663
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

578
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,742
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

579
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,835
I'm looking for Franky.

580
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,506
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

581
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,589
-If there's gambling, he'll be here.
-Let's not have a fuck-up.

582
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,176
You won't let us down.

583
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,344
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

584
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,178
Is that him?

585
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,514
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

586
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,854
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

587
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,857
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the Show.

588
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,878
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,961
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything--

590
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,054
What are you doing?

591
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,725
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

592
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,763
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,273
Drop the screen now.

594
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,687
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,318
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

596
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,571
-Fill that bag.
-All bets are off.

597
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,579
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,996
Appreciated...

599
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,119
...but all bets...

600
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,084
...are...

601
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,458
...off.

602
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,841
If all bets are off, there can't be
any money, can there?

603
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,716
I ain't fucking buying that.

604
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,432
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

605
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,801
What have you got?

606
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,188
Nothing, really.

607
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,770
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,604
Show me your hands.

609
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,448
You've got five fingers.

610
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,779
Copper coins.

611
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,662
What do you mean,
copper fucking coins?

612
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,299
It won't open
because it's a security door.

613
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,634
Hold that.

614
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,102
My leg.

615
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,564
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

616
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,498
We're fucked.

617
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,874
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,421
Get us out of here.

619
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,055
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,528
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,164
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

622
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,871
In the red corner...

623
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,628
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

624
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,129
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,044
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

626
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,139
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,508
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,635
...Mickey!

629
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,064
And in the other corner...

630
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,354
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker--

631
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,487
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

632
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:17,572
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

633
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,367
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,079
Let's get ready...

635
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,418
...to rumble!

636
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,663
Do you realise I'm
fucking forty grand down?

637
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,085
What's the fucking crack?

638
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,005
-I'll make it up to you.
-I ain't happy.

639
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,671
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,005
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

641
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,883
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,061
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,188
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

644
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,148
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking Jacobs off.

645
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,801
-He's here.
-Well, you explain it to him.

646
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,728
-What you doing?
-The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,355
So why didn't you chop it off?

648
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,857
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

649
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,484
But he has the case.

650
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,358
Look, we--
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,866
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

652
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,985
Okay.

653
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,863
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,158
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,997
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,042
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,592
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,721
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

659
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,718
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

660
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,431
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

661
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,852
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,775
Watch out!

663
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,954
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,538
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,298
Give me the stone.

666
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,877
-It's in the case.
-What?

667
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,254
It's in the case.

668
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,135
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,142
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,390
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,806
Now, <i>it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

672
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:10,057
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

673
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,937
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

674
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,816
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

675
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,824
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

676
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,821
<i>Once I have that, it's--</i>

677
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,152
Oink, oink.

678
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,992
Shit.

679
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,125
So that's where you keep the sugar.

680
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,001
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,462
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

682
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,968
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

683
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,304
No, we don't, John.

684
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,736
I just had them polished.

685
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,868
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,701
-You take sugar?
-No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,377
I'm sweet enough.

688
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,179
He is now your problem.

689
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:29,841
Okay?

690
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:42,066
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,528
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

692
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,070
Well, look at him.

693
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:00,293
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,873
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,838
All right. Of course.

696
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,295
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,048
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

698
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,217
But this time...

699
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:16,847
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,818
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,077
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,037
So now you can open it.

703
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,713
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,711
I think he's got away with enough.

705
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:49,008
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

706
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,176
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,267
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,760
Find them today.

709
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,248
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,159
Tommy.

711
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,709
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

712
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,211
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,919
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yeah.

714
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,172
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,803
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

716
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,308
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

717
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,272
He's coursing.

718
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,360
What's coursing?

719
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,565
Hare coursing.

720
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:52,366
<i>They set two “Archers-
They're dogs, before you ask.</i>

721
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,820
On a hare.

722
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,539
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,833
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,667
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

725
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,885
Proper fucked?

726
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,925
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,506
Before "zee" Germans get there.

728
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,560
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,225
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,391
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

731
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:25,813
John?

732
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,315
I can't help, guv.

733
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,491
Tyrone.

734
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,570
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,915
-Do you want to do it?
-That depends.

736
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,075
On what?

737
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,211
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,835
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,591
-It's not the same caravan.
-Not the same fight.

740
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,752
It's twice the size of the last one.

741
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,005
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,217
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

743
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:03,522
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

744
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,979
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

745
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,860
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

746
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,400
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,541
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

748
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,248
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,674
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

750
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,216
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,105
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,230
I'll tell you what.

753
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,112
Fucker.

754
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,198
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,736
You'll what?

756
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,317
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,779
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

758
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,489
I'll do you a favour.

759
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,417
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,745
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,627
<i>“Hose...</i>

762
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,841
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

763
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,638
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is beta pikey.</i>

764
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,015
<i>However, [don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

765
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,891
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if! lose...</i>

766
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,352
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

767
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,485
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,691
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,657
You got that, London?

770
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,908
We're on!

771
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,026
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,403
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

773
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,127
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,507
Who's proper fucked now, then?

775
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,306
There's something very wrong
with this.

776
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,806
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:38,194
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

778
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,940
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

779
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,651
What? You saying I can't shoot?

780
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,454
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

781
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,539
I know you can't shoot.

782
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,957
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

783
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,337
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,085
You saying the gun don't work?

785
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,674
You tried it?

786
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:06,964
Whoops.

787
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,519
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,477
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

789
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,604
To keep his head warm.

790
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,312
-What happened to him?
-He got shot in the face.

791
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,028
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,611
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

793
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,285
-What do you want me to do?
-Sort it out.

794
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,363
-I'm not a witch doctor.
-But you are a bad boy yardie...

795
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,449
...and bad boy yardies should
know how to get rid of bodies.

796
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,457
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

797
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,593
We're in, governor.

798
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,381
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,967
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:53,936
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,015
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

802
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:10,115
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,409
Do you know who I am?

804
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,253
I do.

805
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,256
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,471
Well, I don't.

807
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,689
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

808
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,149
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:53,033
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,574
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,832
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,540
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

813
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,887
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,556
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:20,015
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,061
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,816
...for the piggies' digestion.

818
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,319
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,110
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

820
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,994
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:41,294
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:45,541
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,968
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,132
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,009
That means that a single pig...

826
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,934
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,303
...every minute.

828
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,764
Hence the expression...

829
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,359
<i>...“as greedy as 3 mg.“</i>

830
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,447
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

831
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:16,871
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

832
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,040
...apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

833
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,213
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

834
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,005
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

835
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:37,930
...manifested by an
appropriate agent."

836
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:43,060
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,061
Me.

838
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,241
Gentlemen...

839
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,942
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

840
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:32,981
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

841
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,782
What about Tony?

842
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,239
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

843
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,402
Who's Bullet-Tooth--?

844
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,696
-Tony!
-You silly fuck.

845
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,955
He's a liability.

846
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,366
He'd find Moses
and the burning bush.

847
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,042
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:49,542
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

849
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,128
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,169
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,089
Why don't you fucking die?

852
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,008
-He's the best chance you got.
-Six times?

853
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,973
In one sitting.

854
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,517
You're in trouble now.

855
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,400
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:23,993
<i>Bonjour.</i>

857
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,836
What's so fucking important?

858
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,289
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

859
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,342
-...missing an arm in our office?
-Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,344
You give us four days...

861
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,257
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

862
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,675
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,187
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,639
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,525
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,316
-You got 48 hours.
-Yeah.

867
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,865
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

868
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,316
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,030
After that it's your family...

870
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,121
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

871
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:10,503
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

872
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,379
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

873
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,042
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

874
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,967
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,258
Forty thousand.

876
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,763
Where was he last seen?

877
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,636
At a bookies.

878
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,559
Bookies?

879
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,684
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,817
-Bookies got blagged last night.
-Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:45,781
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,406
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,999
We'll see a man
that may know something.

884
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,998
I need a gun.

885
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,338
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

886
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,211
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,554
He's stained for fucking life.

888
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,516
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell--

889
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,092
All right, Mullet?

890
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,811
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:15,939
Nice tie.

892
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,899
I heard you weren't about that much.

893
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:21,316
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,738
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,070
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

896
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,616
-Do me a favour, Tone.
-I will do you a favour, Mullet.

897
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,624
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

898
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,082
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,966
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,265
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

901
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,310
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,596
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,433
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,691
-What you think I'm doing?
-Well, don't, Tone.

905
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,781
You been using dog shit
for tooth paste?

906
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,279
Slow down, Tone.

907
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,618
Slow down, Tony!

908
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,413
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

909
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,958
Play some music if you like.

910
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,203
I love this track.

911
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,082
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

912
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,796
Yes, Mullet?

913
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:27,306
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawnshop in Smith Street.

914
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,341
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,140
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

916
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,766
It's very effective, Tony.

917
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,065
It's not too subtle, but effective.

918
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,109
Are we taking him with us?

919
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,532
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

920
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:55,709
A Russian?

921
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,538
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

922
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,338
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

923
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,837
-Give me a name.
-Yurinov.

924
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,462
Boris.

925
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,556
-Boris The Blade?
-Yeah.

926
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,676
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,647
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,979
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,855
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...</i>

930
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,694
<i>...and you nicked all our savings.</i>

931
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:31,199
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:36,037
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

933
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,620
-Are you taking the piss?
<i>-What</i> can <i>I</i> do?

934
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,045
I can't make him do it, can I?

935
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,421
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

936
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:53,468
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

937
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,058
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,752
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...</i>

939
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,048
<i>...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

940
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,008
<i>And if that wasn't enough...</i>

941
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,174
<i>...he thought it would be
a good idea...</i>

942
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,935
<i>...to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

943
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,142
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

944
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,448
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,991
You lot...

946
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,206
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

947
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,128
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:52,340
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

949
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,046
What?

950
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,179
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

951
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,110
Jesus.

952
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,949
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,660
Did you do it?

954
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,255
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,967
-What are you two doing here?
-Come back!

956
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,045
-You got some tars on you.
-Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,339
Fuck off!

958
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,439
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

959
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,647
<i>His mum is still smoking
next to us...</i>

960
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,945
<i>...and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

961
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:56,029
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

962
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,364
<i>And if he'd said no...</i>

963
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,950
<i>...it could've been
a shite sight worse.</i>

964
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,545
Russians.

965
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,426
Russians.

966
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,128
I should've known.

967
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:21,266
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,560
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,808
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,770
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,226
He'll be impossible to track down.

972
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,273
Yeah.

973
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,903
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.</i>

974
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,655
-Where's <i>he</i> from?
<i>-I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

975
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,445
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

976
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,462
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,223
That sneaky Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

978
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,348
First things first. One of us...

979
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:10,478
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

980
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,146
Now.

981
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,285
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

982
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,989
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

983
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,873
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,709
Not a problem.

985
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,167
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,212
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,380
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,800
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,882
And not just any doctor, <i>boychik.</i>
A nice Jewish doctor.

990
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,225
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,975
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:57,651
-I think you got something to tell us.
-Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,152
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,780
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,660
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

996
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,536
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

997
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:13,413
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,177
-Yeah.
-Boris is here.

999
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,514
-We're coming over. Hold him there.
<i>-Hold</i> on!

1000
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,848
He's not on his own!

1001
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,314
We're off.

1002
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,442
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,492
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,208
So, where is he?

1005
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:59,132
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1006
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,340
-They locked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us that?

1007
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,134
Did they look hard?

1008
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,639
They looked messy.

1009
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,642
-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?

1010
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,728
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,308
All right.

1012
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,225
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,148
But this time, try it.

1014
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,605
How far to the Russian's?

1015
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,406
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,782
-Come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,993
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1018
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,123
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1019
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,961
Why? What's wrong with it?

1020
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,135
-It's not in sync with evolution.
-Shut up.

1021
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:45,758
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,431
-Do you want to shoot him?
-It's a little noisy.

1023
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:51,681
-Do you want to stab him?
-That's a little cold-blooded.

1024
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,347
-Do you want to kill him or not?
-I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1025
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,977
That's the spirit.

1026
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,683
Do they fire?

1027
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,192
Of course they fire.

1028
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,604
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1029
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,773
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,071
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,497
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:18,629
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1033
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,381
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:25,294
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1035
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,884
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,592
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:35,770
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1038
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,065
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,192
Let me do you a favour.

1040
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,315
Whoops.

1041
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,983
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,365
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1043
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,784
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1044
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,082
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1045
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,878
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,397
Is that Boris?

1047
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,956
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,791
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,802
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,638
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,227
They're getting out.

1052
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,435
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,683
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,268
You're making a scene.

1055
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,108
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1056
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,449
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,326
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1058
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,410
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,959
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1060
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,920
-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1061
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,595
Should we go in?

1062
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:37,267
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1063
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,559
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:45,275
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1065
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,441
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1066
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:52,399
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1067
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,658
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,620
Well, come on then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1069
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,122
You just tell him who's in charge.

1070
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,333
Boris--

1071
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,839
You certainly told him.

1072
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,895
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,645
Come and pick us up. And Doug...

1074
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,406
...sharpish.

1075
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:56,463
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1076
01:13:56,724 --> 01:14:00,342
...but unless you give me what
I want, there will be fucking murders.

1077
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,095
What's your name?

1078
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:05,972
Shoot him.

1079
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,025
Let go of the gun!

1080
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,288
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1081
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,921
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1082
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,041
There are two types of balls:

1083
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:37,762
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1084
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,466
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1085
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,301
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1086
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,062
...but they're not clever.

1087
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:49,642
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1088
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,820
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1089
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,324
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1090
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:01,069
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1091
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,409
There's no pussy here...

1092
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:08,827
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1093
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,246
Like a prick...

1094
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,798
...you're having second thoughts.

1095
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,675
You're shrinking.

1096
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,221
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1097
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,809
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1098
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:34,524
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...

1099
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,985
...written on the side of mine...

1100
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,655
...should precipitate...

1101
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:50,668
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1102
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,046
Now...

1103
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,217
...fuck off.

1104
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,067
Look the door.

1105
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,648
Look it!

1106
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,822
Give me the case.

1107
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,204
Fuck you.

1108
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,198
Shoot me.

1109
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,658
I will. I'll shoot you.

1110
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:43,763
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1111
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,219
You know what?

1112
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,550
Fuck you too.

1113
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:51,437
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be
doing me a favour, you Russian fuck.

1114
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,391
You! Drop guns.

1115
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:55,937
Fuck you!

1116
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,149
You drop your gun!

1117
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,779
Okay.

1118
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,861
Avi...

1119
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,196
...pull your socks up!

1120
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:21,001
-Tyrone?
-Fuck it. We're out of here.

1121
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,720
Give me case.

1122
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,642
Avi...

1123
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,903
-...where's the case?
-Put the gun away.

1124
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,152
What's Boris doing here?

1125
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,243
Boris, what are you doing here?

1126
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,445
Fuck you!

1127
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:59,459
Where's the case?

1128
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,502
-You piece of crap.
-Don't take the piss, Boris.

1129
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,928
I'll show you.

1130
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,058
Fuck you!

1131
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,889
Almost had it.

1132
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,934
For fuck's sake.

1133
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,193
Fuck you and all.

1134
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,527
You lucky bastard.

1135
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,789
Jeez, it's flawless.

1136
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,252
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1137
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,711
Leave the dog here.

1138
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:47,797
-Sol, why don't we just leave?
-Because life's too short, Vincent...

1139
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,890
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1140
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,386
-Now leave that dog here.
-I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1141
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,724
Don't worry about it!

1142
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:59,607
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1143
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,484
It's okay.

1144
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,071
Sit down. Down.

1145
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,117
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1146
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,615
Well, we won't if you don't.

1147
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,455
All right, you give me the stone...

1148
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,588
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1149
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,968
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1150
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,094
Why is it down there?

1151
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:36,060
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1152
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,179
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1153
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:42,271
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1154
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:46,278
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1155
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:52,903
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1156
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,614
What have they got to do
with anything?

1157
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,120
They're both staring straight at me.

1158
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:05,465
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1159
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:06,965
Now, out of the car.

1160
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,468
And leave your water pistols behind.

1161
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:14,015
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1162
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,800
I'll think of something.

1163
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:21,727
Why's he sweating?

1164
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:24,979
Oh, never mind.

1165
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,937
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1166
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:32,279
-I'm a little worried, actually.
-Worried about what?

1167
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,696
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1168
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,994
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1169
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,287
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1170
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:47,962
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1171
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,797
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1172
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,299
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1173
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,182
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1174
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,850
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1175
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:09,521
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1176
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,861
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1177
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,823
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1178
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,279
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1179
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:21,708
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1180
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,870
So why are you so calm?

1181
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,207
-I said--
-I heard What you said, Tommy!

1182
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,676
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1183
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,838
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1184
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,560
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1185
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,392
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1186
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,934
Oh, that fucking dog!

1187
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,892
Go on, get the dog.

1188
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,066
-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
-Open a window.

1189
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,489
You people live like animals.

1190
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,666
Now, where's the stone?

1191
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,123
-Come on, where is it?
-It's over here.

1192
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:51,456
-Where? Where?
-I left it in a box.

1193
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:57,798
It's empty.

1194
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,091
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1195
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,139
No, I'm being serious!

1196
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,975
The dog. The dog must have ate it.

1197
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,986
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1198
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,986
-What?
-Look in the dog.

1199
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,411
-You mean, "look in the dog"?
-I mean, open him up.

1200
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:30,002
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1201
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,209
You know what I mean.

1202
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:35,836
That's a bit strong.

1203
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:38,919
I don't know about this.

1204
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,131
No, you can't do this.

1205
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,301
It's fucking squeaking!

1206
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,565
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1207
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:54,814
I'm shooting the dog!

1208
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,821
Shoot the fucking dog!

1209
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:18,342
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1210
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,355
Thank God for that.

1211
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,077
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1212
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,748
Tony, come on!

1213
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,291
Tony?

1214
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,394
-Anything to declare?
-Yeah. Don't go to England.

1215
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:20,817
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1216
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,232
How's the dog
gonna find the campsite?

1217
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,534
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1218
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:28,909
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1219
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,081
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1220
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:34,627
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1221
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:40,004
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1222
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,511
Mickey.

1223
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,761
Mickey!

1224
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,269
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1225
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:56,269
Need a drink.

1226
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,356
You can't give him a drink!

1227
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,647
It's not for him. It's for me.

1228
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,287
Ah, mates. Amen.

1229
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:21,712
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1230
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,043
All right, Mickey?

1231
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,170
Mickey!

1232
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,468
Need to have a shite!

1233
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:38,016
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1234
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,685
...shoot the bastards.

1235
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,489
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1236
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,997
All right, Tom.

1237
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:58,620
-Hope we get a better show this time.
-This will make up for it.

1238
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:01,547
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1239
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,341
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1240
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,130
Now, you have to forgive me.

1241
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:09,088
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1242
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:15,344
-Our lads at the campsite?
-They're over there now.

1243
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:20,899
I fucking hate pikeys.

1244
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:26,735
-How long have we gotta stay here?
-As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1245
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,775
Fucking hate pikeys.

1246
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,903
Is he fucking stoned?

1247
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,406
He's like that before a fight.

1248
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:38,083
Do you know
when you're going down?

1249
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,870
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1250
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:45,378
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1251
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,211
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1252
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,888
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1253
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,433
-Not now.
-Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1254
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,557
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to war.

1255
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,263
And they're none of yours.

1256
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:04,443
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1257
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:08,067
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1258
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,450
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1259
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,952
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1260
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,506
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1261
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,886
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1262
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,421
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1263
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,419
Talk about saved by the bell.

1264
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:39,510
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1265
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:42,013
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1266
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,351
All right, let's break it up.

1267
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,810
What, is he fucking deaf?

1268
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,018
What is he doing?

1269
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,156
Come on and sit.

1270
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,911
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1271
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,247
You're dancing like a fairy.

1272
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,170
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1273
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:59,090
Get out there and hurt him.

1274
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:05,388
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1275
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,596
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1276
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,356
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1277
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,608
He can't stand up.

1278
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:45,818
We're out of here.

1279
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:51,035
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...</i>

1280
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,458
<i>...sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1281
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:58,915
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1282
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,426
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1283
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,094
Give me that fucking shooter!

1284
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,843
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1285
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,220
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1286
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,893
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1287
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:15,139
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...</i>

1288
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,983
<i>...because you're too scared
to think.</i>

1289
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,316
<i>You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.</i>

1290
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,776
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1291
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,825
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1292
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,326
<i>It had previously occurred to</i> me...

1293
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,537
<i>...that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1294
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:41,086
<i>For every action,
there is a reaction.</i>

1295
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,212
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1296
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,252
<i>...is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1297
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,345
Pete, talk to me.

1298
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:33,175
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1299
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:45,734
-Give me that fucking shooter.
-I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1300
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:57,415
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1301
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,912
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1302
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,423
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1303
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,756
<i>...while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1304
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:13,424
<i>We're worse off now than
when we started.</i>

1305
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,432
<i>The next day we went
to the campsite...</i>

1306
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,772
<i>...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1307
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,979
<i>Which was probably a good thing...</i>

1308
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:31,492
<i>...considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1309
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,319
Where is he?

1310
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,779
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1311
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,037
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1312
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:43,587
<i>You won't find 3 mm»; that
doesn't want to be found.</i>

1313
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,709
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1314
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:52,137
Bollocks! Come on.

1315
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:00,558
-What you doing here?
-What's it got to do with you?

1316
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,230
So, what you doing here?

1317
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:17,071
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1318
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:19,659
What's in the car?

1319
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,784
Seats and a steering wheel.

1320
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,460
What do you know about gypsies?

1321
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,206
I know they're not to be trusted.

1322
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,003
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1323
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,342
Get the dog, Tommy.

1324
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:38,721
The dog.

1325
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:44,561
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1326
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,358
He loves that dog.

1327
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:49,360
Always playing silly games.

1328
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,023
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1329
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:59,579
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1330
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,875
Could you tell me...

1331
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:15,387
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1332
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,047
Hey, George...

1333
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,600
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1334
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,473
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1335
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,910
<i>Tommy persuaded me
to keep the dog.</i>

1336
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:42,410
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1337
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,496
<i>I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.</i>

1338
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:49,166
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...</i>

1339
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:52,758
<i>...and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1340
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:55,794
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1341
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,171
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1342
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,761
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1343
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:04,053
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1344
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,933
So, what do you think?

1345
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,854
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1346
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:15,647
I might.
