1
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismount!</font>

2
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herman's horse-sick!</font>

3
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaps, no one wander off.</font>

4
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.</font>

5
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
this is such a good idea.</font>

6
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

7
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alfred, did you get anything yet?</font>

8
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nothing.
- Then keep digging.</font>

9
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid's got something!</font>

10
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something, Garth!
I got something...</font>

11
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something right here.</font>

12
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look at that!</font>

13
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.</font>

14
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we're rich, ain't we?</font>

15
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:31,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy...</font>

16
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy?</font>

17
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they doing?</font>

18
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana? Indiana?</font>

19
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.</font>

20
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Cross of Coronado.</font>

21
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cortez gave it to him in 1520.</font>

22
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy!</font>

23
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama, dig down</font>

24
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and put it on her bony finger!</font>

25
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.</font>

26
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run back and find the others.</font>

27
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.</font>

28
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have him bring the sheriff.</font>

29
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a snake.</font>

30
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what I said?</font>

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Run back...</font>

32
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...</font>

33
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, what are you gonna do?</font>

34
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

35
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll think of something.</font>

36
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.</font>

37
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got our thing!</font>

38
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get him!
- Get off me!</font>

39
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Havelock! Anybody!</font>

40
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's lost but me.</font>

41
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is! Let's go! Let's go!</font>

42
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!</font>

43
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Come back here!</font>

44
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Get him!</font>

45
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come back here!</font>

46
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me.</font>

47
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy smokes!</font>

48
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid.</font>

49
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way out of this.</font>

50
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

51
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toss up the whip.</font>

52
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.</font>

53
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It belongs to Coronado.</font>

54
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.</font>

55
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This should be in a museum.</font>

56
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now give it back!</font>

57
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A snake! Snake!</font>

58
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let him get away!</font>

59
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic?</font>

60
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it.</font>

61
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure he doesn't double back.</font>

62
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid, out of the box, now.</font>

63
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>

64
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>

65
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

66
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

67
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

68
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad...
- Out.</font>

69
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.</font>

70
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!</font>

71
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3, 4...</font>

72
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Greek.</font>

73
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."</font>

74
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought the sheriff.</font>

75
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the man I want to see.</font>

76
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there were 5 or 6 of them...</font>

77
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...</font>

78
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.</font>

79
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right here.</font>

80
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad to see that</font>

81
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.</font>

82
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got witnesses, 5 or 6 of them.</font>

83
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

84
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day.</font>

85
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost today, kid,</font>

86
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it doesn't mean you have to like it.</font>

87
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small world, Dr. Jones.</font>

88
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too small for two of us.</font>

89
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the second time
I've had to reclaim</font>

90
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:26,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my property from you.</font>

91
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That belongs in a museum.</font>

92
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do you.</font>

93
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw him over the side.</font>

94
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!</font>

95
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Archeology is the search for fact...</font>

96
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...not truth.</font>

97
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's truth you're interested in,</font>

98
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.</font>

99
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,</font>

100
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and digging up the world.</font>

101
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,</font>

102
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.</font>

103
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:49,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">70 percent of all archeology
is done in the library.</font>

104
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Research. Reading.</font>

105
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.</font>

106
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next week, Egyptology</font>

107
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:04,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.</font>

108
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,</font>

109
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the next hour and a half.</font>

110
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, I did it.</font>

111
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got it!</font>

112
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how long I've
been looking for that?</font>

113
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All your life.</font>

114
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All my life.</font>

115
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.</font>

116
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.</font>

117
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.</font>

118
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your treat.
- Yes.</font>

119
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My treat.</font>

120
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!</font>

121
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shush!Shush!</font>

122
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.</font>

123
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.</font>

124
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, you promised...</font>

125
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your appointment schedule,</font>

126
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and these term papers
still haven't been graded.</font>

127
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,</font>

128
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get the order they arrived...</font>

129
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.</font>

130
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:20,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...And I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.</font>

131
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Venice, Italy</font>

132
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones!</font>

133
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones?</font>

134
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>

135
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.</font>

136
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My men didn't alarm you, I hope.</font>

137
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.</font>

138
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.</font>

139
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your contributions to the museum
over the years</font>

140
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been extremely generous.</font>

141
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.</font>

142
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.</font>

143
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a look over here.</font>

144
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might interest you.</font>

145
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.</font>

146
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early Latin text.</font>

147
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mid-12th century, I should think.</font>

148
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was our assessment, as well.</font>

149
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:08,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did this come from?</font>

150
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara</font>

151
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while excavating for copper.</font>

152
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you translate the inscription?</font>

153
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,</font>

154
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"will have a spring inside him</font>

155
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"welling up for eternal life.</font>

156
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain</font>

157
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"in the place where you dwell.</font>

158
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Across the desert
and through the mountain</font>

159
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,</font>

160
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the temple where the cup that...</font>

161
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."</font>

162
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.</font>

163
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.</font>

164
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion</font>

165
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.</font>

166
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Arthur legend.</font>

167
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard this bedtime story before.</font>

168
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eternal life, Dr. Jones!</font>

169
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.</font>

170
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.</font>

171
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An old man's dream.</font>

172
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.</font>

173
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grail lore is his hobby.</font>

174
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a teacher of medieval literature.</font>

175
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one the students hope
they don't get.</font>

176
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walter, you're neglecting your guests.</font>

177
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be along in a moment, dear.</font>

178
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard to resist, isn't it?</font>

179
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.</font>

180
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What good is it?</font>

181
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:58,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.</font>

182
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty vague.</font>

183
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you want to start looking?</font>

184
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,</font>

185
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the entire top portion is missing.</font>

186
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.</font>

187
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.</font>

188
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,</font>

189
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years</font>

190
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.</font>

191
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three brothers, to be exact.</font>

192
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard this one, as well.</font>

193
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert</font>

194
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">150 years after having found the Grail</font>

195
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and began the long journey
back to France,</font>

196
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but only one of them made it.</font>

197
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And before dying of extreme old age,</font>

198
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:46,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.</font>

199
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.</font>

200
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.</font>

201
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,</font>

202
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the knight promised
that two markers</font>

203
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that had been left behind would.</font>

204
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This tablet is one of those markers.</font>

205
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It proves the knight's story is true.</font>

206
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.</font>

207
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.</font>

208
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located</font>

209
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">within the city of Venice, Italy.</font>

210
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can now see, Dr. Jones,</font>

211
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're about to complete a great quest</font>

212
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that began almost 2,000 years ago.</font>

213
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're only one step away.</font>

214
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.</font>

215
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could be more right than you know.</font>

216
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

217
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've hit a snag.</font>

218
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.</font>

219
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,</font>

220
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.</font>

221
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.</font>

222
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.</font>

223
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.</font>

224
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you try my father?</font>

225
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We already have.</font>

226
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father is the man
who has disappeared.</font>

227
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father and I have been
friends since time began.</font>

228
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've watched you grow up, Indy.</font>

229
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've watched the two of you grow apart.</font>

230
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.</font>

231
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

232
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.</font>

233
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

234
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

235
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear God.</font>

236
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has the old fool
got himself into now?</font>

237
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.</font>

238
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

239
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:55,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's today's mail, and it's been opened.</font>

240
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mail.</font>

241
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it, Marcus.</font>

242
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Venice, Italy.</font>

243
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

244
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Dad's Grail diary.</font>

245
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.</font>

246
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.</font>

247
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is his whole life.</font>

248
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would he have sent this to me?</font>

249
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,</font>

250
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but someone must want it pretty badly.</font>

251
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe, Marcus?</font>

252
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe the Grail actually exists?</font>

253
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.</font>

254
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.</font>

255
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.</font>

256
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call Donovan, Marcus.</font>

257
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.</font>

258
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell him we'll take two</font>

259
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.</font>

260
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.</font>

261
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.</font>

262
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's at your disposal.</font>

263
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.</font>

264
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, good luck.</font>

265
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.</font>

266
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Signora? Signorina?</font>

267
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.</font>

268
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?</font>

269
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.</font>

270
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones?</font>

271
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

272
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it was you.</font>

273
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have your father's eyes.</font>

274
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.</font>

275
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.</font>

276
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.</font>

277
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Elsa Schneider.</font>

278
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do?</font>

279
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.</font>

280
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.</font>

281
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen him
so excited.</font>

282
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was as giddy as a schoolboy.</font>

283
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who? Attila the Professor?</font>

284
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.</font>

285
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freulein, will you permit me?</font>

286
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.</font>

287
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.</font>

288
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.</font>

289
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow I'll steal you another.</font>

290
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...</font>

291
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I have something to show you.</font>

292
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I left your father working in the library.</font>

293
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.</font>

294
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,</font>

295
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.</font>

296
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roman numerals.</font>

297
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here is the library.</font>

298
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't look
much like a library.</font>

299
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a converted church.</font>

300
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this case, it's the literal truth.</font>

301
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are on holy ground.</font>

302
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war</font>

303
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.</font>

304
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, please excuse me.</font>

305
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The library's closing in a few moments.</font>

306
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.</font>

307
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, I've seen this window before.</font>

308
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

309
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here, in Dad's diary.</font>

310
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see?</font>

311
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.</font>

312
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad was onto something here.</font>

313
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,</font>

314
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we still don't know what they mean.</font>

315
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad sent me this diary for a reason.</font>

316
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.</font>

317
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find something?</font>

318
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. 3, 7 and 10.</font>

319
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.</font>

320
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, I must be blind.</font>

321
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,</font>

322
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was looking for the tomb itself.</font>

323
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you get it?</font>

324
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tomb is somewhere in the library.</font>

325
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said yourself it used to be a church.</font>

326
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

327
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

328
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

329
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font>

330
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7. 10.</font>

331
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 10.</font>

332
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now where's the 10?</font>

333
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around for the 10.</font>

334
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 and 7.</font>

335
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7 and 7</font>

336
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and 10.</font>

337
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10.</font>

338
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"X" marks the spot.</font>

339
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo.</font>

340
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.</font>

341
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a great deal like your father.</font>

342
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except he's lost, and I'm not.</font>

343
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lower me down.</font>

344
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look after this for me, will you?</font>

345
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

346
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.</font>

347
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

348
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">600 years before the Crusades.</font>

349
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Christians would have
dug their own passages</font>

350
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and burial chambers centuries later.</font>

351
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

352
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,</font>

353
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's where we'll find him.</font>

354
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this one?</font>

355
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark of the Covenant.</font>

356
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.</font>

357
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out.</font>

358
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:18,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's petroleum.</font>

359
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should sink a well down here
and retire.</font>

360
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the lighter.</font>

361
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, rats.</font>

362
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

363
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

364
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it... it must be one of these.</font>

365
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the artistry
of these carvings, and the scrollwork.</font>

366
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's this one.</font>

367
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it. We found it.</font>

368
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

369
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.</font>

370
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shield is the second marker.</font>

371
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

372
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.</font>

373
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.</font>

374
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?</font>

375
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never would have
made it past the rats.</font>

376
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hates rats.</font>

377
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's scared to death of them.</font>

378
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Back against the wall.</font>

379
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Under it! Air pocket!</font>

380
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't wander off.
- What?</font>

381
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

382
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I've found a way out.</font>

383
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deep breath.</font>

384
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Venice.</font>

385
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crazy? Don't go between them!</font>

386
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go between them? Are you crazy?</font>

387
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said go around!</font>

388
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said go between them!</font>

389
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, don't go between them!</font>

390
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

391
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you trying to kill us?</font>

392
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.</font>

393
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?</font>

394
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

395
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

396
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk or you're dead.</font>

397
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, tell me!</font>

398
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me!</font>

399
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.</font>

400
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll die.</font>

401
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My soul is prepared. How's yours?</font>

402
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your last chance.</font>

403
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.</font>

404
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, where's my father?</font>

405
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.</font>

406
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

407
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Kazim.</font>

408
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why were you trying to kill me?</font>

409
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,</font>

410
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:28,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for all that time,</font>

411
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword</font>

412
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:34,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.</font>

413
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me off at this jetty.</font>

414
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:46,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?</font>

415
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it for His glory, or for yours?</font>

416
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:54,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.</font>

417
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In that case,
God be with you in your quest.</font>

418
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,</font>

419
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Austrian-German border.</font>

420
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's the head?</font>

421
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better, now I've seen this.</font>

422
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:20,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?</font>

423
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The knights of the First Crusade</font>

424
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:28,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.</font>

425
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire city was destroyed.</font>

426
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:37,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The present city of lskenderun
is built on its ruins.</font>

427
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,</font>

428
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Across the desert
and through the mountain</font>

429
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."</font>

430
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But where exactly?</font>

431
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father would know.</font>

432
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.</font>

433
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through</font>

434
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the whole history of the Grail quest.</font>

435
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:03,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A map with no names.</font>

436
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.</font>

437
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,</font>

438
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the river led
into the mountains, here.</font>

439
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight to the canyon.</font>

440
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew everything
except where to begin,</font>

441
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the name of the city.</font>

442
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alexandretta.</font>

443
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now we know.
- Yes. Now we know.</font>

444
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in lskenderun.</font>

445
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?</font>

446
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after Dad.</font>

447
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:52,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa?</font>

448
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa? Elsa?</font>

449
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My room...
- Mine, too.</font>

450
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were they looking for?</font>

451
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This.</font>

452
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Grail diary?
- Uh-huh.</font>

453
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had it?</font>

454
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't trust me.</font>

455
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you.</font>

456
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I let you tag along.</font>

457
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

458
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.</font>

459
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:37,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knock it off. You're not mad.</font>

460
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

461
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You like the way I do things.</font>

462
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's lucky I don't do things the same way.</font>

463
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!</font>

464
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, what do you think
is going on here?</font>

465
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,</font>

466
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.</font>

467
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.</font>

468
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.</font>

469
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things</font>

470
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:05,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the way I think they should be done.</font>

471
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you kiss me!</font>

472
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:20,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.</font>

473
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I hate arrogant men.</font>

474
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:36,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Venice.</font>

475
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know about this place?</font>

476
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.</font>

477
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do?</font>

478
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:20,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know. I'll think of something.</font>

479
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

480
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:30,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not before time!</font>

481
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?</font>

482
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:34,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're drenched!</font>

483
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:38,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.</font>

484
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you expected?</font>

485
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:43,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.</font>

486
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald</font>

487
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant</font>

488
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are here to view the tapestries.</font>

489
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tapestries?</font>

490
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:53,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear me, the man is dense.</font>

491
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?</font>

492
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a castle,</font>

493
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we have many tapestries.</font>

494
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:06,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey Mouse!</font>

495
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare he?</font>

496
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:39,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nazis. I hate these guys.</font>

497
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:54,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one. I think he's in here.</font>

498
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:55,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know?</font>

499
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's wired.</font>

500
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy? lndy?</font>

501
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:30,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. This is kid's play.</font>

502
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back.</font>

503
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior?</font>

504
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

505
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is you, Junior!</font>

506
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me that, please.</font>

507
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are you doing here?</font>

508
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came to get you. What do you thi...</font>

509
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.</font>

510
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:23,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It breaks the heart.</font>

511
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the head. You hit me, Dad.</font>

512
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll never forgive myself.</font>

513
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, I'm fine.</font>

514
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God.</font>

515
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fake.</font>

516
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, you can tell by the cross section.</font>

517
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:46,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

518
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.</font>

519
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry
about your head, though,</font>

520
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I thought you were one of them.</font>

521
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, they come in through the doors.</font>

522
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good point.</font>

523
00:48:58,312 --> 00:48:59,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But better safe than sorry.</font>

524
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I was wrong this time.</font>

525
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:05,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.</font>

526
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:06,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You obviously got it.</font>

527
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it, and I used it.</font>

528
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found the entrance
to the catacombs.</font>

529
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:16,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the library?</font>

530
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

531
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>

532
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the tomb of Sir Richard?</font>

533
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:27,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found it</font>

534
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:31,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was actually there?</font>

535
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw him?</font>

536
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what was left of him.</font>

537
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his shield,</font>

538
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:43,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?</font>

539
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:45,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Alexandretta."</font>

540
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alexandretta! Of course!</font>

541
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:52,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.</font>

542
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior, you did it.</font>

543
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dad. You did.</font>

544
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">40 years.</font>

545
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only I could have been with you.</font>

546
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were rats, Dad.</font>

547
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:08,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rats?</font>

548
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, big ones.</font>

549
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?</font>

550
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They wanted my diary.
- Yeah?</font>

551
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:19,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.</font>

552
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:23,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

553
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>

554
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:30,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

555
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will take the book now.</font>

556
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What book?</font>

557
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the diary in your pocket.</font>

558
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dolt!</font>

559
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think my son
would be that stupid</font>

560
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?</font>

561
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't, did you?</font>

562
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You didn't bring it, did you?
- Well...</font>

563
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

564
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, can we discuss this later?</font>

565
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.</font>

566
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:04,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you take it easy?</font>

567
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy?</font>

568
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?</font>

569
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it wouldn't fall into their hands!</font>

570
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came here to save you!</font>

571
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:13,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

572
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:15,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?</font>

573
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you...</font>

574
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...don't call me Junior!</font>

575
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what you did!</font>

576
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe what you did...</font>

577
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa? Elsa?</font>

578
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:41,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.</font>

579
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down the gun, or the Freulein dies.</font>

580
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!</font>

581
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's a Nazi.
- What?</font>

582
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Trust me.
-Indy,no!</font>

583
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will kill her!</font>

584
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!</font>

585
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. He won't.</font>

586
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, please! Do what he says!</font>

587
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't listen to her.</font>

588
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough! She dies!</font>

589
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:03,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Wait...</font>

590
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

591
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't be.</font>

592
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:31,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you should have
listened to your father.</font>

593
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.</font>

594
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know she was a Nazi?</font>

595
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:00,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know she was a Nazi?</font>

596
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:03,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She talks in her sleep.</font>

597
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't trust her. Why did you?</font>

598
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:18,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he didn't take my advice.</font>

599
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:26,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donovan.</font>

600
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?</font>

601
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:33,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I misjudged you, Walter.</font>

602
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:36,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,</font>

603
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:39,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul</font>

604
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:41,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the slime of humanity.</font>

605
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Schneider,</font>

606
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:48,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are pages torn out of this.</font>

607
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This book contained a map,
a map with no names,</font>

608
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">precise directions from the unknown city</font>

609
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.</font>

610
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it did.</font>

611
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are these missing pages,
this map?</font>

612
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must have these pages back.</font>

613
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wasting your breath.</font>

614
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't tell us,</font>

615
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he doesn't have to.</font>

616
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.</font>

617
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's given them to Marcus Brody.</font>

618
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:21,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus?</font>

619
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?</font>

620
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not up to the challenge.</font>

621
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sticks out like a sore thumb.</font>

622
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll find him.</font>

623
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell you will.</font>

624
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a 2-day head start on you,</font>

625
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is more than he needs.</font>

626
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brody's got friends
in every town and village</font>

627
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:37,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from here to the Sudan.</font>

628
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.</font>

629
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll blend in, disappear.</font>

630
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never see him again.</font>

631
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.</font>

632
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone here speak English?</font>

633
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:50,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or even ancient Greek?</font>

634
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water? No, thank you, sir.</font>

635
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Fish make love in it.</font>

636
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.</font>

637
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I really don't want...</font>

638
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, thank you very much.</font>

639
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.</font>

640
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?</font>

641
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Brody!</font>

642
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah. What a relief.</font>

643
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus Brody, sir.</font>

644
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.</font>

645
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A slight detour.</font>

646
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:15,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are on your own?</font>

647
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:18,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.</font>

648
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?</font>

649
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.
But where are we going?</font>

650
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This map will show you.</font>

651
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was drawn by...</font>

652
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Brody.</font>

653
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,911

of the Museum of Antiquities</font>

655

656
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,583

659
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,006

662
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papers? Of course.</font>

663
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,722

- Yes.</font>

664
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Papers. Got it here.</font>

665
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just finished reading it myself.</font>

666
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,519

00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,357

is requested at the highest level.</font>

677
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:50,700

I will meet you at lskenderun.</font>

ahead of schedule.</font>

680
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.</font>

682
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,335

the pages from Brody,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both wanted the Grail.</font>

688
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have done anything to get it.</font>

689
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would have done the same.</font>

690
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry you think so.</font>

691
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't forget how wonderful it was.</font>

692
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

693
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was rather wonderful.</font>

00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Schneider.</font>

695
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:56,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your car is waiting.</font>

696
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:06,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how Austrians say good-bye.</font>

697
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:17,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.</font>

701
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:33,845

before the Nazis do.</font>

702
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:37,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said he had 2 days start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.</font>

703
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding? I made that up.</font>

704
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:42,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.</font>

705
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:47,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?</font>

706
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I looking for?</font>

707
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My lucky charm.</font>

708
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feels like a cigarette lighter.</font>

709
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try and burn through the ropes.</font>

710
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good.</font>

711
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:26,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ought to tell you something.</font>

712
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get sentimental now, Dad.
Save it till we get out of here.</font>

713
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The floor's on fire.</font>

714
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See?
- What?</font>

715
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:34,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the chair.</font>

716
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move it out of here! Go!</font>

717
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's scorching the table! Fast!</font>

718
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:40,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move!
- Okay!</font>

719

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alarm!</font>

732
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is intolerable.</font>

733
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm out, Dad.</font>

734
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, boy.</font>

735
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad.</font>

736
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:15,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead end.</font>

737
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:16,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's got to be a...</font>

738
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A secret door or a...</font>

739
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:20,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Passageway or something.</font>

740
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:23,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find that if I just sit down and think...</font>

741
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:28,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

742
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...The solution presents itself.</font>

743
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:45,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. More boats.</font>

744
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:51,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?</font>

745
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:56,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! But better than most.</font>

746
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:00,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Come on.</font>

747
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:02,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the boat?</font>

748
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going on the boat?</font>

749
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones!</font>

750
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halt! Halt!</font>

751
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop!
- What?</font>

752
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:40,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop!</font>

753
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.</font>

754
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:45,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brody's this way.</font>

755
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My diary's in Berlin.</font>

756
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:49,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need the diary, Dad.</font>

757
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus has the map.</font>

758
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:54,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is more in the diary
than just the map.</font>

759
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:57,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Dad. Tell me.</font>

760
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:03,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.</font>

761
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What final challenge?</font>

762
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three devices of such lethal cunning.</font>

763
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Booby traps?
- Oh, yes.</font>

764
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:15,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,</font>

765
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.</font>

766
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are they?</font>

767
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:24,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you remember?</font>

768
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:30,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.</font>

769
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half the German army's on our tail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?</font>

770
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Into the lion's den?
- Yes.</font>

771
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing that matters is the Grail.</font>

772
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Marcus?</font>

773
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus would agree with me.</font>

774
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two selfless martyrs.</font>

775
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>

776
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for blasphemy.</font>

777
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:58,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The quest for the Grail
is not archeology.</font>

778
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a race against evil.</font>

779
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is captured by the Nazis,</font>

780
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:08,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the Earth.</font>

781
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:09,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand me?</font>

782
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an obsession, Dad.</font>

783
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:17,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never understood it. Never.</font>

784
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did Mom.</font>

785
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:22,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, she did.</font>

786
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only too well.</font>

787
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:29,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me</font>

788
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:32,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until all I could do was mourn her.</font>

789
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.</font>

790
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freulein Doctor.</font>

791
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is it?
- How did you get here?</font>

792
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it? I want it.</font>

793
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:20,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came back for the book? Why?</font>

794
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father didn't want it incinerated.</font>

795
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:25,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you think of me?</font>

796
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:27,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.</font>

797
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:29,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you stood up to be counted</font>

798
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.</font>

799
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who gives a damn what you think?</font>

800
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:35,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do.</font>

801
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:38,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have to do is squeeze.</font>

802
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have to do is scream.</font>

803
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:53,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.</font>

804
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:07,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you get?
- I don't know.</font>

805
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:09,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First available flight out of Germany.</font>

806
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

807
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we made it.</font>

808
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:43,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,</font>

809
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I'll share that sentiment.</font>

810
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:47,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax.</font>

811
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tickets, please.</font>

812
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:49,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guten Tag, Herr Jones.</font>

813
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:55,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tickets, please.</font>

814
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get out of here.</font>

815
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:12,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No ticket.</font>

816
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:16,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticket.</font>

817
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:17,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticket!
Ticket!</font>

818
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:18,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ticket!
- Ticket!</font>

819
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,</font>

820
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:42,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.</font>

821
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:45,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not all we shared.</font>

822
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:47,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...</font>

823
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:48,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her grandfather.</font>

824
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm as human as the next man.</font>

825
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was the next man.</font>

826
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Well...</font>

827
01:13:57,643 --> 01:13:59,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ships that pass in the night.</font>

828
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?</font>

829
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a milkshake.</font>

830
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did we talk about?</font>

831
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't talk.</font>

832
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:16,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We never talked.</font>

833
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:20,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I detect a rebuke?</font>

834
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:24,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.</font>

835
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:27,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.</font>

836
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,</font>

837
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:30,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.</font>

838
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:34,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I was a wonderful father.</font>

839
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:35,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>

840
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:38,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?</font>

841
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:40,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wash your ears? Do your homework?</font>

842
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:45,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.</font>

843
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:48,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you taught me was
that I was less important to you</font>

844
01:14:48,277 --> 01:14:51,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.</font>

845
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I learned it so well</font>

846
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:55,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.</font>

847
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:58,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left just when
you were becoming interesting</font>

848
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

849
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:01,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad, how can you...
- Very well.</font>

850
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here now.</font>

851
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want to talk about?</font>

852
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:10,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I...</font>

853
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:20,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't think of anything.</font>

854
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you complaining about?</font>

855
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we have work to do.</font>

856
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:32,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we get to Alexandretta,
we will face 3 challenges.</font>

857
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:38,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first, "The Breath of God.
Only the penitent man will pass."</font>

858
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:41,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second, "The Word of God.</font>

859
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."</font>

860
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Third, "The Path Of God.</font>

861
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:52,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth."</font>

862
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:56,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean?</font>

863
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:59,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. We'll find out.</font>

864
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're turning around.</font>

865
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:11,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're taking us back to Germany.</font>

866
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer</font>

867
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to figure out the radio was dead.</font>

868
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:22,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Move!</font>

869
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad. Come on!</font>

870
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you could fly a plane.</font>

871
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:46,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly, yes.</font>

872
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:50,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Land,no.</font>

873
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.</font>

874
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it ready.</font>

875
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:21,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11 o'clock!</font>

876
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:23,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, 11 o'clock!</font>

877
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:27,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens at 11 o'clock?</font>

878
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12, 11, 10.</font>

879
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:32,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11 o'clock, fire!</font>

880
01:17:57,674 --> 01:18:00,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, are we hit?</font>

881
01:18:00,469 --> 01:18:02,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More or less.</font>

882
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, I'm sorry.</font>

883
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:06,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got us.</font>

884
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Dad. We're going in!</font>

885
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:25,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice landing.
- Thanks.</font>

886
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:42,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those people are trying to kill us!</font>

887
01:18:42,427 --> 01:18:44,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, Dad!</font>

888
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:47,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well. It's a new experience for me.</font>

889
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It happens to me all the time.</font>

890
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is intolerable!</font>

891
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could be close.</font>

892
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:35,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster, boy! Faster!</font>

893
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:53,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they don't come
any closer than that!</font>

894
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:12,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, he's coming back!</font>

895
01:20:59,231 --> 01:21:01,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.</font>

896
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:04,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees</font>

897
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and the birds in the sky."</font>

898
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:28,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These pages are taken from
Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,</font>

899
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:29,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they include a map</font>

900
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:32,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.</font>

901
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see,
the Grail is all but in our hands.</font>

902
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:36,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, Your Highness,</font>

903
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,</font>

904
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nor of removing the Grail
from your borders</font>

905
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:45,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without suitable compensation.</font>

906
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:49,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you brought?</font>

907
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious valuables, Your Highness,</font>

908
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:04,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.</font>

909
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:12,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.</font>

910
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:16,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4.3 liter, 30 horsepower,
6-cylinder engine,</font>

911
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:19,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.</font>

912
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:22,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour</font>

913
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in 12.5 seconds.</font>

914
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I even like the color.</font>

915
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.</font>

916
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shall have camels, horses,</font>

917
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an armed escort, provisions,</font>

918
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:40,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">desert vehicles and tanks.</font>

919
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

920
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no time to lose.</font>

921
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:01,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.</font>

922
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:06,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go this way.</font>

923
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that camel out of the way.</font>

924
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to Marcus, Sallah?</font>

925
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:15,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They set out across the desert
this afternoon.</font>

926
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:18,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.</font>

927
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they have the map.</font>

928
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in this sort of race,</font>

929
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:28,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no silver medal
for finishing second.</font>

930
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?</font>

931
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:55,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather spit in your face.</font>

932
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:57,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as I haven't got any spit...</font>

933
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be within three or four miles.</font>

934
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:05,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise we are off the map.</font>

935
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:10,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of</font>

936
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:14,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.</font>

937
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:18,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.</font>

938
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:27,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see Brody.</font>

939
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He seems okay.</font>

940
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've got a tank.</font>

941
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6-pound gun.</font>

942
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:44,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!</font>

943
01:24:44,956 --> 01:24:47,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we're well out of range.</font>

944
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:58,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That car belonged to my brother-in-law.</font>

945
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on!</font>

946
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:02,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see anyone up there.</font>

947
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:03,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it wasn't even Jones.</font>

948
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it is him, all right.</font>

949
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:07,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here somewhere.</font>

950
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:10,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put Brody in the tank.</font>

951
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:20,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, in this sun,</font>

952
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:22,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without transportation,
they're as good as dead.</font>

953
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:33,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Jones, all right.</font>

954
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, who are all these people?
- Who cares?</font>

955
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.</font>

956
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:46,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.</font>

957
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going after those horses.
- I'll take the camels.</font>

958
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't need camels.
- But, Indy...</font>

959
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:17,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No camels.</font>

960
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is he?</font>

961
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:33,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A messenger from God.</font>

962
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:36,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the unrighteous,</font>

963
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:40,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.</font>

964
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus!</font>

965
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:05,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Genius of the Restoration..."</font>

966
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:08,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Aid our own resuscitation."</font>

967
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:09,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, what are you doing here?</font>

968
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.</font>

969
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search him.</font>

970
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is in this book?</font>

971
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:25,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That miserable little diary of yours.</font>

972
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have the map. The book is useless.</font>

973
01:27:28,077 --> 01:27:30,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.</font>

974
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:32,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">VVhy?</font>

975
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you hiding?</font>

976
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?</font>

977
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:43,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself</font>

978
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">should try reading books
instead of burning them.</font>

979
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:48,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel!</font>

980
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones is getting away.</font>

981
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:51,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think not,</font>

982
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:53,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herr Donovan.</font>

983
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:56,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that Jones, the other Jones!</font>

984
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah, I said no camels!</font>

985
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 5 camels. Can't you count?</font>

986
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:12,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.</font>

987
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, your father and Brody...</font>

988
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:15,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my father?</font>

989
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have them.</font>

990
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:19,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the belly of that steel beast.</font>

991
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:43,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

992
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:46,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Dad!</font>

993
01:30:46,943 --> 01:30:49,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Junior?</font>

994
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:50,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior?</font>

995
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:52,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>

996
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

997
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:11,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

998
01:32:11,194 --> 01:32:12,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Get out!</font>

999
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, the pen...</font>

1000
01:33:34,944 --> 01:33:36,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- But don't you see?</font>

1001
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pen is mightier than the sword.</font>

1002
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what you did.</font>

1003
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:05,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's war.</font>

1004
01:34:11,022 --> 01:34:13,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?</font>

1005
01:35:17,588 --> 01:35:19,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Yeah?</font>

1006
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:22,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this archeology?</font>

1007
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:23,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of there, Dad.</font>

1008
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does one get off this thing?</font>

1009
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:44,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Marcus?</font>

1010
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:50,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1011
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:55,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Dad!</font>

1012
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:04,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father of Indy, give me your hand!</font>

1013
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah!</font>

1014
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:07,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Dad!</font>

1015
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:09,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hand!</font>

1016
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>

1017
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:03,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

1018
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

1019
01:37:14,622 --> 01:37:16,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost him.</font>

1020
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I never told him anything.</font>

1021
01:37:25,466 --> 01:37:28,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wasn't ready, Marcus.</font>

1022
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:31,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes would have been enough.</font>

1023
01:38:08,634 --> 01:38:11,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I'd lost you, boy!</font>

1024
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:14,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you had too, sir.</font>

1025
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:29,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1026
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:34,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done. Come on.</font>

1027
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, then.</font>

1028
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:45,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?</font>

1029
01:38:45,212 --> 01:38:47,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go!</font>

1030
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:03,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.</font>

1031
01:41:31,003 --> 01:41:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Helmut, another volunteer!</font>

1032
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:04,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never expected to see you again.</font>

1033
01:42:04,244 --> 01:42:06,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.</font>

1034
01:42:06,747 --> 01:42:10,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.</font>

1035
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:13,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to recover the Grail for us.</font>

1036
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:20,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?</font>

1037
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:23,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As what? A Nazi stooge like you?</font>

1038
01:42:24,014 --> 01:42:25,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nazis?</font>

1039
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:28,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the limit of your vision?</font>

1040
01:42:28,435 --> 01:42:32,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nazis want to write themselves
into the Grail legend,</font>

1041
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:33,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take on the world.</font>

1042
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:36,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they're welcome.</font>

1043
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:39,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I want the Grail itself.</font>

1044
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:42,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cup that gives everlasting life.</font>

1045
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler can have the world,
but he can't take it with him.</font>

1046
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.</font>

1047
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:57,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Grail is mine,</font>

1048
01:42:57,548 --> 01:42:59,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're going to get it for me.</font>

1049
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:01,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shooting me won't get you anywhere.</font>

1050
01:43:02,052 --> 01:43:03,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something, Dr. Jones?</font>

1051
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.</font>

1052
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:09,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1053
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:11,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1054
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:13,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior...</font>

1055
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:15,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Get back!</font>

1056
01:43:33,584 --> 01:43:35,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't save him when you're dead!</font>

1057
01:43:36,003 --> 01:43:37,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The healing power of the Grail</font>

1058
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:39,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the only thing
that can save your father now.</font>

1059
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:42,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.</font>

1060
01:44:18,462 --> 01:44:20,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Breath of God.</font>

1061
01:44:21,673 --> 01:44:24,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only the penitent man will pass."</font>

1062
01:44:25,636 --> 01:44:28,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The penitent man will pass."</font>

The penitent, penitent...</font>

01:45:07,886 --> 01:45:10,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The penitent man is humble before God.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penitent. Penitent...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penitent man is humble,</font>

1073
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:19,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kneels before God.</font>

1074
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:21,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kneel!</font>

1075
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm through!</font>

1076
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:34,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're through.</font>

1077
01:45:36,248 --> 01:45:37,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's all right.</font>

1078
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:39,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1079
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:42,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second challenge:
"The Word of God."</font>

1080
01:45:42,713 --> 01:45:46,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."</font>

1081
01:45:50,137 --> 01:45:52,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Word of God...</font>

1082
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:53,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Word of...</font>

1083
01:45:56,977 --> 01:46:00,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.</font>

1084
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:03,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">-"The Word of God..."
- No, Henry. Try not to talk.</font>

1085
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:12,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name of God...</font>

1086
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:17,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name of God...</font>

1087
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:21,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jehovah.</font>

1088
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:26,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an</font>

01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>

1091
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:42,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiot!</font>

1092
01:46:42,314 --> 01:46:44,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Latin, Jehovah starts with an</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only in the leap from the lion's head</font>

01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:32,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"will he prove his worth."</font>

1102
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:39,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible, nobody can jump this.</font>

1103
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:43,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

1104
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:45,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, you must hurry!</font>

1105
01:47:45,877 --> 01:47:47,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come quickly!</font>

1106
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:56,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a leap of faith.</font>

1107
01:47:56,096 --> 01:47:57,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, geez...</font>

1108
01:47:57,722 --> 01:47:59,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must believe, boy.</font>

1109
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:02,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must believe.</font>

1110
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:51,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd come,</font>

1111
01:49:51,836 --> 01:49:54,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my strength has left me.</font>

1112
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1113
01:49:56,508 --> 01:49:58,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last of three brothers</font>

1114
01:49:58,718 --> 01:50:01,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who swore an oath to find the Grail</font>

1115
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:03,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to guard it.</font>

1116
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:06,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was 700 years ago.</font>

1117
01:50:06,685 --> 01:50:09,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A long time to wait.</font>

1118
01:50:11,147 --> 01:50:14,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're strangely dressed, for a knight.</font>

1119
01:50:15,485 --> 01:50:17,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not exactly...</font>

1120
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:19,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A knight? What do you mean?</font>

1121
01:50:20,365 --> 01:50:22,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was chosen</font>

1122
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:25,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.</font>

1123
01:50:25,787 --> 01:50:29,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honor was mine until another came</font>

1124
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:32,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to challenge me to single combat.</font>

1125
01:50:33,545 --> 01:50:39,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pass it to you who vanquished me.</font>

1126
01:50:42,971 --> 01:50:45,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I don't have time to explain, but...</font>

1127
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one is it?</font>

1128
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:06,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must choose,</font>

1129
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but choose wisely.</font>

1130
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For as the true Grail will bring you life,</font>

1131
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the false Grail</font>

1132
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will take it from you.</font>

1133
01:51:21,593 --> 01:51:23,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a historian.</font>

1134
01:51:23,428 --> 01:51:25,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea what it looks like.</font>

1135
01:51:25,555 --> 01:51:27,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one is it?</font>

1136
01:51:28,016 --> 01:51:29,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me choose.</font>

1137
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:32,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

1138
01:51:45,492 --> 01:51:47,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

1139
01:51:52,999 --> 01:51:56,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.</font>

1140
01:52:07,806 --> 01:52:11,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This certainly is the cup of
the King of Kings.</font>

1141
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:19,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eternal life.</font>

1142
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:56,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is happening to me?</font>

1143
01:53:01,526 --> 01:53:03,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, what is happening?</font>

1144
01:53:26,718 --> 01:53:28,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He chose</font>

1145
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:30,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">poorly.</font>

1146
01:53:40,482 --> 01:53:43,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would not be made out of gold.</font>

1147
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:45,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the cup of a carpenter.</font>

1148
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:57,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way to find out.</font>

1149
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:15,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have chosen wisely.</font>

1150
01:54:16,768 --> 01:54:21,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.</font>

1151
01:54:21,147 --> 01:54:26,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.</font>

1152
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:55,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your guns. Please.</font>

1153
01:55:58,911 --> 01:56:00,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, come on, get to your feet.</font>

1154
01:56:15,303 --> 01:56:17,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have got it. Come on!</font>

1155
01:56:18,723 --> 01:56:21,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa! Elsa, don't move!</font>

1156
01:56:21,643 --> 01:56:23,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.</font>

1157
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:25,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, don't cross the Seal.</font>

1158
01:56:25,938 --> 01:56:28,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.</font>

1159
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:56,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>

1160
01:56:56,636 --> 01:56:58,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior!</font>

1161
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:02,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa...</font>

1162
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, don't. Elsa...</font>

1163
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa...</font>

1164
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:09,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!</font>

1165
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can reach it. I can reach it.</font>

1166
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:14,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!</font>

1167
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:18,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa!</font>

1168
01:57:28,668 --> 01:57:30,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junior, give me your other hand!</font>

1169
01:57:30,378 --> 01:57:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hold on.</font>

1170
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:33,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get it.</font>

1171
01:57:33,673 --> 01:57:35,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can almost reach it, Dad.</font>

1172
01:57:36,509 --> 01:57:38,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>

1173
01:57:39,429 --> 01:57:40,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>

1174
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:46,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it go.</font>

1175
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad...</font>

1176
01:58:13,671 --> 01:58:15,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Dad.</font>

1177
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:49,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa never really believed in the Grail.</font>

1178
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:52,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She thought she'd found a prize.</font>

1179
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:01,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you find, Dad?</font>

1180
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:02,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>

1181
01:59:05,515 --> 01:59:07,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illumination.</font>

1182
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:18,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did you find, Junior?</font>

1183
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:20,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Junior"? Dad...</font>

1184
01:59:20,696 --> 01:59:23,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?</font>

1185
01:59:23,282 --> 01:59:26,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.</font>

1186
01:59:26,244 --> 01:59:28,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like Indiana.</font>

1187
01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:30,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We named the dog Indiana.</font>

1188
01:59:30,248 --> 01:59:32,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May we go home now, please?</font>

1189
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dog?</font>

1190
01:59:34,544 --> 01:59:36,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are named after the dog?</font>

1191
01:59:39,298 --> 01:59:42,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.</font>

1192
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:46,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Ready.</font>

1193
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:50,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!</font>

1194
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got lost in his own museum, huh?</font>

1195
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

1196
01:59:59,735 --> 02:00:02,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you, Junior.</font>

1197
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
