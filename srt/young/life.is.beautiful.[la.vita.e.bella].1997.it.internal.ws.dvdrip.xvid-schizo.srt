1
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,320
This is a simple story...

2
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,966
but not an easy one to tell.

3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,969
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,721
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,530
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,290
"Here I am," said I to chaos.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,846
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good."

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,008
"For what?" said I.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,290
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,050
this man came to possess?

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,969
Here I am, ready.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,765
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,202
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,244
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,600
I heard you.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,802
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,763
Weren't you reciting a poem?

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,801
It doesn't work!

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,524
Brake!

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,849
We're going to die!
The woods!

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,008
Brake!

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,250
The king is coming!

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,647
There he is!

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,328
It's full of people down there.
Straight.

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,965
We have no brakes!

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,651
We have no brakes! Move!

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,240
Go for a walk.

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,488
Otherwise,
we'll get there tomorrow.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,568
I found the screw.

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,290
Now what do you need?

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,244
Nothing.
I need ten minutes alone.

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,011
All right,
I'll leave you alone.

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,282
Do you want the screw
from before?

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,528
No, I want to be alone.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,483
Do I toss out the screw
if I find it?

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,490
I need ten minutes alone.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,763
I'm washing my hands.

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,243
Pretty girl! How's it going?

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,930
What are you doing?

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,441
Did your mom put this stuff here?

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,289
No, the landlady did.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,051
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,162
How much is it?
How old are you?

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,602
- What's your name?
- Eleonora.

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,848
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,806
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,729
All this is mine.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,002
Here starts the prince's principate.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,361
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,963
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,128
Camels?

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,368
Even a few hippopotamus.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,528
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,120
- When?
- Now!

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,642
Good morning, Princess!

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,048
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,730
I've never been better.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,410
Do you always leave
the house like this?

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,251
I wanted to burn that wasps nest,
but I got stung.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,681
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,086
Hold still, Princess.

62
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,568
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

63
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,284
You have to get it out.

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,643
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,806
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,366
What a place here!
It's beautiful!

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,324
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moving here!

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,206
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,129
Exactly.

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,289
Prince Guido
at your service, Princess.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,129
I'm coming!

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,208
Goodbye, then.

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,642
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,762
If you really want
to thank me...

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,123
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelet for my squire.

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,242
Take whatever you want.
It's all yours.

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,566
Thank you!

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,571
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelet.

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,684
Goodbye, Eleonora!
My regards, Princess.

80
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,642
Farewell.

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,731
Here I am, Nuvolari!
Tonight's special: omelet!

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,763
All camels here!

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,840
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

84
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,928
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,123
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maitre.

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,130
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,446
There. We're here.

88
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,728
That's Robin Hood,
my uncle's horse.

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,842
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,803
And inside is my uncle.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,486
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,409
Here we are.
The car broke down!

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,888
Uncle!

94
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,928
- Barbarians.
- Who were they?

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,202
- Barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

96
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,891
Silence is
the most powerful cry.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,809
Is he your poet friend?

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,207
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,928
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,408
An old passion...
an odd and end in itself!

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,761
What's all this stuff for?

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,965
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

103
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,163
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.

104
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,203
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,606
Barbarians.

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,202
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,767
The bathroom, equipped
with the invention of Mr. Bidet.

108
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,601
There are a few books here,
among which The Life of Petrarch.

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,521
The kitchen is in there. This is
a velocipede, commonly called a bike.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,690
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

111
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,565
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,450
What an uncle!

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,043
Look at this!

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,446
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,245
If you want to do something,
you do it.

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,761
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

117
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,209
Stop it!
What are you, crazy?

118
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,164
You can't act
like you do in the country.

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,727
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!

120
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,569
Mary! The key!

121
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,369
See? You can't yell.

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,087
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,921
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

124
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,042
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

125
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,288
You have to settle down!

126
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,006
What a nice hat.
How does it look?

127
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,646
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,762
When do I start working?

129
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,087
You're already late.
Right away!

130
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,771
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,930
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,805
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.

133
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,651
Goodbye,
and behave yourselves...

134
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,161
because these are hard times.

135
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,884
Hard, hard times!

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,843
They're hard times?

137
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,884
Why, what are your
political views?

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,083
Benito! Adolph!
Be good!

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,009
What did you say?

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,204
I said, how are things going?

141
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,209
Goodbye, then.

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,890
Careful!
You'll break the legs!

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,646
Goodbye!

144
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,724
He pulled it off.
He took my hat. I'll find him though.

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,047
Benito,
you're going to get a slap!

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,766
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.

147
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,167
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

148
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,089
Then we'd better
open a file now.

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,647
First you apply, and
the department head has to sign it.

150
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,007
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

151
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,044
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.

152
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,889
I, the undersigned,
Guido Orefice...

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,731
- am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!

154
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,888
What's going on?

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,401
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

156
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,444
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

157
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,927
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,441
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.

159
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,087
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,168
It's ten to one.

161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,645
File a complaint.

162
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,770
Boy, is he nasty.

163
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,327
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,410
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,887
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned..."

166
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,009
What a wallop!

167
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,891
Are you hurt?
I'll help you.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,604
Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,245
Don't touch me!

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,410
You can forget
about your bookshop!

171
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,601
No, the eggs!

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,641
You scoundrel!
I'll kill you!

173
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,130
Out of the way!

174
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,127
Good morning, Princess.

175
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,284
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.

176
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,006
Excuse me,
but I've got to run.

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,600
Farewell, Princess!

178
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,961
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

179
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,765
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate.

180
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,644
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."

181
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,207
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.

182
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,971
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.

183
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,651
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

184
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,081
Piece of cake, Uncle.

185
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,124
I stick the wing under the leg.

186
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,607
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...

187
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,802
Lobster is a crustacean.

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,128
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.

189
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,201
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

190
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,051
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

191
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,605
There's nothing left.

192
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,451
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

193
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,805
- I don't remember how to do lobster.
- You serve it as is.

194
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,888
There's no need to touch it!

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,207
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

196
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,004
- Continue.
- Behavior!

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,122
Stand by.
Still, like this.

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,969
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"

199
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,526
In position.
Stand by behavior. Waiter!

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,960
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?

201
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,128
Bowing!
Piece of cake.

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,885
You bow down, further.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

204
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,810
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

205
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,730
90 degrees.
A right angle. 180.

206
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,083
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,044
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

208
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,606
But if you see some
that are too bowed down...

209
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,245
it means they're dead!

210
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,647
You're serving.
You're not a servant.

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,842
Serving is a supreme art.

212
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,327
God is the first servant.

213
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,489
God serves men,
but he's not a servant to men.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,525
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

215
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,810
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

216
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,803
You'll take it back
in a month or so.

217
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,685
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,410
Why?

219
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,049
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

220
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,401
Of course I was.

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,251
You fell asleep
while talking to me!

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,601
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

223
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,404
Who?

224
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,967
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

225
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,889
"I am what I want to be."

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,004
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

227
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,282
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.

228
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,529
Amazing.
And it's simple too.

229
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,723
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

230
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,726
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

231
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,083
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

232
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,043
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

233
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,849
Amazing, though.

234
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,164
Wake up.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,760
Wake up.

236
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,609
What is it now?
What are you doing?

237
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,848
- It totally works!
- What works?

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,806
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."

239
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,083
Bam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

240
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,567
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

241
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,365
That's why I woke up.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,689
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

243
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,242
It's deep.
You have to think it.

244
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,529
Why are you running?
Slow down!

245
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,011
Hurry up. It's late!

246
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,043
Mary, the key!

247
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,049
Every morning,
she throws the key.

248
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,446
Look!

249
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,245
There's that teacher.
Boy, is she pretty.

250
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,523
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

251
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,564
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

252
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,966
Don't move!

253
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,051
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

254
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,322
He'll kill me if he sees me.
Be good.

255
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,522
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

256
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,608
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

257
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,088
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.

258
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,522
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!

259
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,371
Don't move.
He'll kill me if he sees me!

260
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,845
Stay still, Ferruccio.

261
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,801
Good morning, Princess!

262
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,529
It's you again.
How do you do this?

263
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,087
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,329
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?

265
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,410
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

266
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,683
We could make plans to meet.

267
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,201
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

268
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,845
Let's go, Dora.
You'll be late.

269
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,561
I hope we meet again
suddenly.

270
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,729
Farewell, Princess!

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,888
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,207
She likes it
when I suddenly appear.

273
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,361
I don't believe it.

274
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,767
"Obscurity."

275
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,450
You're a genius!

276
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,404
"The bigger it is,
the less you see it."

277
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,124
Solution: obscurity.

278
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,811
Marvelous.
Did you make that riddle up?

279
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,369
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.

280
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,050
Obscurity!

281
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,811
Salmon, salad
and a glass of white wine.

282
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,002
Listen to this one, Guido.

283
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,964
If I may, it's my turn.

284
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,048
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,640
"The dwarves and Snow White
sit down for a bite.

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,049
How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

287
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,482
It sounds refined.

288
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,602
I want to solve it right now.

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,929
- Eat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

290
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,088
Salad, salmon, white wine.
It's light.

291
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,009
The dwarves...

292
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,970
and Snow White.

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,204
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?

294
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,290
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the Ministry. He wants to eat.

295
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,925
The kitchen is closed.

296
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,407
Oh, well, he would have
given you a good tip.

297
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,329
The kitchen is open.

298
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,570
Come right in.

299
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,527
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

300
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,690
"The dwarves and Snow White..."

301
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,082
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

302
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,683
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

303
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,565
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

304
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,889
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded liver.

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,321
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

306
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,649
We have...
a nice fatty turbot...

307
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,843
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...

308
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,610
or some lean salmon...

309
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,961
The salmon, thank you.

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,526
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

311
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,525
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...

312
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,122
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter
with a flaky sauce...

313
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,848
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

314
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,568
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

315
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,160
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

316
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,647
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.

317
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,922
Perfect.
As soon as possible.

318
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,849
I'll do my best.

319
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,006
"How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

320
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,326
Right.

321
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,286
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

322
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,448
Good night, genius.

323
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,046
What did he say? The dwarves?
What is he, drunk?

324
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,810
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."

325
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,404
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."

326
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,648
If there are seven dwarves dining...

327
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,001
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds."

328
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,683
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

329
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,883
But he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.

330
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,247
Excuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.

331
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,049
The elementary school? A friend
of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.

332
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,367
It's not far from here. Why?

333
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,801
Good. I can sleep
an extra half hour.

334
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,208
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?

335
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,970
They're expecting me at 8:30.

336
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,325
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

337
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,364
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.

338
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,482
I want to make
a good impression on him.

339
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,082
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.

340
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,283
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country.

341
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,927
The inspector is here, ma'am.

342
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,566
He's already here?
He's early!

343
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,205
Sit down, Roberto!

344
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,961
All rise!

345
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,843
Good morning, Princess.

346
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,207
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.

347
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,448
These are some of our teachers.

348
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,291
Good.

349
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,811
Therefore...

350
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,128
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

351
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,571
Sixteen.

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,485
Are you up to date
with the ongoing...

353
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,648
school program approved
by the Ministry this year?

354
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,091
Yes.

355
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,970
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

356
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,889
Of course.

357
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,281
What are you doing on Sunday?

358
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,962
No, I mean, Sunday is St. Mary's Day.
What are you doing?

359
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,321
I'm going to the theater.

360
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,521
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

361
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,608
Right,
they're playing Offenbach.

362
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,849
Fine. Well...

363
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,605
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...

364
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,131
We know.

365
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,402
As you know, the inspector...

366
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,171
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

367
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,523
signed by the most well versed
Italian scientists.

368
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,689
He will, and we're very honored...

369
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,121
demonstrate to us that our race...

370
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,049
is a superior race...

371
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,242
the best of all.

372
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,089
Take your seats.

373
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,360
Go ahead, Inspector.

374
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,051
- Our race...
- Is superior.

375
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,491
Naturally!

376
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,688
Our race is superior.

377
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,202
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

378
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,483
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

379
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,409
that our race
is a superior one.

380
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,284
I was...

381
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,405
chosen, I was,
by racist Italian scientists...

382
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,329
in order to demonstrate...

383
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,966
how superior our race is.

384
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,641
Why did they pick me, children?

385
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,647
Must I tell you?

386
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,089
Where can you find...

387
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,204
someone more handsome than me?

388
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,041
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race"...

389
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,491
pure Aryan.

390
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,284
Children.

391
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,244
Let's start with something that
one says: "What's so big about that?"

392
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,649
The ear. Look at
the perfection of this ear.

393
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,161
Left auricle...

394
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,726
with a pendant
little bell at the end.

395
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,605
Check it out.
Movable cartilage.

396
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,245
Bendable.

397
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,091
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

398
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,886
But you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,844
Races exists, children.
You bet they do!

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,964
But let's continue.
I want to show you something else.

401
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,684
Pay attention.

402
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,922
He said Inspector?

403
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,883
From Rome?

404
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,089
The belly button!

405
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,369
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!

406
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,642
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

407
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,525
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

408
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,484
This is an Italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

409
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,523
Check out this style!

410
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,248
Look at these muscles:
ceps, biceps, triceps!

411
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,170
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

412
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,205
Just look at the movement!

413
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,446
Gentlemen!

414
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,689
I must say goodbye now.

415
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,690
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

416
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,371
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

417
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,209
Farewell!
The belly button!

418
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,365
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

419
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,723
I can only hear
out of this ear.

420
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,604
Look at me, Princess.

421
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,529
Go on, I'm down here.

422
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,006
Look at me, Princess.

423
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,931
Turn around, Princess.

424
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,567
Turn around, around...

425
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,489
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

426
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,726
Why?

427
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,845
We have to be at the Prefect's at eight.
We were invited to dinner.

428
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,644
- Where?
- At the Prefect's.

429
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,446
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

430
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,530
- Another dinner at the Prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

431
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,971
Bingo!

432
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,529
Let's us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the Prefect's for coffee.

433
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,608
I'm not coming!

434
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,166
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

435
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,408
It'll just be me and you.

436
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,683
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.

437
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,360
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

438
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,289
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

439
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,727
Where is she?
Did you see her?

440
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,081
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

441
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,126
On time tomorrow, got it?

442
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,527
Did you take that stuff
out of the car?

443
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,120
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Be very careful.

444
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,247
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!

445
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,365
Is that one of your curtains?

446
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,404
No, it must be
one of my colleague's.

447
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,803
He took my hat again!

448
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,962
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

449
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,651
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

450
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,001
All right, you wait here.

451
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,329
I'll pull up right here
and toot.

452
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,528
Give me the key!

453
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,688
Not the house key!
The car key!

454
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,288
The car key?
Are you crazy?

455
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,926
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.

456
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,407
Keep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

457
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,602
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!

458
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,407
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.

459
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,285
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

460
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,246
Plus, dinner at the Prefect's
gets me so nervous!

461
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,007
I knew it.
I've got the hiccups.

462
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,091
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.

463
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,124
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

464
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,846
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Even two!

465
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,282
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens, happens.

466
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,528
Instead you...

467
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,409
Good morning, Princess!

468
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,925
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

469
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,771
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!

470
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,690
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.

471
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,565
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.

472
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,366
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

473
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,642
You even turn up in my dreams.

474
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,368
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

475
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,289
I don't blame you, but...

476
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,722
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.

477
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,810
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

478
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,924
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theater. Take me back.

479
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,246
What's happening?

480
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,967
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?

481
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,923
Step on the brakes!

482
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,246
Have no fear!
Hang on to me!

483
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,169
It's broken!

484
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,203
When did you learn to drive?

485
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,607
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

486
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,610
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

487
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,371
Wait! We're stuck!

488
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,960
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

489
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,128
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.

490
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,242
Cover yourself with this.

491
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,328
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.

492
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,607
I'll take care of everything.

493
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,089
Here we go.

494
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,327
Step right out, Princess.

495
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,202
There!
Step right out!

496
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,282
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

497
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,571
Here!

498
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,969
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

499
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,845
We've already been here.

500
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,442
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

501
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,244
The night it was raining...

502
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,681
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!

503
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,646
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...

504
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,242
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...

505
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,521
you kissed me.

506
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,568
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

507
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,081
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

508
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,010
He had the ability
to make me do anything.

509
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,407
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

510
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,522
I was like putty in his hand.

511
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,211
I always, always, always said yes.

512
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,205
So, all these treasures
you're hiding...

513
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,882
there is a way to open this treasure
chest and always get you to say yes!

514
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,128
It's easier than you think.

515
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,561
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

516
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,001
Heaven knows.

517
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,804
It's clearing up.

518
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,321
So, you were saying...

519
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,808
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.

520
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,001
Yes.

521
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,248
I'll give it a try.

522
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,763
If the Virgin Mary tosses
it down to me... You never know.

523
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,803
Mary, the key!

524
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,324
Is this it?

525
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,330
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

526
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,283
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

527
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,687
- Then when?
- I don't know.

528
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,644
Are we going to let heaven
decide that too?

529
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,526
No, leave Mary alone.
Don't bother her over an ice cream!

530
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,167
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

531
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,760
I have to ask her.

532
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,882
Mary, send someone to find out...

533
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,651
how long before
we can have the ice cream!

534
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,929
Seven seconds!

535
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,844
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

536
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,883
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,287
I wanted to open
my store right out front.

538
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,051
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

539
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,685
Goodbye then.

540
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,088
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

541
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,407
I forgot to tell you.

542
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,130
Go ahead.

543
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,971
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making love to you.

544
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,244
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

545
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,283
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.

546
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,325
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.

547
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,568
Not just once.
Over and over again!

548
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,284
But I'll never tell you that.

549
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,847
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

550
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,769
right here,
for the rest of my life.

551
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,687
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

552
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,564
Princess.

553
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,370
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

554
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,131
It's that hat that bothers me.

555
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,528
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

556
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,042
How did it go?
Right, it's easy!

557
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,960
Mary, send someone
to give my friend a dry hat.

558
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,128
Good night, Princess.
Farewell.

559
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,483
- Excuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

560
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,971
If you don't get up
immediately...

561
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,846
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.

562
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,530
For the rest of my life!

563
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,729
I'm going to count
to three now.

564
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,127
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

565
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,688
Good girl.

566
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,087
Do you know
who's getting married?

567
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,010
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

568
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,488
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

569
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,648
But she hasn't even
shown up yet.

570
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,842
Everybody's waiting.

571
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,008
I've looked everywhere for you!

572
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,168
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

573
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,169
Something's happened.
Come with me!

574
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,089
Outside! The horse!

575
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,681
What's that?

576
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,802
Is that your horse?

577
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,446
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

578
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,450
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

579
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,645
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

580
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,046
"Jewish horse"!

581
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,210
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...

582
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,164
They didn't do it "to."
They did it "to."

583
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,442
You'll have to get
used to it, Guido.

584
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,166
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

585
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,487
What could possibly happen to me?

586
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,171
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

587
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,282
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

588
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,449
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.

589
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,881
Let's go. I'll clean him up
in the morning.

590
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,809
Take him back to the stall.

591
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,801
Look, there, in front of you!

592
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,209
Wait. I'll surprise her.

593
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,923
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.

594
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,849
Doctor Lessing!
Where are you going?

595
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,885
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Berlin immediately.

596
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,725
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

597
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,410
I'll take just one.

598
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,688
I'll take it to my wife:
Guido's flower.

599
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,811
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

600
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,729
You're the most ingenious...

601
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,366
waiter I've ever come across.

602
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,529
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever served.

603
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,210
Thank you.

604
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,129
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

605
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,049
By the way.

606
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,764
"If you say my name...

607
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,281
I'm not there anymore.
Who am I?"

608
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,044
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.

609
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,249
What is it?
What did he say?

610
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,730
"Silence!"

611
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,050
Beautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there anymore. Silence.

612
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,847
I'm not talking about Berlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

613
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,730
Third grade.
Listen to this problem.

614
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,605
I remember it
because it shocked me.

615
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,724
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.

616
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,002
A cripple,
four and a half marks.

617
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,771
An epileptic,
three marks and a half.

618
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,202
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

619
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,608
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

620
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,371
if these individuals
were eliminated?

621
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,767
I can't believe this!

622
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,406
That was my exact reaction.

623
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,490
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...

624
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,443
has to solve
this kind of equation.

625
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,531
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

626
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,802
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.

627
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,729
That's high school material for us.

628
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,765
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

629
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,649
300,000 times four.

630
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,889
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.

631
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
- It's easy!
- Exactly!

632
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,844
But you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!

633
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,769
It's truly another race.

634
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,361
"Good morning, Princess."

635
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,090
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

636
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,725
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!

637
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,683
Let's dance.

638
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,924
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

639
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,042
and you've known
for several years.

640
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,164
Dora and I were born
on the same street.

641
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,965
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

642
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,130
Dora is the woman of my life...

643
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,483
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...

644
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,126
we've decided to get married
within the year.

645
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,971
You're all officially invited
on April the 9th...

646
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,606
to the Basilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

647
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,850
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...

648
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,088
just as happy as we are now.

649
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,761
Kiss her! Kiss her!

650
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,528
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

651
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,529
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

652
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,961
Who put this armchair here?

653
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,486
Are you all right?

654
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,568
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

655
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,682
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...

656
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,928
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

657
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,008
Go back to your table.

658
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,929
Go on. I can do this.

659
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,449
Are you all right?

660
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,282
Fine! Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?

661
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,131
No, nothing is wrong.

662
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,130
But...
Go to the kitchen.

663
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,681
The kitchen.

664
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,007
They moved everything
around tonight.

665
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,168
Look where they put the kitchen.

666
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,851
Peek-a-boo!
Guess who?

667
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,161
It's me!
What, have you gone soft?

668
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,561
Miss.

669
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,331
We finally meet, Dora.

670
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,684
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

671
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,361
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel anymore!

672
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,643
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

673
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,603
You sly old dog!

674
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,331
What a jolly fellow!

675
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,644
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

676
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,649
I apologize.

677
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,764
Princess!

678
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,689
You're here too?

679
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,969
Take me away.

680
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,927
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

681
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,681
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,201
The Ethiopian cake!

683
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,685
Thank you!
Music, maestro!

684
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,327
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

685
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,410
Right this way, Princess.

686
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,085
But you're...

687
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,890
Quickly, Princess.

688
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,291
But he's...

689
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,609
He's that jerk with the eggs!

690
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,290
Ferruccio!

691
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,483
He's got the keys to the house,
darn it all!

692
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,290
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.

693
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,563
I'm a whiz with wire.
My pop taught me.

694
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,889
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.

695
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,849
I opened it.

696
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,091
Joshua!

697
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,727
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

698
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,288
I lost my tank.

699
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,641
Don't worry.
We'll find it.

700
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,206
Where did you leave the tank?

701
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,527
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

702
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,120
Hold the bicycle.
I'll get it.

703
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,451
Here.

704
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,760
Let's go.

705
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,730
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

706
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,446
You're late for school! Go!

707
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,006
There's a horse!
Two horses!

708
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,882
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!

709
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,402
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!

710
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,329
Stop it! Let me off!

711
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,685
Here we are.

712
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,325
See you tonight.

713
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,929
Go fast, Pop!

714
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,609
Can we buy this for Mommy?

715
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,610
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

716
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,963
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

717
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,650
Let's go, Joshua.

718
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,001
"No Jews or dogs...

719
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,851
allowed."

720
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,650
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?

721
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,081
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

722
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,328
Everybody does what they want to.

723
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,408
There's a hardware store there.

724
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,330
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

725
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,249
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

726
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,603
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.

727
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,724
I said, "May we?" "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

728
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,842
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

729
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,486
We let everybody
into our bookshop.

730
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,409
No. From now on,
we'll write it too.

731
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,887
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

732
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,367
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

733
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,245
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

734
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,170
I'm sick and tired
of these Visigoths.

735
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,771
Good morning.

736
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,928
Everything's half price.

737
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,089
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

738
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,602
- You have to come to the Prefect's.
- Again?

739
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,643
- He already went.
- Let's go.

740
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,727
Why?

741
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,246
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

742
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,646
All right.

743
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,410
- I'm coming too.
- No.

744
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,807
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?

1
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,807
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?

2
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,729
Not long at all.

3
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,166
Joshua, make sure
you treat the customers good!

4
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,886
I'll be right back.

5
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,649
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.

6
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,242
No, it says ten lire.

7
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,011
Everything's half price.

8
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,290
Give this to your mom
and tell her it's from Grandma.

9
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,802
I've never seen
my grandma before.

10
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,446
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

11
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,364
You'll meet her tomorrow.

12
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,448
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

13
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,722
Because tomorrow
is your birthday...

14
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,968
and your grandma will come
and bring you a nice present.

15
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,050
A new tank?

16
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,211
No, a surprise.

17
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,129
Give the letter to your mom.

18
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,204
Bye, Joshua.

19
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,004
You forgot your change,
Grandma.

20
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,527
Thank you.

21
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,807
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.

22
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,571
I'm going to stop by my uncle's to see
if he'll bring some leftovers.

23
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,690
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.

24
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,440
It's about time!

25
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,324
JEWISH STORE

26
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,205
- It's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.

27
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,051
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.

28
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,685
He's right.

29
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,609
You change your shirt.

30
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,007
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

31
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,441
They're outside.
I already picked them.

32
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,360
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

33
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,881
I don't want to take one!

34
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,809
Hurry up.
I have to go pick Grandma up.

35
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,203
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.

36
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,083
I took one on Friday!

37
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,923
Do you know where Joshua is?

38
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,008
He must be in there.

39
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,929
Will you put those things
in order?

40
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,122
Why don't you show me the flowers?
They look so beautiful.

41
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,811
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?

42
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,925
I'll make them come right over.
Come, flowers!

43
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,644
Come, nightstand!

44
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,570
Schopenhauer, willpower,
I want the nightstand to come here.

45
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,126
Nightstand, come.

46
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,841
Stop, nightstand!

47
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,043
The nightstand seems
very dirty to me.

48
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,243
Good morning, Princess!

49
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,488
He can already read and write?

50
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,080
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.

51
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,168
We're here.

52
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,203
I'll help you get out.

53
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,129
No, I can do it myself.

54
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,122
Dora, what's wrong?

55
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,449
Are we there?

56
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,847
No, it's a crossing.

57
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,081
Will you tell me
where we're going now?

58
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,521
What do you mean, where?

59
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,450
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going...

60
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,006
to the place...
What's it called?

61
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,764
We're going...

62
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,008
Where are we going?

63
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,841
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

64
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,361
You've always said
you wanted to go on a trip!

65
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,450
It took me months
to plan this whole thing.

66
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,842
You know where we're going?

67
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,566
I can't tell you.
I promised Mom I wouldn't tell.

68
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,409
You know how she is.
She'll get mad.

69
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,522
It makes me laugh.

70
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,883
My pop planned something like this
for me when I was little too.

71
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,528
It was so...
Boy, it was funny!

72
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,722
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.

73
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,128
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really...

74
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,685
It really makes me laugh.

75
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,081
I'm tired.

76
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,043
Go to sleep.

77
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,530
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?

78
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,121
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.

79
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,890
What organization!

80
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,526
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

81
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,051
It's really nice!

82
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,243
It's all wooden inside. Everybody
stands up. There's not one seat.

83
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,523
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

84
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,722
It's obvious
you've never been on one!

85
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,923
No, everybody
stands real close together.

86
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,045
Do you see this line?
I got the last tickets just in time!

87
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,369
Hurry up, Uncle Eliseo.
I don't want them to say, "Too late.

88
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,005
It's full.
Go back home."

89
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,488
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

90
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,409
Look at this line!

91
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,771
Here we are!
We made a reservation!

92
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,368
Thank you!

93
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,402
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.

94
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,921
What mistake?

95
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,646
My husband and son
are on that train.

96
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,524
What's your husband's name?

97
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,722
Guido Orefice.

98
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,284
Joshua Orefice...

99
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,246
and Eliseo Orefice
are on that train too.

100
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,169
There's no mistake.

101
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,849
I want to get
on that train too.

102
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,321
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.

103
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,726
Go, leave!

104
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,049
Go back home, ma'am.

105
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,685
I want to get on that train.

106
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,846
Let me get on that train!

107
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,447
Mom's here!

108
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,848
They stopped the train
to let Mom get on.

109
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,650
Uncle Eliseo.

110
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,443
Are you happy? Did you see this place?
Are you tired?

111
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,803
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.

112
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,002
We'll take the bus back.

113
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,205
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!

114
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,005
- I told them.
- It's better.

115
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,204
You see?
It's all organized!

116
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,564
Did you see that line?
People are lined up to get inside!

117
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,048
- Everybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?

118
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,810
That's it!

119
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,287
It's that game where...

120
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,641
It's the game...

121
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,569
We're all players.

122
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,446
It's all organized.
The game is...

123
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,564
the men are over here,
the women are over there.

124
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,684
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.

125
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,167
It's hard, you know.
It's not easy.

126
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,841
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home.

127
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,849
That means you have to be
very careful.

128
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,282
But if you win,
you get first prize!

129
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,562
What's the prize?

130
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,569
First prize!

131
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,924
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.

132
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,567
This one's a real tank!
Brand new!

133
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,728
Real?

134
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,446
Yes!
I didn't want to tell you.

135
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,523
Where's Uncle Eliseo going?

136
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,086
He's on another team.
It's all organized.

137
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,202
Bye, Uncle!

138
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,287
A real tank.

139
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,289
What did I tell you?

140
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,765
Fabulous!

141
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,803
What a place!

142
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,925
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!

143
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,167
Coming through!

144
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,487
There's our place!

145
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,448
This is our bed.
We'll sleep real close.

146
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,927
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.

147
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,963
We will be!

148
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,686
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!

149
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,929
Plus they're really mean here!
They yell!

150
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,886
They yell because everybody wants
first prize. They have to be tough.

151
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,642
- Can I see Mommy?
- When the game's over.

152
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,000
When's it over?

153
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,287
You have to get
a thousand points.

154
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,160
Whoever gets a thousand points
wins a tank.

155
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,965
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?

156
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,447
A snack?

157
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,245
Just ask.
We're all friends here.

158
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,045
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Bartolomeo.

159
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,208
Let me ask you something.

160
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,324
Did the guy who hands out
the bread and jam already come by?

161
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,082
Darn it all!
We missed him by a second!

162
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,522
He'll come back again though,
won't he?

163
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,211
He's coming back.

164
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,130
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.

165
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,322
He's going to explain
the camp's rules.

166
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,768
- Do you speak German?
- No.

167
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,123
The game starts now. Whoever's here
is here, whoever's not is not.

168
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,161
The first one to get a thousand points
wins. The prize is a tank!

169
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,241
Lucky him!

170
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,400
Every day we'll announce who's in
the lead from that loudspeaker.

171
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,251
The one with the least points
has to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

172
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,600
right here on his back.

173
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,131
We play the part
of the real mean guys who yell.

174
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,605
Whoever's scared loses points.

175
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,682
You'll lose your points
for three things.

176
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,644
One, if you cry.

177
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,525
Two, if you want
to see your mommy.

178
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,928
Three, if you're hungry
and you want a snack.

179
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,485
Forget about it!

180
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,286
It's easy to lose points
for being hungry.

181
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,482
Just yesterday
I lost 40 points...

182
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,251
because I absolutely had
to have a jam sandwich.

183
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,042
Apricot jam!
He wanted strawberry.

184
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,966
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.

185
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,605
We eat them all!

186
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,091
I ate 20 of them yesterday!

187
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,687
What a stomachache.
But they sure were good.

188
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,761
You bet.

189
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,805
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide and seek.

190
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,729
I have to go now
or they'll find me.

191
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,200
Don't ask me anything.
Ask Bartolomeo. He knows everything.

192
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,561
Don't forget to tell me
what he said too.

193
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,523
A thousand points?

194
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,881
I told you we're going
to have fun!

195
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,162
These guys are crazy!

196
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,001
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

197
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,487
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

198
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,331
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

199
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,602
We're here until tonight!

200
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,929
Bartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

201
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,611
To the hospital.
I hurt my arm.

202
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,088
We're going to die here!

203
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,044
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.

204
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,527
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?

205
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,086
They'll kill you!

206
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,408
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.

207
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,091
Good Lord!
I'll never make it!

208
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,088
It's got to be
10,000 degrees in here!

209
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,560
Pop!

210
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,330
Look here! See?
It's nice, huh?

211
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,768
We're signed up.

212
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,043
When I got there to sign up...

213
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,811
the referee was there
and he said...

214
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,526
"No, you and your son
aren't on the list.

215
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,881
You didn't pay your dues."

216
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,923
I almost fell over.

217
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,044
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!

218
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,766
Joshua and I signed up.

219
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,602
Give me my number!"
In fact, they gave me one. Look.

220
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,247
I had them put it here, too,
just in case.

221
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,328
See what a nice place...

222
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,368
your pop takes you to?

223
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,046
Did you play with
the other kids?

224
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,686
Yes, but they don't
know the rules.

225
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,291
They said it isn't true that
first prize is a tank.

226
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,482
They don't know anything
about the points.

227
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,968
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.

228
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,003
They want to beat you!
Are you joking?

229
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,567
There's no tank?
Don't you believe them!

230
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,445
How many points
did we get today?

231
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,324
Fifty.

232
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,205
Forty-eight. They took two points
away from me because...

233
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,402
I tripped while I was...

234
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,648
playing hopscotch.

235
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,404
We...

236
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,127
laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!

237
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,049
Boy, did I have fun!

238
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,447
I can't wait to start
all over again tomorrow!

239
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,121
Hopscotch, tug of war
and ring around the rosy.

240
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,402
Every game.
I don't even remember all of them.

241
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,047
"You guys are obsessed! Stop!
I'm tired!" I said.

242
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,969
Listen.

243
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,482
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.

244
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,446
Good boy!
That means you got 12 points too!

245
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,767
Forty-eight for me, 12 for you.

246
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,086
Sixty points.

247
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,249
This is what you get
when you get up to 60.

248
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,569
A plain piece of bread,
no jam.

249
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,682
Here, eat this.

250
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,647
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

251
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,205
It sure is!

252
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,241
Look who's here!
Bartolomeo!

253
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,361
How'd it go?

254
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,490
Any worse than this...
I got 20 of them.

255
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,686
We got more than him.

256
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,041
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!

257
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,926
I already told you:
no children or old ladies!

258
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,884
Back inside!
You don't work!

259
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,446
The rest, downstairs!

260
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,370
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

261
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,286
That one's new.
She learned right away.

262
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,722
The lady at the door,
she seemed nice when she first came.

263
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,569
She's the worst of all!

264
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,331
At least she didn't send
the old ladies and children to work.

265
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,842
They don't send old people and kids
to work because they kill them!

266
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,566
One of these days
they'll call them to take a shower.

267
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,409
"Children, shower time!"

268
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,888
The truth is, they make them
shower there in the gas chamber.

269
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,604
Downstairs!

270
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,965
How can I do this?

271
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,570
Vittorino!

272
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,321
Where'd they find
all these anvils?

273
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,204
Pop!

274
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,247
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!

275
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,010
Go away!

276
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,361
Why aren't you with
the other kids?

277
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,164
They said...

278
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,250
all us kids have to take
a shower today, and I don't want to.

279
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,729
- Go take a shower!
- No!

280
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,649
I'm not going to.

281
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,205
Go take a shower!

282
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,770
What are you doing here?

283
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,488
We're making... a tank.

284
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,683
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.

285
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,564
We're running slow.

286
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,130
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

287
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,130
I don't want to!

288
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,801
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!
Ten points off for you!

289
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,003
Hide behind there.
We'll go back together when I'm done.

290
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,929
Don't let anyone see you!

291
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,849
This sure is fun.

292
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,765
Everything!

293
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,326
Take everything off!
Hang it up there!

294
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,489
You'll get it back
after the shower.

295
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,806
Forward!

296
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,087
Remember your number
to get your clothes back!

297
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,524
Women and children
will shower together.

298
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,563
Are you hurt?

299
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,883
Thanks, Bartolomeo.

300
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,765
From now on, you have to
hide here the whole day.

301
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,326
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.

302
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,124
What do I have to do?

303
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,481
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.

304
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,523
You have to hide here all day.

305
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,804
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell.

306
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,160
Remember.

307
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,044
Stay hidden!

308
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,686
This is the hardest part.

309
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,169
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.

310
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,011
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.

311
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,885
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

312
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,286
Got it?

313
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,521
Got ya!

314
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,611
Good boy!

315
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,886
Anybody here?
Am I disturbing?

316
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,722
Come here!

317
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,729
Quick as lightning!

318
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,130
Good morning, Princess!

319
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,131
Last night,
I dreamt about you all night!

320
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,404
We were going to the movies.
You were wearing that pink suit...

321
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,090
that I really like.

322
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,441
You're all I think about,
Princess.

323
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,040
I always think about you.
And now...

324
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,605
Mommy!

325
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,566
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow,
but he doesn't know how to drive!

326
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,045
We laugh like crazy!

327
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,801
We're in the lead!
How many points do we have today?

328
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,049
Run! The mean guys
who yell are behind us!

329
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,527
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!

330
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,529
Are they dry?

331
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,730
They're dry.

332
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,490
Catch.

333
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,125
Get dressed.

334
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,202
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

335
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,527
They didn't make it.

336
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,122
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."

337
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,480
Silence.

338
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,886
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?

339
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,128
They're half crazy!

340
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,602
The man who does the check-ups,
the Captain...

341
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,405
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.

342
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,491
He said they're having a dinner
with all the officials and their wives.

343
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,888
He asked me if I wanted to
wait tables at the dinner.

344
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,721
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.

345
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,928
Have you seen Joshua?

346
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,849
What do you mean, no?

347
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,888
What are you doing?
Come here!

348
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,050
- No.
- I told you to come.

349
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,650
No? Come on out!

350
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,041
Come out! Look here.
You're all dirty.

351
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,360
Where have you been?

352
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,967
I had to finish playing rummy.

353
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,924
They make buttons and soap
out of us.

354
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,567
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.

355
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,801
Who told you that?

356
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,528
A man was crying. He said they make
buttons and soap out of us.

357
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,122
You fell for that?

358
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,322
Again?

359
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,603
I thought you were a sharp boy...
cunning, intelligent.

360
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,486
Buttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!

361
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,967
You believed that?

362
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,691
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Bartolomeo...

363
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,370
a good scrub.

364
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,131
Then I'll button up
with Francesco.

365
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,401
Darn it all!

366
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,966
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

367
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,242
Does this look like a person?

368
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,250
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!

369
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,488
What else did they tell you?

370
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,409
That we get cooked in the oven.

371
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,169
They burn us up in the oven.

372
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,690
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!

373
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,962
I've heard of a wood oven...

374
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,003
but I've never seen
a man oven before.

375
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,527
"I'm made of wood!"
"Take this lawyer!"

376
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,007
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.

377
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,690
Look at that smoke!"

378
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,851
Buttons, soap,
we get burned in the oven.

379
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,928
Let's be serious now.

380
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,691
I have a bag race
with the bad guys tomorrow.

381
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,168
That's enough.
I want to go home.

382
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,486
- Now?
- Right now.

383
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,683
It's raining now. You'll come down
with a terrible fever!

384
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,564
I don't care.
Let's go.

385
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,241
All right.
If you want to go...

386
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,289
I'll get our stuff
and we'll leave.

387
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,682
- We can leave?
- Naturally.

388
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,167
What do you think they do,
force people to stay here?

389
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,203
That'll be the day.

390
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,210
Wouldn't that be great?
Let's go. We'll pack our bags...

391
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,846
and get out of here.

392
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,567
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.

393
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,570
Some other kid
will win the real tank.

394
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,524
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.

395
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,723
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!

396
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,285
Where are they then?

397
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,051
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.

398
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,960
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.

399
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,969
How many points do we have?

400
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,082
Almost 687.

401
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,089
I told you a thousand times.

402
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,245
Let's go, though.

403
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,204
- We're winning, but if you want...
- We're winning?

404
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,564
We're first, I told you.
But we'll quit if you want.

405
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,244
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.

406
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,169
Bye, Bartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.

407
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,009
We're fed up here.

408
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,086
The tank is done.
It's ready.

409
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,965
Clean the spark plugs off
before you start it.

410
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,651
Open the throttle...

411
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,730
otherwise the cannon will
get stuck with the tracks.

412
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,845
And the gun. Did you see
how nice it is? It came out beautiful!

413
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:33,567
Lift the emergency brake off
before you move! We're going.

414
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,648
Joshua wants to quit.

415
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,082
We could have gone back with a tank
soon, but we'll take the bus today.

416
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,407
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!

417
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,329
We're tired of this place.

418
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,046
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

419
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,045
Let's go, Joshua.

420
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,967
It's raining. I'll come down
with a terrible fever!

421
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,682
It's me, Pop!

422
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,804
I have to tell you
something important! Come here!

423
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,491
That little rascal's been
running away all morning.

424
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,171
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!

425
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,282
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!

426
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,051
Those creeps want our tank!
Stop!

427
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,491
Wait.

428
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,123
I might have spotted him.

429
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,561
I think he's nearby.

430
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,526
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there.
I'll wait here.

431
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,563
I'll keep a watch out.

432
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,410
He's there, Pop!

433
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,522
- What'd he look like? Blond?
- Yes.

434
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,166
That's him then.
His name is... Schwanz.

435
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,362
He's been in there
for three weeks.

436
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,926
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!

437
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,771
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.

438
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,360
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.

439
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,084
They're all hidden.

440
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,970
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!

441
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,763
Got ya, got ya, got ya!
You're out! Let's go.

442
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,129
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?

443
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,561
She's coming over for you.

444
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,489
Now it's time for
the "be quiet" game.

445
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,365
You're never to speak.

446
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,130
Swear it!

447
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,202
- Swear it!
- I swear.

448
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,441
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.

449
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,006
If we get through this,
the first prize is ours.

450
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,010
They're rounding up everyone in
first place. It's the silence game.

451
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,326
Not a word, got it?

452
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,769
Why are you here
with the children?

453
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,689
Quiet!
You're never to speak.

454
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,286
I swear.

455
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,930
I have to talk to you.
Very important.

456
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,930
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.

457
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,840
Thank you.

458
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,767
I told you not to talk
to the children.

459
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,126
Doctor, my wife is here too.

460
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,211
Slowly.

461
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,766
Eat slowly.
It's bad for you.

462
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,771
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.

463
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,008
The game finishes early.

464
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,964
Don't make a mistake
now that we're in the lead.

465
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,411
Slowly.

466
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,569
So.
Pay attention.

467
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,846
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,
all yellow in reality.

468
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,488
If you ask me what I am...

469
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,206
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'

470
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,088
Walking along I go,
'Poo poo'.

471
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,601
Who am I?
Tell me true."

472
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,649
A duckling, right?

473
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,449
Is it a duckling?

474
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,446
It's not!

475
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,603
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna.

476
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,087
I can't send him mine...

477
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,567
until I solve this one.

478
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,608
I thought...

479
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,848
duck-billed platypus...

480
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,883
but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep."

481
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,207
A duck-billed platypus goes...

482
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,281
I translated it into Italian
for you last night.

483
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,009
Well, what do you say?

484
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,447
Everything points
to a duckling.

485
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,290
Help me.

486
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,802
For heaven's sake...

487
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,968
help me.

488
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,208
I can't even sleep.

489
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,641
It's the duckling!

490
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,050
Come here!

491
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,766
- I'm tired.
- Come here.

492
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,369
Where are we here?

493
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,211
I might have taken
the wrong way.

494
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,290
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams.

495
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,641
Maybe it's only a dream!

496
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,762
We're dreaming, Joshua.

497
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,281
Tomorrow morning
Mommy will come wake us up...

498
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:15,485
and bring us two nice cups
of milk and cookies.

499
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,602
First, we'll eat.

500
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,530
Then I'll make love to her
two or three times...

501
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,850
if I can.

502
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,048
Excuse me, Bartolomeo.

503
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,607
They've called those two officers
20 times. I bet they escaped.

504
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:19,805
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.

505
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,446
The war is over.
They're running all over the place.

506
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,927
Where are those trucks going?

507
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,691
The important thing is
not to get on those trucks.

508
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,882
They leave full
and come back empty.

509
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,809
You know where they're going?

510
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,448
What about the women?
What's going on?

511
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,325
Let's get out of this dump
and split up.

512
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,488
We don't even have
to pack our bags!

513
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,080
I've been hearing
only dogs and machine guns.

514
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,283
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.

515
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,768
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!

516
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,211
So long, guys.
I'm leaving.

517
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,604
Come see.

518
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,326
Look how mad they are!
Furious!

519
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,807
You see?
They're looking for you.

520
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,922
Just for you.
All this is over you!

521
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,963
You're the last one!
The last one to find!

522
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,163
They're even looking
under the rocks!

523
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,931
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.

524
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,169
If they don't find you tonight,
it's worth 60 points!

525
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,964
How many points do we have?

526
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:34,004
We've got 940 points.
Plus 60?

527
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,282
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

528
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,721
They're looking
all over for you.

529
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,081
No mistakes tonight.
This is it!

530
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,488
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.

531
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,329
Who?

532
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,647
The blond boy.

533
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,241
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.

534
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,011
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.

535
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,851
Let's go, quick as lightning.
Come on!

536
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,044
Inside!

537
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,970
Take this blanket
in case you get cold.

538
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,208
I'll be back soon.

539
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,563
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

540
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:44,163
Pop, you scared me to death!

541
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,248
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?

542
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,169
Give me your sweater then.

543
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:51,204
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track.

544
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:54,164
They're looking all over for you!

545
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,760
Everybody's yelling,
"Where's Joshua?"

546
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,362
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

547
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,643
No one will find you.
Bye, now. I'll be back later.

548
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,284
Listen...

549
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,404
if I'm really late coming back...

550
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,284
don't you move.

551
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,483
Don't come out.
You're not to come out...

552
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,922
until it's completely quiet...

553
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,122
and nobody is in sight,
just to be safe.

554
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:21,526
Say it!

555
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,803
I won't come out
until nobody is around.

556
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,843
Good boy, stubborn.

557
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,005
Leave!

558
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,122
Go away, dog!

559
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,163
Go, dog!

560
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,611
Leave.

561
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,565
Good job, Ferruccio.

562
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,569
It works.

563
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,242
Is there anyone
called Dora here?

564
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:23,649
Dora, are you here?
It's Guido.

565
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:28,008
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?

566
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,890
Is there a Dora here?
She's Italian. She's my wife.

567
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,844
Yes, there's a Dora here.

568
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,609
It's me, Dora!

569
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,128
It's not her!
Is there another Dora?

570
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,402
Jump out of the truck
as soon as you can!

571
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,761
Get off! Jump out!

572
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,889
It's true!

573
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,011
Mommy!

574
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,805
This is my story.

575
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,851
This is the sacrifice
my father made.

576
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,287
This was his gift to me.

577
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,687
- We won!
- Yes, we won!

578
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,650
A thousand points
to laugh like crazy about!

579
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:53,281
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!

580
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,687
We won!
