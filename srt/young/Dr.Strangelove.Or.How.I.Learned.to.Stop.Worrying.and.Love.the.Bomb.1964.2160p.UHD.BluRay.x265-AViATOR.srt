1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,420
For more than a year, ominous
rumours had been circulating...

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,839
...among high-level
Western leaders...

3
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:51,843
...that the Soviet Union had been at
work on what was hinted to be...

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,639
...the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,601
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,354
...to the perpetually fog-shrouded
wasteland...

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,816
...below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,317
What they were building...

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,196
...or why it should be located in such
a remote and desolate place...

10
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,657
...no one could say.

11
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,310
-General Ripper, sir.
-Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,480
-This is General Ripper speaking.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,359
-Do you recognise my voice?
-I do, sir. Why do you ask?

14
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,194
Why do you think I ask?

15
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,865
Well, I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

16
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,203
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

17
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,040
-No, I don't, sir, no.
-Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

18
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,502
Has the wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

19
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,380
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have all just come in.

20
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,967
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

21
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,678
The base is being
put on condition red.

22
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,306
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

23
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,684
Condition red. Jolly good idea.
Keeps the men on their toes.

24
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm afraid this is not an exercise.

25
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,981
Not an exercise, sir?

26
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:39,196
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're a
good officer and have a right to know.

27
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,323
It looks like
we're in a shooting war.

28
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,075
Oh, hell.

29
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,245
-Are the Russians involved?
-That's all I've been told.

30
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,209
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

31
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,755
Now, I want you to
transmit Plan R...

32
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,757
...R for Robert, to the wing.

33
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,219
-Plan R for Robert.
-Is it that bad, sir?

34
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,763
-Looks like it's pretty hairy.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,890
Plan R for Robert, sir.

36
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,268
Now, last, and possibly
most important...

37
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,397
...I want all privately-owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

38
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,235
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

39
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,780
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

40
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,617
I want every single one of them
collected without exception.

41
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,078
After you've done that,
report back to me.

42
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,774
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

43
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,818
...America's
Strategic Air Command...

44
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,779
...maintains a large force
of B-52 bombers...

45
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,448
...airborne 24 hours a day.

46
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,453
Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear
bomb load of 50 megatonnes...

47
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:16,167
...equal to 16 times the total explosive
force of all the bombs and shells...

48
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,005
...used by all the armies
in World War II.

49
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,799
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

50
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,927
...Is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

51
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,139
But they have one geographical factor
in common:

52
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,184
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

53
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,017
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,771
...but I just got a message from base
over the CRM 114.

55
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,859
It decodes as wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,158
Goldie, did you say
wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,910
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,750
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys...

59
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,920
...that I don't want
no horsing around on the airplane?

60
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,756
I'm not horsing around, sir,
that's how it decodes.

61
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,135
Well, I've been to one world fair,
a picnic and a rodeo...

62
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,430
...and that's the stupidest thing
I ever heard over earphones.

63
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,432
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,976
Yes, sir, it is.

65
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,603
There's just gotta be
something wrong.

66
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,106
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,935
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,729
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,045
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,173
Give the go code and then recall
to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,344
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,638
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,390
...unless them Russkies had
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,018
...and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,228
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,855
Major Kong, message
from base confirmed.

77
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,571
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,659
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Russkies.

79
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:37,387
Now, look, boys, I ain't much
of a hand at making speeches.

80
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,016
But I got a pretty fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,768
...Is going on back there.

82
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,606
Now, I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,276
...that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

84
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,404
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even be
human beings...

85
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:59,075
...If you didn't have strong personal
feelings about nuclear combat.

86
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,744
But I want you to remember
one thing:

87
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,581
That folks back home
is counting on you...

88
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,250
...and by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

89
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,712
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:16,217
If this thing turns out to be half as
important as I figure it just might be...

91
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,805
...I'd say that you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,100
...and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,145
And that goes for
every last one of you...

94
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,940
...regardless of your race,
colour or your creed.

95
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,777
Now, let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,627
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,670
Yeah, you have to.

98
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,136
Hello?

99
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,138
Yes, General Turgidson is here...

100
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,807
...he can't come
to the phone at the moment.

101
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,185
Well, this is his secretary,
Miss Scott.

102
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,480
Freddie, how are you?

103
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,815
Fine, and you?

104
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,111
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

105
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,365
Well, look, Freddie, he's tied up
at the moment.

106
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,368
I'm afraid
he can't come to the phone.

107
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,786
Just a minute.

108
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,122
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

109
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,124
Tell him to call back.

110
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,879
Freddie, the general says could you
call back in a minute or two?

111
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,881
He says it can't wait.

112
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,301
For Pete's--
Find out what he wants.

113
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,222
Freddie, the thing is, the general
is in the powder room right now.

114
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,683
Could you tell me what it's about?

115
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,893
Just a second.

116
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,188
Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

117
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,233
...from Burpelson Air Force Base.

118
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:01,698
Right. It was directed to the
843rd bomb wing on airborne alert.

119
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,869
It decoded as wing attack Plan R.

120
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:12,500
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
the base commander. Ripper.

121
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,335
Do I have to think of everything?

122
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,007
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

123
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,427
All communications are dead.

124
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,930
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

125
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,518
Freddie, the general asks if
you could possibly try again yourself.

126
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,690
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

127
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,235
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

128
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,703
Fred? Buck. What's it look like?

129
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,748
Yeah?

130
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,127
Well, are you sure it's Plan R?

131
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,967
What's cooking on the threat board?
Nothing? Nothing at all?

132
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,638
I don't like the look of this, Fred.

133
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,100
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

134
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,645
Give Elmo and Charlie a blast.
Bump everything up to condition red.

135
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,106
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

136
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,442
-What's up?
-Nothing, nothing.

137
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,280
-Where's my shorts?
-On the floor. Where are you going?

138
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,115
No place.

139
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,912
I thought I might mosey over to the
war room, see what's doing over there.

140
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,789
It's 3:00 in the morning.

141
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,791
The Air Force never sleeps.

142
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,836
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

143
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,258
I know how it is, baby.

144
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,427
Tell you what you do.

145
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,349
You just start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back here...

146
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,061
...before you can say, "Blastoff!"

147
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,359
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

148
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,487
And for this reason, men,
I want to impress upon you...

149
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,448
...the need
for extreme watchfulness.

150
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,661
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

151
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,497
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

152
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,875
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,796
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

154
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,175
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

155
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,721
First: trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

156
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,349
...unless he is known
to you personally.

157
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,227
Second: anyone or anything...

158
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,232
...that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

159
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:46,904
Third: if in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

160
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,366
I would sooner accept
a few casualties through accident...

161
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,579
...than lose the entire base and
its personnel through carelessness.

162
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:59,333
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

163
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,712
Now, men, in conclusion...

164
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,841
...I would like to say
that in the two years...

165
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,720
...It has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

166
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,723
...I have always expected
the best from you...

167
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,685
...and you have never given me
anything less than that.

168
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,939
Today the nation is counting on us.

169
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,026
We are not going to let them down.

170
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,236
Good luck to you all.

171
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,436
Here's the attack profile, sir.

172
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,258
This is your attack profile.

173
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,594
"To ensure that the enemy cannot
monitor voice transmission...

174
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,805
...or plant false transmission...

175
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,977
...the CRM 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

176
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,522
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

177
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,983
...on the dials of the CRM.

178
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,654
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix.

179
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,366
Stand by to set code prefix.

180
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,868
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

181
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,495
Set code prefix.

182
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,633
-Code prefix set.
-Lock code prefix.

183
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,679
Code prefix locked.

184
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,308
Switch all receiver circuits
to CRM discriminators.

185
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,687
All circuits switched
to CRM discriminators.

186
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,398
Check auto-destruct circuits.

187
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,902
Auto-destruct circuits checked.

188
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,662
Primary target:
the ICBM complex at Laputa.

189
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:48,085
Target reference:
Yankee-Golf-Tango, 360.

190
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,258
Thirty-megatonne nuclear device
fused for airburst at 10,000 feet.

191
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,846
Twenty-megatonne nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

192
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,557
Otherwise, proceed
to secondary target:

193
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,686
Missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

194
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,732
Target reference:
November-Bravo-X-ray...

195
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,234
...108.

196
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,698
Fused airburst at 10--
Check, 12,000 feet.

197
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,797
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

198
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,800
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

199
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,597
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to test our readiness.

200
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,599
I think it's taking things too far.

201
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,936
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in 20 minutes.

202
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,606
Listen to that. Chock-a-block
full of stations, all churning it out.

203
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,609
-Mandrake?
-Yes, sir?

204
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,946
I thought I issued instructions
for all radios to be impounded.

205
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,325
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

206
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,121
I thought, our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

207
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:09,625
...I'd better tell you. Because if
they do, it'll cause a bit of a stink.

208
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,754
Group captain,
the officer-exchange programme...

209
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,466
...does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

210
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,762
I realise that, sir, but I thought you'd
be rather pleased to hear the news.

211
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,598
I mean, after all....
Well, let's face it.

212
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,686
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to, do we?

213
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,274
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

214
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,483
Yes, sir.

215
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,026
What about the planes?

216
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,488
Surely we must issue
the recall code immediately.

217
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,366
Group captain, the planes
are not gonna be recalled.

218
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,036
My attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand.

219
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,542
If you'll excuse me saying so, sir,
that would be, to my way of thinking...

220
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
...rather an odd way
of looking at it.

221
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,213
If a Russian attack
was in progress...

222
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,217
...we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,179
-Are you certain of that?
-I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,556
And what if it is true?

225
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,185
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because, I mean....

226
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,022
If a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:18,360
...then your use of Plan R-- In fact,
your orders to the entire wing....

228
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:30,247
I would say that there was something
dreadfully wrong somewhere.

229
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,667
Why don't you take it easy,
group captain?

230
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,587
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,256
...and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,061
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,397
...it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:55,523 --> 00:22:00,110
...to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the wing.

235
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,279
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,541
Sir, I must ask you for the key
and the recall code.

237
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,751
Have you got them handy?

238
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,295
I told you to take it easy,
group captain.

239
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,923
There's nothing anybody can do
about this now.

240
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,425
I'm the only person who knows
the code group.

241
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,720
Then I must insist, sir,
that you give them to me!

242
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,233
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

243
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:45,573
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

244
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,243
...that while we're chatting here
So enjoyably...

245
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,163
...a decision is being made
by the president...

246
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,458
...and the joint chiefs in the war room
at the Pentagon.

247
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:03,090
And when they realise there is
no possibility of recalling the wing...

248
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,594
...there will be only one course
of action open:

249
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,471
Total commitment.

250
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:17,187
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

251
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,190
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

252
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,862
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

253
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,867
When he said that, 50 years ago...

254
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,536
...he might have been right.

255
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,997
But today...

256
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,500
...war is too important
to be left to politicians.

257
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,047
They have neither the time,
the training...

258
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,216
...nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

259
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,349
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

260
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:58,562
...Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

261
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,148
...Communist subversion...

262
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,569
...and the international
Communist conspiracy...

263
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,530
...to sap and impuirify...

264
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:12,034
...all of our precious bodily fluids.

265
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,541
Staines, is everybody here?

266
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,336
Mr President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

267
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,256
The secretary of defence is in Laos,
the vice president is in Mexico City.

268
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,343
We can establish contact with them
at any time.

269
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,261
The undersecretaries are all here.

270
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,515
Right. Now, General Turgidson,
what's going on here?

271
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,560
Mr President...

272
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:42,272
...about 35 minutes ago...

273
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,360
...General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

274
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,862
...of Burpelson Air Force Base...

275
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,199
...Issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his wing...

276
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,410
...which were airborne
at the time...

277
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,580
...as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

278
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,419
Now, it appears that the order
called for the planes...

279
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,880
...to attack their targets
inside Russia.

280
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:11,135
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

281
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,763
...with an average load
of 40 megatonnes each.

282
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:19,393
Now, the central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

283
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,981
The triangles
are their primary targets.

284
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,985
The squares
are their secondary targets.

285
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,449
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

286
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,746
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

287
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,749
I was under the impression
I was the only one in authority...

288
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,293
...to order the use of
nuclear weapons.

289
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,465
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorised to do so.

290
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,844
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

291
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,514
...it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

292
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:02,478
It certainly does. Far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

293
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,190
Well, perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

294
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,150
Plan R?

295
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,988
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

296
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,657
...In which a lower-echelon
commander may order...

297
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,869
...nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

298
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,456
...if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

299
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,501
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

300
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,172
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort...

301
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,842
...made that big hassle about
our deterrent lacking credibility.

302
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,639
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

303
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,682
A safeguard?

304
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:44,019
I admit the human element
seems to have failed us here.

305
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,481
But the idea was to discourage
the Russkies from any hope...

306
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,067
...they could knock out Washington,
and yourself...

307
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,194
...as part of a sneak attack...

308
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,406
...and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control.

309
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,201
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

310
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,079
...once they reach their
fail-safe points.

311
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,917
No, sir, I'm afraid not. The planes
were holding at their fail-safe points...

312
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,710
...when the go code was issued.

313
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,048
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

314
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,592
They will continue
until they reach their target.

315
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,888
Then why haven't you radioed the
planes, countermanding the go code?

316
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm afraid we're unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft.

317
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,185
Why?

318
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,230
As you may recall, sir...

319
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,900
...one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

320
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:36,572
...that once the go code
is received...

321
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,950
...the normal SSB radios
in the aircraft...

322
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,536
...are switched into
a special coded device...

323
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,455
...which I believe is designated
as CRM 114.

324
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,624
Now, in order
to prevent the enemy...

325
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,127
...from issuing fake
or confusing orders...

326
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:54,131
...CRM 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

327
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,550
...unless the message is preceded...

328
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,761
...by the correct three-letter
code group prefix.

329
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:05,142
Do you mean to tell me, general, you
will be unable to recall the aircraft?

330
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,228
That's the size of it.
However, we are ploughing through...

331
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,148
...every possible three-letter
combination of the code.

332
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:16,445
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

333
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,115
...it's going to take us about two days
to transmit them all.

334
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,951
How soon will planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

335
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,496
-Eighteen minutes from now.
-Are you in contact with Ripper?

336
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:31,460
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

337
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,796
-Where did you get this information?
-General Ripper called...

338
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:39,468
...Strategic Air Command headquarters
shortly after he issued the go code.

339
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:43,013
I have a portion of the transcript,
if you'd like me to read it.

340
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,098
Read it.

341
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,436
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

342
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,649
...to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

343
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:58,195
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

344
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,114
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

345
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,825
...I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

346
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:08,830
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

347
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:14,211
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1400 megatonnes' worth.

348
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,839
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

349
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,801
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

350
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,722
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

351
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,184
...and in true health
through the purity...

352
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,146
...and essence of our natural...

353
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,690
...fluids.

354
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,693
God bless you all.”

355
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,405
Then he hung up.

356
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,867
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase.

357
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:50,247
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

358
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:55,419
I'd like to hold off judgement on a thing
like that, sir, until all the facts are in.

359
00:29:55,544 --> 00:30:00,090
General Turgidson, when you
instituted the human reliability tests...

360
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,592
...you assured me there was
no possibility...

361
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,095
...of such a thing ever occurring.

362
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,183
Well, I don't think it's quite fair
to condemn the whole programme...

363
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,894
...because of a single slip-up, sir.

364
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,522
I wanna speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

365
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,107
I'm afraid that's impossible.

366
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,069
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

367
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,781
...in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

368
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,285
-General Faceman.
-Yes, sir?

369
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,954
Are there any Army units
stationed near Burpelson?

370
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,206
I'll just check, sir.

371
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,463
Hello?

372
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,259
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

373
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,264
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

374
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,933
My president needs me.

375
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,645
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

376
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,816
Of course it isn't only physical.

377
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,402
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

378
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,614
Someday I'm gonna make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

379
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,659
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

380
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,662
Bucky will be back there
just as soon as he can.

381
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,459
All right. Listen, sug,
don't forget to say your prayers.

382
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,303
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

383
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,181
...Is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

384
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,519
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

385
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,979
...and put him
in immediate contact with me.

386
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,689
Yes, sir.

387
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,859
Mr President, if I may advise.

388
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:47,447
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure the base be sealed off...

389
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,283
...and the base defended
by base security troops.

390
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,788
Any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

391
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,708
General Turgidson, with all due
respect for your defence team...

392
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,711
...my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

393
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:07,425
Mr President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

394
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,886
Go ahead, general.

395
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:16,059
One: our hopes for recalling
the 843rd bomb wing...

396
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,397
...are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

397
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,358
Two: in less than 15 minutes
from now...

398
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,570
...the Russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

399
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,697
Three: when they do...

400
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,367
...they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

401
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,371
Four: if, prior to this time...

402
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,000
...we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

403
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,711
...we will suffer virtual annihilation.

404
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,754
Now...

405
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,758
five:

406
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,428
If, on the other hand...

407
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:58,185
...we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

408
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,730
...we'd stand a good chance of
catching them with their pants down.

409
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,065
We've got a 5-to-1
missile superiority.

410
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,110
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

411
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,906
...and still have an effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

412
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:16,036
Six: an unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

413
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:21,041
...indicated that we would destroy
90 percent of their nuclear capabilities.

414
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,251
We would therefore prevail...

415
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:27,422
...and suffer only modest civilian
casualties from their remaining force...

416
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,967
...which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated.

417
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,304
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

418
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,765
...never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

419
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,561
Well, Mr President, I'd say Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

420
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:46,107
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

421
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,818
Mr President...

422
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,113
...we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth...

423
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:55,116
...both for ourselves
and for the life of our nation.

424
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,827
Now, truth is not always
a pleasant thing.

425
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,455
But it is necessary now
to make a choice.

426
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,291
To choose between two
admittedly regrettable...

427
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,836
...but nevertheless distinguishable,
postwar environments.

428
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,005
One where 20 million people
are Killed.

429
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,675
The other, 150 million people killed.

430
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,761
You're talking about mass murder,
general, not war.

431
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,431
Mr President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

432
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,144
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed, tops.

433
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,188
Depending on the breaks.

434
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,276
I will not go down in history as the
greatest mass murderer since Hitler.

435
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,820
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

436
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,323
...with the American people than
with your image in history books.

437
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,451
General Turgidson, I've heard
quite sufficient from you.

438
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,370
Thank you very much.

439
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,540
Mr President, they have
the ambassador upstairs.

440
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,210
-Oh, good. Any difficulty?
-He's having a fit about the MPs.

441
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,796
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here.

442
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,381
Yes, sir.

443
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,009
Is that the Russian ambassador?

444
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,177
Yes, it is, general.

445
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,182
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

446
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,685
...Is to be admitted entrance
to the war room?

447
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,688
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

448
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,818
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

449
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,238
...but are you aware of what
a breach of security that would be?

450
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,534
I mean, he'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

451
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:25,081
That is precisely the idea, general.
That is precisely the idea.

452
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,545
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

453
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:41,556
Survival kit contents check.

454
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,436
In them, you will find
one .45-calibre automatic...

455
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,064
...two boxes of ammunition...

456
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,525
...four days' concentrated
emergency rations...

457
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,862
...one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

458
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,325
...morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

459
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,204
...Sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...

460
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,084
One miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

461
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,087
...$100 in rubles...

462
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,422
...$100 in gold...

463
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,758
...hine packs of chewing gum...

464
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,260
...one issue of prophylactics...

465
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,139
...three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings.

466
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:28,144
Shoot, a fella could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

467
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,403
-You don't have any fresh fish?
-I'm afraid not, sir.

468
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,655
-Your eggs are fresh?
-Oh, yes, sir.

469
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,198
I will have poached eggs.

470
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,659
And bring me some cigars, please.
Havana cigars.

471
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,162
And that will be all for you, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

472
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,457
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
ambassador. They're good.

473
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,961
Thank you, no. I do not support
the work of imperialist stooges.

474
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,630
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

475
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,007
Mr President.

476
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,804
You're gonna let that lousy Commie
punk vomit all over us like this?

477
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,847
Mr President?

478
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,642
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

479
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,812
...and he won't be back
for another two hours.

480
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,356
-Try B86543 Moscow.
-Yes, sir.

481
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,817
You'd never have found him
through his office.

482
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,779
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

483
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,532
-Degenerate, atheistic Commie.
-What did you say?

484
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,161
I said, Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate, atheistic Commie!

485
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,164
-Have this ignorant fool--
-I'm sorry!

486
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,209
Mr President,
I think they're trying the number.

487
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,973
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the war room!

488
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,851
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

489
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,938
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

490
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,858
You bet your sweets, Mr Commie!
Look at this.

491
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,446
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this, of the big board!

492
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,490
Mr Ambassador!

493
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:08,036
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

494
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,914
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

495
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,210
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behaviour in the war room.

496
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,713
Mr President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

497
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,742
You gotta hand it to
those Commies.

498
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,410
Yeah.

499
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,288
Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

500
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,290
I wonder
where they got them from.

501
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,752
Probably bought them
from the Army as war surplus.

502
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,509
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

503
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,361
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

504
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,698
...but please don't tell him
anything more than that.

505
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:13,536
Alexi? Alexi, please. I beg you.

506
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,372
But I don't have a phone.

507
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,583
Give him your phone, Frank.

508
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:50,239
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

509
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:57,664
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

510
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,540
Listen, I can't hear too well.

511
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,419
Do you suppose you could
turn the music down just a little?

512
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,421
Oh, that's much better.

513
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,341
Yeah. Yes.

514
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,345
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

515
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,890
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

516
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:20,395
I'm coming through fine too?
Good. Then....

517
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,399
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

518
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,736
Well, it's good that you're fine
and I'm fine.

519
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,115
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

520
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,118
Now then, Dimitri...

521
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:40,915
...you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

522
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,751
...of something going wrong
with the bomb.

523
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,088
The bomb, Dimitri.

524
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,883
The hydrogen bomb.

525
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,928
Well, now, what happened is...

526
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:58,224
...one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of--

527
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,477
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

528
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,647
You know, just a little funny.

529
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,318
And he went and did a silly thing.

530
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,823
Well, I'll tell you what he did.
He ordered his planes...

531
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,952
...to attack your country.

532
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,455
Well, let me finish, Dimitri.

533
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,332
Let me finish, Dimitri.

534
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,627
Well, listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

535
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,630
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

536
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:35,470
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?

537
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,848
Of course I like to speak to you!

538
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,476
Of course I like to say hello!

539
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,686
Not now, but any time, Dimitri.

540
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,815
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

541
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,860
Of course it's a friendly call.

542
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,323
Listen, if it wasn't friendly, you
probably wouldn't have even got it.

543
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:02,330
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

544
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,500
I am-- I am positive, Dimitri.

545
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,002
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

546
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,546
It is not a trick.

547
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,048
Well, I'll tell you.

548
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,010
We'd like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

549
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,347
...the flight plans and the
defensive systems of the planes.

550
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:24,352
Yes, I mean, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

551
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,146
...then I'd say that, well...

552
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,860
...we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

553
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,863
I know they're our boys.

554
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,533
All right, listen.
Now, who should we call?

555
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:45,498
Who should we call, Dimitri?
Sorry, you faded away there.

556
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,877
The People's Central
Air Defence Headquarters.

557
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,213
Where is that, Dimitri?

558
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,507
In Omsk. Right.

559
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,759
Yes.

560
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,804
Oh, you'll call them first, will you?

561
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,225
Do you happen to have
the phone number on you, Dimitri?

562
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,105
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

563
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:15,236
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

564
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,240
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

565
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,744
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

566
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,746
Don't say that you're more sorry...

567
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,791
...because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

568
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,336
So we're both sorry, all right?
All right.

569
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,842
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

570
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,607
What?

571
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,586
What? What is it? What?

572
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,756
The fools. The mad fools.

573
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,926
What's happened?

574
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,637
The doomsday machine.

575
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,306
The doom--? The doomsday machine?
What is that?

576
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:30,770
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

577
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,147
All human and animal life?

578
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,331
-Mandrake?
-Yes, Jack?

579
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,961
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

580
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:59,674
Well, no, I can't say I have, Jack.

581
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,680
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

582
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:10,142
Well, I believe that's
what they drink, Jack, yes.

583
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,688
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

584
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,148
...and not without good reason.

585
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,819
Oh, yes.

586
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:25,992
I can't quite see
what you're getting at, Jack.

587
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,870
Water.
That's what I'm getting at, water.

588
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,375
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

589
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,422
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

590
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,966
Why, do you realise that...

591
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,928
...70 percent of you is water?

592
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,430
Good Lord.

593
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,685
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

594
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,355
...to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

595
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,233
-You beginning to understand?
-Yes.

596
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,572
Mandrake....

597
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:11,746
Mandrake, have you never wondered
why I drink only distilled water...

598
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,250
...0r rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

599
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,628
Well, it did occur to me, Jack, yes.

600
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:25,468
Have you ever heard of a thing called
fluoridation? Fluoridation of water?

601
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,597
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.
Yes.

602
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,599
Well, do you know what it is?

603
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,769
No. No, I don't know what it is, no.

604
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,773
Do you realise that fluoridation...

605
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,650
...Is the most
monstrously conceived...

606
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:45,279
...and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

607
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,162
Two can play at that game, soldier.

608
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,836
That's nice shooting, soldier!

609
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,321
Mandrake, come here.

610
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,365
You calling me, Jack?

611
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,992
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

612
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,957
I haven't had
very much experience...

613
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,835
...you know,
with those sort of machines, Jack...

614
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,505
...I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

615
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,551
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed the belt.

616
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:53,222
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

617
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,183
...the string in my leg's gone.

618
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,812
-The what?
-The string. I never told you...

619
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:05,151
...but, you see, I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

620
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,823
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming. Come on!

621
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:16,036
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

622
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,038
...So that in 10 months...

623
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,208
...the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon.

624
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,086
Come on, de Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

625
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,255
Our studies show
even the worst fallout...

626
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,507
...iIs down to a safe level
after two weeks.

627
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,344
You've obviously never heard
of cobalt thorium G.

628
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,762
No, what about it?

629
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,725
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

630
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,895
If you take, say, 50 H bombs
in the 100 megatonne range...

631
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,355
...and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

632
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,068
...when they are exploded, they will
produce a doomsday shroud...

633
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,404
...a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

634
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,909
...which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

635
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,621
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all....

636
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,082
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

637
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,086
Is the premier threatening to
explode it if we carry out the attack?

638
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,464
No. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

639
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,926
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

640
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,969
But surely you can
disarm it somehow.

641
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,973
No. It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

642
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,308
Automatically?

643
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,977
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

644
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,314
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

645
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,902
But this is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

646
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,654
Some of us fought against it.

647
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,407
But we could not keep up with the
expense involved in the arms race...

648
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,661
...the space race
and the peace race.

649
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,288
At the same time,
our people grumbled...

650
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,958
...for more nylons
and washing machines.

651
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,627
Our doomsday scheme cost us
a small fraction...

652
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,838
...of what we had been spending
on defence in a single year.

653
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,800
The deciding factor was
when we learned your country...

654
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,428
...was working along similar lines.
We were afraid of a doomsday gap.

655
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,848
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

656
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,768
Our source was
The New York Times.

657
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:07,022
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

658
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,025
A moment, please, Mr President.

659
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,823
Under the authority granted me...

660
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,868
...as director of weapons research
and development...

661
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:24,331
...I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

662
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,625
...by the Bland Corporation.

663
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,545
Based on the findings
of the report...

664
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:35,217
...my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

665
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,346
...for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

666
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,850
Then you mean it is possible
for them to have built such a thing?

667
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:51,859
Mr President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

668
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:56,322
...of even the smallest
nuclear power.

669
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:01,201
It requires only the will to do so.

670
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,913
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

671
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,541
...and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

672
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,712
Mr President,
it is not only possible...

673
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,714
...it is essential.

674
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,218
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

675
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:23,515
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

676
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,185
...the fear to attack.

677
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,190
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

678
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:35,110
...which rules out
human meddling...

679
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,198
...the doomsday machine
is terrifying.

680
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,367
This is simple to understand.

681
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,620
And completely credible
and convincing.

682
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,790
Gee, I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines, Stainesy.

683
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:52,211
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

684
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:56,090
Well, it's remarkably simple
to do that.

685
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,635
When you merely wish
to bury bombs...

686
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,096
...there's no limit to the size.

687
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:08,310
After that, they are connected
to a gigantic complex of computers.

688
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:14,274
Now, then: a specific and
clearly-defined set of circumstances...

689
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,820
...under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

690
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,949
...Is programmed into
a tape memory bank.

691
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,911
-A single roll of tape can store....
-Strangelove.

692
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,248
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

693
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,625
He changed it
when he became a citizen.

694
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,336
It used to be Merkwdurdigliebe.

695
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:39,174
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
huh, Stainesy?

696
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,347
--is that the whole point of
the doomsday machine...

697
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,017
...Is lost if you keep it a secret.

698
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,270
Why didn't you tell the world?

699
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,691
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

700
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,153
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

701
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,912
Stay with me, Mandrake.

702
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,753
All right, Mandrake, now feed me.
Feed me bullets.

703
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:32,621
Jack, don't you think we'd be better off
away from all this flying glass?

704
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,873
No, we're okay here.

705
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,128
Mandrake, do you realise that in
addition to fluoridating water, why...

706
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,757
...there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

707
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:48,887
...fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

708
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,472
Ice cream, Mandrake.

709
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,975
-Children's ice cream.
-Good Lord.

710
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,269
You know when fluoridation
first began?

711
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,313
No, I don't, Jack.

712
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,774
1946.

713
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,610
1946, Mandrake.

714
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,948
How does that coincide with your
postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

715
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,326
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

716
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:16,957
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

717
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,294
...without the knowledge
of the individual.

718
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:23,088
Certainly without any choice.

719
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,467
That's the way
a hard-core Commie works.

720
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,014
Jack. Listen, tell me--
Tell me, Jack.

721
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:37,686
When did you first become--
Well, develop this theory?

722
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,981
Well, I....

723
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,610
I first became aware of it,
Mandrake...

724
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,529
...during the physical act of love.

725
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:52,701
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

726
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,329
...a feeling of emptiness followed.

727
00:56:55,954 --> 00:57:00,000
Luckily, I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

728
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,294
Loss of essence.

729
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,549
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

730
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,803
Women sense my power...

731
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,640
...and they seek the life essence.

732
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,560
-I do not avoid women, Mandrake.
-No.

733
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,521
But I do deny them my essence.

734
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,524
Yes, yes, Jack.

735
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,331
Cease fire!

736
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,229
My boys must have surrendered.

737
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,606
Well, there it is.

738
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,566
Now, Jack, listen.

739
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:10,028
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the wing and--

740
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,409
Those boys were like my children,
Mandrake.

741
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:20,080
-Now they let me down.
-No, no, Jack, not a bit of it.

742
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,208
No, I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

743
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,794
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

744
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,588
...every man jack of them, Jack.

745
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,258
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

746
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,760
One can never be too sure
about those things.

747
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,722
But you look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

748
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,599
You look at me, Jack. Look.

749
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:43,770
And I drink a lot of water, you know.
I'm what you might call a water man.

750
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,149
And I can swear to you,
my boy, swear to you...

751
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:52,112
...that there's nothing wrong with
my bodily fluids. Not a thing, Jackie.

752
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,448
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

753
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:58,160
Well, Jack,
the time's running very--

754
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,329
-What?
-Were you ever a prisoner of war?

755
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,498
Yes, I was,
as a matter of fact, Jack.

756
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,668
Did they torture you?

757
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,255
Yes, they did. I was tortured
by the Japanese, if you must know.

758
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,175
-Not a pretty story.
-What happened?

759
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,512
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think of under these conditions.

760
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,848
Well, what happened was...

761
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,310
...they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

762
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,773
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

763
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,151
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

764
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,821
No, I....

765
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:39,159
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

766
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,329
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swines.

767
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,999
The strange thing is they make
such bloody good cameras.

768
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,003
Those clowns outside
are gonna give me...

769
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,507
...a pretty good going-over
in a few minutes for the code.

770
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,133
Yes--

771
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,888
Yes, well, you may have....
May have quite a point there, Jack.

772
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,725
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

773
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,062
Well, of course, the answer to that is,
boy, no one ever does.

774
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:11,316
And my advice to you, Jack,
is to give me the code now.

775
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,236
And if those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

776
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,864
...we'll fight them together,
like we did just now on the floor.

777
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,201
You with your gun and me with a belt
and the ammo, feeding you.

778
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,329
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

779
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,832
You know, Mandrake...

780
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,210
...I happen to believe in a life
after this one...

781
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,090
...and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

782
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,385
And I think I can.

783
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,888
Yes, well, of course you can, Jack.
Of course you can. You can.

784
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,224
I'm a religious man myself,
you know, Jack.

785
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,103
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack....

786
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,064
You've dropped your gun, Jack.
Yes.... You know what...?

787
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,734
No, Jack, let me take that for you.
I'll take that for you, Jack.

788
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,072
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code.

789
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,701
And-- You're going to have a wash
and brush up? What a good idea.

790
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,370
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

791
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,290
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvellous.

792
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,084
That's what we need,
water on the neck and the code.

793
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,713
Now, supposing I play a little
guessing game with you, Jack, boy.

794
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,591
I'll try and guess
what the code is--

795
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:38,987
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

796
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,073
We have 109,000 total...

797
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,951
...79,000 in the mains...

798
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,829
...and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

799
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,831
And that works out
to roughly...

800
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:53,376
...seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

801
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:59,174
DSO to captain. I have
an unidentified radar blip.

802
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,178
Distance, 60 miles.

803
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,474
Approximate speed, Mach 3.

804
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,018
Looks like a missile tracking us.

805
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,650
Confirmed, definite missile track.
Commence evasive action right.

806
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,825
Missile still closing range.

807
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:30,538
Distance, 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,832
Lock ECM to target intercept mode.

809
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:37,045
ECM locked to
target intercept mode.

810
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,547
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

811
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,718
Range, 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

812
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,850
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

813
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,396
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

814
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,481
Range, 30 miles.

815
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,904
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

816
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,414
Range, 20 miles.

817
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,376
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

818
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,878
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

819
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,381
Range gate on maximum scan.

820
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,342
Range, 10 miles.

821
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,388
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

822
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,725
Deflection increasing.
Range, eight miles.

823
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,729
Deflection still increasing.
Range, six miles.

824
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,481
Missile still deflecting.
Range, four miles.

825
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,449
Range, two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

826
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,909
Range, one mile.
Missile detonated!

827
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,543
-Start lever to cutoff!
-Cutoff!

828
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,506
Essential power!

829
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,225
Re-select essential power!

830
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,311
Essential power re-selected.

831
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,861
The hatch is stuck!

832
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,450
-Hit emergency power!
-Roger!

833
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,205
-Extinguishers!
-Roger!

834
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,173
-Transfer switches!
-Transferred!

835
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,550
-Boost pumps off!
-Cut off!

836
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,314
Fuel valves three, four and six!

837
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,454
-Give me full power!
-Roger.

838
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,345
"Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth."

839
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,059
P-O-E.

840
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,020
"Purity of Essence."

841
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:44,691
O-P-O-E.

842
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:45,900
O-P-E.

843
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,370
Put your hands over your head.

844
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,748
What the devil do you think
you're doing? Who are you?

845
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,709
Put your hands over your head.

846
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,379
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

847
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,423
What do you mean, suit?

848
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,925
This happens to be
an RAF uniform, sir.

849
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,261
And I am Group Captain
Lionel Mandrake...

850
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,388
...General Ripper's
executive officer.

851
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,931
Where's General Ripper?

852
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,893
He's dead, in the bathroom.

853
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,688
-Where's the bathroom?
-Next to you.

854
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,575
I don't know what stupid game
you're playing...

855
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,119
...but I've got an idea
what the recall code is.

856
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,580
I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters.

857
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:44,417
I said, put your hands over your head
and keep them there. Go on.

858
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,127
-Got any witnesses?
-Withesses?

859
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,171
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

860
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,256
While he was shaving, huh?

861
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:56,054
Now, look, Colonel "Bat" Guano,
if that really is your name...

862
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,974
...may I tell you that I have
a very, very good idea...

863
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,102
...I think, I hope, I pray,
what the recall code is.

864
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,979
It's some theme he kept repeating.

865
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:09,150
A variation on "Peace on Earth"
or "Purity of Essence," one of those.

866
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:13,112
Put your hands up on top of
your head. Start walking.

867
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,407
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

868
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,827
...and sent the whole wing
to attack the Soviets?

869
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,456
-What are you talking about?
-I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

870
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,627
I'm gonna pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

871
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,671
...and I hope--

872
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,840
Blast. Blast.

873
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:37,720
Shot away, I expect, by one of your
men during this ridiculous fighting!

874
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,348
Right.

875
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,851
All right, Charlie, I've been
wasting too much time on you.

876
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,730
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walking.

877
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,715
All the radio gear is out,
including the CRM 114.

878
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,051
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

879
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,851
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

880
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,396
Everything seems to
check out all right. Will advise.

881
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,189
Roger. Navigator?

882
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:35,528
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 162 per minute.

883
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,573
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

884
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,035
...primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

885
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,873
...repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

886
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:52,587
However, we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship Tango Delta...

887
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:56,007
...grid coordinates 003 691.

888
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,097
Well, boys,
we got three engines out...

889
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,768
...we got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule...

890
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,187
...the radio is gone
and we're leaking fuel.

891
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,607
If we was flying any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

892
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,693
But we got one little budge
on them Russkies.

893
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,779
At this height,
they might harpoon us...

894
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,865
...but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

895
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,961
The other way.

896
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,464
-Where are you taking me?
-To the main gate.

897
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,299
Colonel!

898
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,969
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

899
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,971
-You wanna know what I think?
-Yes.

900
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,766
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

901
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,560
I think Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

902
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:54,107
...and that you were organising some
kind of mutiny of preverts. Now, move!

903
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,652
I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

904
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:01,781
I was told get Ripper on the phone
with the president of the United States.

905
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:06,494
Now, just one second.
You just said, "The president."

906
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,788
What about the president?

907
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,999
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

908
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,627
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

909
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,004
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

910
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,007
...S0 the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

911
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:23,845
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

912
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,681
You wanna talk to
the president of the United States?

913
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:29,642
I don't want to talk to him,
I've got to talk to him.

914
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,354
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

915
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,483
...the court of enquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

916
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:41,654
...you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

917
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,326
Okay. Go ahead.

918
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,913
Try and get the president
of the United States on the phone.

919
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,294
If you try any preversions in there,
I'll blow your head off.

920
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,143
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

921
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,395
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

922
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,399
Something urgent has come up and I
want you to place an emergency call...

923
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,569
...with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

924
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,199
Burpelson 39180.

925
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:32,413
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The president of the United States.

926
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,374
Oh, I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

927
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,878
Could you make this
a collect call, operator?

928
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,267
Just one second, operator.

929
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,229
They won't accept the call.
Have you got 55 cents?

930
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,524
You don't think I'd go into combat with
loose change in my pocket, do you?

931
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,779
Operator, look.

932
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,407
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

933
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,244
Well, what do you call it?
You know....

934
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,372
Oh, station-to-station.

935
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,963
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

936
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,218
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

937
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:31,430
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

938
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,599
There may be some change
in there.

939
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,604
That's private property.

940
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:41,607
Can you possibly imagine
what is gonna happen to you...

941
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,443
...your frame, outlook,
way of life and everything...

942
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:48,948
...when they learn you have obstructed
a telephone call to the president?

943
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,992
Can you imagine?

944
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,953
Shoot it off! Shoot with the gun!

945
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,747
That's what the bullets are for,
you twit!

946
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,293
Okay. I'm gonna get
your money for you.

947
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,545
But if you don't get the president
on the phone...

948
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,463
-...know what's gonna happen?
-What?

949
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,551
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

950
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:17,351
This is SAC
Communications Control.

951
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:20,354
This is SAC
Communications Control.

952
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,858
The recall code O-P-E...

953
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:30,323
...Is being acknowledged "roger"
by elements of the 843 bomb wing.

954
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,867
These are the details:

955
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:37,538
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

956
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,167
...are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

957
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,379
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

958
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,550
This is SAC Communications Control,
over and out.

959
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,552
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

960
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,013
Gentlemen.

961
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,015
Mr President.

962
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,184
I'm not a sentimentalist
by nature...

963
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:01,520
...but I think I know
what's in every heart in this room.

964
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:05,399
I think we ought to all
just bow our heads...

965
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:09,153
...and give a short prayer of thanks
for our deliverance. Lord...

966
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:14,700
...we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

967
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,536
...fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

968
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,539
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil--

969
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,249
Excuse me, sir.

970
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,419
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

971
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:36,097
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

972
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:40,267
Now works out at 205.

973
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:47,775
Estimate remaining fuel
at 8790.

974
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:54,448
Roger. Confirm 205 per minute...

975
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:58,577
...and remaining fuel 8790.

976
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:09,255
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

977
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,382
No, I'm certain of that.

978
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,552
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

979
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,472
Just a second.
You know what he says?

980
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,933
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

981
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:23,894
According to information
forwarded by our air staffs...

982
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,689
...it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

983
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,488
That's impossible, Mr President.
I mean, look at the big board.

984
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,908
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

985
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,828
...and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

986
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,126
Dimitri, look, we've got an
acknowledgement from every plane...

987
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,337
...except the four
you've shot down.

988
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,680
He-- Hang on a second, Dimitri.

989
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,476
He says their air defence now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

990
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,020
The fourth may only be damaged.

991
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:12,526
Mr President, I'm beginning to smell
a big, fat, Commie rat.

992
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,322
I mean, supposing Kissoff
is lying about that fourth plane...

993
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,699
...just looking for an excuse
to clobber us.

994
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,036
If the spaghetti hits the fan now,
we're in trouble.

995
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,875
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

996
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,629
...and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

997
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,883
...Is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

998
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,180
Are you sure?

999
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:46,894
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

1000
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,022
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1001
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:54,068
...but they're trained to do it,
you know? It's initiative.

1002
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,572
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:03,077
...and I'm sure your entire air defence
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,914
Listen, it's not gonna help
either one of us...

1005
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,209
...if the doomsday machine
goes off, now, is it?

1006
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:16,423
Dimitri, there's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1007
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:20,719
Dimitri. Keep your feet on the ground
while you're talking, Dimitri.

1008
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,055
I am not-- I am not getting--

1009
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,560
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried,
that's all.

1010
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,688
Look, if our air staff say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,733
...and its secondary target is
Borchov, I mean, it's true, Dimitri.

1012
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,193
You've gotta believe it!

1013
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,030
Look, can I--? Dimitri, can I give
you just one word--?

1014
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:43,409
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,119
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,747
Put everything you've got into those
two sectors and you can't miss!

1017
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,799
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,720
...I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,598
...which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,560
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me
that you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:13,480
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,316
...not at 205.

1023
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,735
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,904
...just get me to the primary,
you hear?

1025
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,449
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:26,785
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,996
Well, shoot!

1028
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,917
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,461
What's the nearest target
of opportunity?

1030
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:47,014
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,851
...we have a chance
to reach target 384...

1032
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:55,773
...grid coordinate 003 691...

1033
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:59,693
...and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,862
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,866
Sir, that's the ICBM
complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:11,705
All right.
Designating new target: 384.

1037
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,833
Give me a heading on that as soon
as you get it worked out.

1038
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,850
Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,437
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,191
Yes. Well, we'll keep the line open.

1041
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,068
All right, Dimitri.

1042
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:48,200
General Turgidson, is there really
a chance for that plane to get through?

1043
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,246
Mr President,
if I may speak freely.

1044
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:56,000
The Russki talks big, but frankly,
we think he's short of know-how.

1045
01:19:56,125 --> 01:20:00,546
You can't expect ignorant peons to
understand a machine like our boys.

1046
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,715
And that's not meant as an insult.

1047
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,384
We all know how much guts
the average Russki's got.

1048
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,887
Look at all of them the Nazis
killed off, they still wouldn't quit!

1049
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,889
Can't you stick to the point?

1050
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:14,727
Well, sir, if the pilot's good,
see--

1051
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:18,939
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1052
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:23,527
You ought to see it. It's a sight!
A big plane, like a '52...

1053
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,613
...its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard!

1054
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,867
-Yeah, but has he got a chance?
-Has he got a chance?

1055
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,410
Hell, ye--

1056
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,270
Navigator to captain.

1057
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:02,900

bomb run check.

1060
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,949
-Take over, Ace.
-Roger.

1061
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,749
-DSO ready.
-Bombardier ready, sir.

01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:18,559
-First safety.
-Release second safety.

1081
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,064
Second safety released.

1082
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,191
Second safety.

1083
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,368
Check bomb door circuits

1084
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:53,051
Bomb door circuits,

1085
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,721
-Switch in backup circuits.

1092
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,545
The Teleflex drive cable
must be sheared away.

1093
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,758
-Fire the explosive bolts!
-Roger.

1094
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,984
Still negative, sir.
The operating circuits are dead, sir.

1095
01:23:56,406 --> 01:24:00,327
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm going
down below and see what I can do.

1096
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,675
Stay on the bomb run, boys.

1097
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,012
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1098
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:15,444

Roger. Three miles.

1119
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:46,493
Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1120
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,393
What about Major Kong?

1121
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:43,216
Mr President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1122
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,344
...to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1123
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,389
It would be quite easy...

1124
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:56,813
...at the bottom of some
of our deeper mineshafts.

1125
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:01,777
The radioactivity would not penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1126
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:06,114
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1127
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,116
...could easily be provided.

1128
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,619
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1129
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,622
Well, let's see now....

1130
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,667
Cobalt thorium G.

1131
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:31,723
Radioactive half-life of....

1132
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:38,563
I would think that....
Possibly 100 years.

1133
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:44,861
You mean people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1134
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,155
It would not be difficult,
mein Fihrer.

1135
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,407
Nuclear reactors could--

1136
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,868
I'm sorry, Mr President.

1137
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,747
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1138
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,667
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1139
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:02,212
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1140
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,339
A quick survey would have
to be made...

1141
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,841
...of the available mine sites
in the country.

1142
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,595
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1143
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,432
...for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1144
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:17,602
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1145
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:20,605
...who stays up
and who goes down.

1146
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:24,568
Well, that would not be necessary,
Mr President.

1147
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,529
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1148
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,906
The computer could
be set and programmed...

1149
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,034
...to accept factors
from youth, health...

1150
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:36,246
...sexual fertility, intelligence...

1151
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,790
...and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1152
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,209
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1153
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:45,255
...that our top government
and military men be included...

1154
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:50,176
...to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1155
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,102
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1156
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:03,064
There would be much time
and little to do.

1157
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:08,486
But with the proper breeding
techniques and a ratio of, say...

1158
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:11,323
...10 females to each male...

1159
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:16,077
...they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1160
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:18,663
...within, say, 20 years.

1161
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:23,501
But look here, doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1162
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:27,005
...be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they'd...

1163
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,592
...well, envy the dead
and not wanna go on living?

1164
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,553
No, sir. Excuse me.

1165
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:46,691
No, sir. When they go down into the
mine, everyone would still be alive.

1166
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,860
There would be
no shocking memories...

1167
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:53,615
...the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1168
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:59,955
...combined with a spirit of bold
curiosity for the adventure ahead!

1169
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,556
Doctor...

1170
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:26,147
...you mentioned the ratio
of 10 women to each man.

1171
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:29,359
Now, wouldn't that necessitate
the abandonment...

1172
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:33,196
...of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1173
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,908
I mean, as far as men
were concerned?

1174
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,368
Regrettably, yes.

1175
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:43,748
But it is, you know, a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1176
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:49,546
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1177
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,382
...service along these lines...

1178
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,428
...the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1179
01:31:56,553 --> 01:32:00,265
...which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1180
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,227
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, doctor.

1181
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,771
Thank you, sir.

1182
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:11,776
I think we ought to look at this from
the military point of view. I mean....

1183
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:16,614
Supposing the Russkies stashed away
some big bombs, see, and we didn't?

1184
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,576
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1185
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,286
I agree, Mr President.

1186
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:25,290
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mineshaft space.

1187
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:29,794
It'd be extremely naive of us to imagine
that these new developments...

1188
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:32,964
...are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1189
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:35,633
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1190
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:38,470
...to prevent them from taking over
mineshaft space...

1191
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,472
...in order to breed more
than we do...

1192
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,725
...thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1193
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:47,896
Mr President, we must not allow
a mineshaft gap!

1194
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:49,814
Sir!

1195
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,442
I have a plan.

1196
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,823
I can walk!
