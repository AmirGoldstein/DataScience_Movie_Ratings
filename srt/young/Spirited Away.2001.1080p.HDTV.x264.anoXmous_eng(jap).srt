1
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:07,599
A Studio Ghibli Film

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,534
<i>2001 Nibariki-TGNDDTM</i>

3
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,773
<i>Good Luck, Chihiro
We'll meet again</i>

4
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:18,313
Chihiro

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:19,779
Chihiro,

6
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,475
we're almost there

7
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:26,290
This really is the
middle of nowhere

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,256
I'll have to shop
in the next town

9
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,795
It'll be great, once
we get used to it

10
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,857
Look, there's the school

11
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,628
That's your new school, Chihiro

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,831
It doesn't look so bad

13
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,672
I liked my old school...

14
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:57,648
Mommy...
My flowers died

15
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,491
No wonder, the way
you clung to them

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,526
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up

17
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:08,224
My very first bouquet is
farewell flowers, how sad

18
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,666
What about that rose
you got for your birthday?

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,964
One rose isn't a bouquet

20
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:16,700
You dropped your card

21
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,274
I'm opening the window

22
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:21,436
C'mon now, behave yourself
It's a big day for all of us

23
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:45,869
SPI RITED AWAY

24
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:01,916
Hey...
Did I take the wrong turn?

25
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,886
I don't get it

26
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,079
That must be it, look

27
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,884
It must be that
blue one over there

28
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:10,723
That's it

29
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,829
I must've missed the turn-off

30
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,032
I bet this road'll get us there

31
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,658
This is always how
you get us lost

32
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,737
Just a little farther, OK?

33
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:22,967
What are those little houses?

34
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:24,734
They're shrines
People pray to them

35
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,307
Daddy, are we lost?

36
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,977
We're fine, we've
got 4-wheel drive

37
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:37,849
Sit down, Chihiro

38
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,303
You're going to kill us!

39
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,345
A tunnel?

40
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,455
What's this strange building?

41
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,723
Must be the entrance

42
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:22,958
Honey...

43
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:25,666
Let's go back, honey

44
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,526
Chihiro

45
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:29,802
No...

46
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,775
It's just plaster

47
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:35,072
This building's pretty new

48
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,319
The wind's going in

49
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:47,991
What is it?

50
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:50,319
Let's have a look
There's a way through

51
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:53,019
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back

52
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,928
No need to be scared

53
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,796
Just a little farther, OK?

54
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,836
The moving van'll
get there before us

55
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:04,133
So, let 'em, they've got the keys
Let the movers move us

56
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,265
I know, but...

57
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,207
No! I won't go!

58
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,507
Daddy, let's go back

59
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:12,843
Nothing to be scared of

60
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,946
I won't go!

61
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,688
Chihiro, you wait in the car

62
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,465
Mommy

63
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,562
Wait

64
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,869
Watch your step

65
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:43,241
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that

66
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,371
Where are we?

67
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,641
Say, do you hear that?

68
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,425
It's a train!

69
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:30,389
Maybe we're near the station

70
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,325
Let's go and find out

71
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,293
What are those houses doing here?

72
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:12,958
I knew it

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,166
This must be an abandoned
theme park

74
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,444
They built so many
in the early '90s,

75
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,013
but they all went down
with the economy

76
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,747
This must be one of 'em

77
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,818
What! No!

78
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:31,511
Let's go back, Daddy

79
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,152
C'mon!

80
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:48,831
Mommy, that building's moaning

81
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:49,938
It's just the wind

82
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,338
What a lovely spot

83
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,943
We should've brought
our lunch with us

84
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,012
They were making a river

85
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,016
Hey, you smell that?

86
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,826
See, it smells great

87
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,019
You're right

88
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,858
Maybe they're still open

89
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,698
Hurry up, Chihiro

90
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,958
Wait for me!

91
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,398
This way

92
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:00,043
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants

93
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:02,237
Where is everybody?

94
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,245
Over there!

95
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,581
Hey, hey!

96
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,291
In here, here

97
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:30,098
How amazing

98
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:33,175
Hello, anybody here?

99
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,677
Come in, Chihiro,
it looks delicious

100
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:37,045
Hello!

101
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:45,610
Oh, don't worry
We can pay them when they get back

102
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,280
You're right
That one looks great...

103
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,653
I wonder what this is called

104
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:55,060
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it

105
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,928
I don't want to!

106
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,662
Let's go!
They're gonna be mad at us

107
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:03,265
Don't worry,
you've got Daddy here

108
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,466
I've got credit cards and cash

109
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,243
Take some, Chihiro,
it's so tender

110
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:14,951
Mustard

111
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:15,814
Thank you

112
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:29,257
Mommy!
Daddy!

113
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,092
Weird...

114
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,691
There's a train!

115
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,109
You're not allowed here
Go back!

116
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,106
Wha...?

117
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,115
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark

118
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,980
They're lighting the lamps
Go!

119
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,614
I'll distract them
Get back across the river!

120
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,998
What's his problem?

121
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:01,677
Daddy!

122
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,446
Daddy, let's go home

123
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,146
Let's go, Daddy!

124
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:36,018
Daddy!
Mommy!

125
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,530
Mommy!

126
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:10,886
It's water!

127
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,329
This can't be...

128
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,164
I'm dreaming, dreaming!

129
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,969
Wake up! Wake up!

130
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,073
Wake... up...

131
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,783
It's just a dream, a dream

132
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,911
Go away, disappear

133
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,688
Disappear

134
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,198
I can see through!

135
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:02,434
It's a dream, it's got to be

136
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,383
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend

137
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,553
No, no, no!

138
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,620
Open your mouth and eat this

139
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,896
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll vanish

140
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,127
No!

141
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:13,538
Don't worry
It won't turn you into a pig

142
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,304
Chew it and swallow

143
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,646
Good girl, you're fine

144
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,156
See for yourself

145
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,660
I'm back again...

146
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,929
You see?
Now come

147
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:45,105
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

148
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,941
You can't see them now,
but you will

149
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,107
Quiet!

150
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,800
It's looking for you

151
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,960
There's no time, let's run!

152
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:17,364
I... I can't stand! Oh, no!

153
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:18,899
My legs don't work

154
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,477
Calm, now
Take a deep breath

155
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:29,175
In the name of the wind and
the water within thee... Unbind her

156
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:30,519
Get up!

157
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,898
Hold your breath while
we're on the bridge

158
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,258
Even a tiny breath,

159
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,361
will break the spell and
the attendants will see you

160
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:28,939
I'm scared

161
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,444
Be calm

162
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,772
Welcome
Always nice to see you

163
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,942
Welcome, welcome

164
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:37,645
I'm back from my task

165
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,448
Welcome back, sir

166
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,553
A deep breath...

167
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:44,785
And hold...

168
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:05,406
Welcome back!
We missed you!

169
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,445
Hang on, we're almost...

170
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,953
Master Haku!

171
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,413
Where have you...

172
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:16,585
Wha...
A human?

173
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,754
Run!

174
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,320
What...

175
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,677
Master Haku, Master Haku!

176
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,443
Chase after it
A human intruder!

177
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,780
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

178
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:43,748
They know you're here

179
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,684
I'm sorry, I took a breath

180
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,780
No, Chihiro, you did very well

181
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,785
Listen and I'll
tell you what to do

182
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:52,293
Stay here, and they'll find you

183
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,362
I'll distract them
In the meantime, you escape

184
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,798
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please

185
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:02,628
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here

186
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,297
And save your parents, too

187
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,204
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

188
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,642
Be still...

189
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:14,046
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate

190
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,914
Take the stairs, all the way down

191
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,717
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires

192
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,349
Kamaji's there, so look for him

193
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:25,722
Kamaji?

194
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:29,554
Ask him for work

195
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,997
Even if he refuses, insist

196
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,995
If you don't work, Yubaba will
turn you into an animal

197
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:36,903
Yubaba?

198
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,497
You'll see
She's the sorceress who rules our world

199
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:43,308
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

200
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:44,744
but keep on asking him for work

201
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,739
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance

202
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,842
Then even Yubaba can't harm you

203
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:50,749
OK

204
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,753
Master Haku, Master Haku!

205
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,350
I have to go

206
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,018
Remember, Chihiro
I'm your friend

207
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,525
How do you know my name?

208
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,027
I've known you
since you were small

209
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,866
My name is Haku

210
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,101
Here I am!

211
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,270
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you

212
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:16,445
I know
It's about my task

213
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:26,458
Um...

214
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,990
Excuse me

215
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,472
Um...

216
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,978
Um, are you Kamaji?

217
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:57,318
Um, Haku sent me here
Please let me work here

218
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:05,232
Darn, all at once...

219
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:08,029
Get to work, you little runts

220
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,900
I'm... Kamaji

221
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,772
Slave to the boilers
that heat the baths

222
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:17,175
Step on it, boys!

223
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,048
Um, please let me work here!

224
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:24,583
I've got all the help I need
The place is full of soot

225
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,520
Plenty of replacements

226
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:44,038
Oh, I'm sorry

227
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,769
Please wait

228
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,091
Outta the way!

229
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,442
Um...
What should I do with this?

230
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:06,677
Do I just leave it?

231
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:09,180
Finish what you start!

232
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,156
It's hot

233
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:12,919
Hey, you runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

234
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:16,685
And you, watch it
You can't just take someone's job

235
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,192
If they don't work,
the spell wears off

236
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:23,389
Got no work for you here
Look elsewhere

237
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,203
You sootballs got a problem?!

238
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:36,608
Get to work! To work!

239
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:39,704
Chow time

240
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:42,113
What? You guys at it again?

241
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,884
Cut it out
Where's your bowl?

242
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,017
I keep telling you
to leave it out

243
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:52,560
Meal time!
Take a break!

244
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:10,405
A human! You're in trouble!

245
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,981
They're having a fit
about it upstairs

246
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,747
That's my granddaughter

247
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:17,250
Granddaughter!?

248
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:21,920
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need

249
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:25,585
Would you take her to Yubaba?

250
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:27,319
The girl can handle her, I'm sure

251
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,090
Not a chance!
And risk my life!?

252
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,235
Take this, then
A roasted newt

253
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,269
Real quality

254
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:41,042
If you want to work, you'll have
to make a deal with Yubaba

255
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:43,270
Might as well try your luck

256
00:29:44,513 --> 00:29:47,277
Fine!
You there, follow me

257
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,385
Can't you even manage a
"Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

258
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:57,720
Yes... yes ma'am

259
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:59,419
You sure are slow
Hurry!

260
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:00,620
Yes ma'am

261
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:06,024
What do you need shoes for!
Or socks!

262
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:06,999
Yes ma'am!

263
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,905
Did you even thank Kamaji?

264
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,807
He's looking out for you

265
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:20,712
Thank you very much, sir

266
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,546
Good luck

267
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:36,398
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back

268
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:53,244
Get over here!

269
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,417
You wanna lose your nose?

270
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:25,469
We're almost there

271
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,639
Right

272
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,142
Here we are

273
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:36,920
Wel... welcome!

274
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:47,458
This elevator is not in service, sir
Please use another

275
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,057
He's following us...

276
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,787
Quit gawking

277
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,344
Here we are

278
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,351
Your room is on the right

279
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:41,052
Lin?

280
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:42,646
Yes!

281
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,993
What's that smell?

282
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:48,827
It's human
You reek of human

283
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:49,556
Is that so?

284
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,664
I smell it, I do
Smells mighty tasty, too

285
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:56,670
You're hiding something

286
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,173
Tell me the truth, now

287
00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:00,332
This smell?

288
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,171
Roasted...
Gimme!

289
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:06,506
Not a chance
It's for the other girls

290
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:09,841
I'm begging you
I'll settle for a leg!

291
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,752
Anyone going up,
pull down on the lever

292
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,125
Not going to knock?!

293
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,828
What a puny little girl

294
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:17,140
Come closer...

295
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,480
I said closer

296
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,327
Oww...

297
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:52,408
You're making a racket
Keep it down

298
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,567
Um...

299
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,069
Please let me work here

300
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:26,915
Stop babbling

301
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:30,041
You're just a useless weakling

302
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:34,752
Besides, this is
no place for humans

303
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:38,325
It's a bath house,

304
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:42,420
where 8 million gods can
rest their weary bones

305
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:46,398
Your parents had some nerve!

306
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,937
Gobbling our guests'
food like pigs!

307
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:52,265
Just desserts, I'd say

308
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:55,743
And you'll never see...

309
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:58,243
your world again either

310
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:04,615
You'd make a lovely piglet

311
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,749
Or maybe a lump of coal

312
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:17,256
I see you're trembling

313
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:21,097
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far

314
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,262
Someone must've helped you

315
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:26,764
I must thank your friend

316
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:31,335
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me

317
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:35,949
Please let me work here!

318
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:37,617
Not that again!

319
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:39,117
I want to work here!

320
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:44,490
Shut Up!

321
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,964
Why should I hire you?

322
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:56,401
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, crybaby

323
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,939
Stupid to boot

324
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,532
I've nothing for you

325
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:03,634
Forget it

326
00:38:03,745 --> 00:38:07,408
I've got all the bums
I need around here

327
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:12,715
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

328
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:14,880
nastiest job I've got,

329
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,893
until you breathe
your very last breath?!

330
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:35,566
Stop that!
What's wrong...

331
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:39,206
I'll be right there
That's a good baby, now

332
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:42,081
What? You still here!
Get out!

333
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,178
I want to work here!

334
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:46,713
Don't shout

335
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:51,923
I'll be right there...

336
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:55,185
That's a good baby,
there, there

337
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:57,531
Please let me work!

338
00:38:57,766 --> 00:39:00,564
OK, OK, just pipe down

339
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:05,532
There, there, now

340
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,289
Your contract

341
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:30,287
Sign your name

342
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:32,433
I'll put you to work

343
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:36,070
But one peep out of you
about anything,

344
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,469
and I'll turn you
right into a piglet!

345
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,569
Um, I sign my name here?

346
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:44,975
That's right
Quit dilly-dallying and do it

347
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,778
Unbelievable

348
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,118
That ridiculous oath I took

349
00:39:56,658 --> 00:40:00,116
To give work to whoever asks

350
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:03,156
Signed it?

351
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:04,254
Yes

352
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:10,602
You're Chihiro, huh?

353
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:11,261
Yes

354
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:14,301
What an extravagant name

355
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:26,447
From now on, you'll be Sen

356
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:28,819
You got that? You're Sen

357
00:40:28,957 --> 00:40:31,517
Answer me, Sen!

358
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,122
Yes...

359
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:34,694
Did you call?

360
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:41,032
This child's starting work as of now
Look after her

361
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:41,795
Yes

362
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:43,671
Your name?

363
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:44,770
What?

364
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:47,467
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen

365
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,003
Follow me, then, Sen

366
00:40:58,553 --> 00:40:59,713
Haku... Um...

367
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:01,883
No idle chatter

368
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,550
Call me Master Haku

369
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:23,341
Even on Yubaba's orders...

370
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:24,877
We can't allow humans

371
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,070
Her contract's signed

372
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:27,841
What...?

373
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,246
Thank you, everyone

374
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:33,017
Don't send her to us
Can't bear that human stink

375
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:36,857
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish

376
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,122
If she's still useless then, fry her,
boil her, do with her as you will

377
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,024
Back to work!
Where's Lin?

378
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:47,526
Don't dump her on me!

379
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:49,534
You wanted help

380
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:52,639
That's right, Lin's just perfect

381
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:54,033
Go, Sen

382
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,609
Yes sir

383
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:59,107
What a pain
You're gonna pay for this

384
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:01,248
Off you go!

385
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,047
C'mon

386
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:15,260
So you pulled it off, huh?!

387
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:18,055
You're so thick,
I was worried

388
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:22,230
Keep your wits, now
If you need something, ask me, OK?

389
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,572
What's wrong

390
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:28,575
I'm dizzy

391
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:35,241
So this is our room

392
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,616
Chow, then bed,
you'll be fine

393
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,750
You wash your own apron!
Trousers!

394
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:47,755
You're so puny

395
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,920
Too big...

396
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,592
Um, Lin...

397
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:54,691
What?

398
00:42:54,803 --> 00:42:56,771
Are there two Hakus here?

399
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:58,332
Two?!

400
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,965
Of him? I sure hope not

401
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,143
Still too big

402
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,939
He's Yubaba's henchman
Watch out for him

403
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,611
Where the...

404
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,480
Here it is

405
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:18,952
What's wrong?
Are you OK?

406
00:43:19,861 --> 00:43:22,295
What's all the fuss, Lin?

407
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:24,865
New girl
Says she feels faint

408
00:44:56,691 --> 00:45:01,151
Meet me at the bridge
I'll show you your mother and father

409
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,138
My shoes...

410
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:02,146
Thank you

411
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:12,125
Follow me

412
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:57,694
Daddy, Mommy, it's me!

413
00:47:58,373 --> 00:47:59,431
It's Sen

414
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:02,874
Mommy, Daddy!

415
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,745
Are they sick or hurt?

416
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:10,443
No, they ate too much
Sleeping it off

417
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:14,219
They don't even remember
being human

418
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,488
Daddy, Mommy,
I promise I'll save you!

419
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:25,691
Don't get too fat,
or they'll eat you!

420
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:35,705
Hide these

421
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:39,573
I thought they were gone

422
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:42,045
You'll need them to get home

423
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:50,656
This was a farewell card...

424
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,325
Chi-hi-ro

425
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:56,989
Chihiro...
That's my name

426
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,329
Yubaba rules others by
stealing their names

427
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:05,331
You're Sen here, but keep your
real name a secret

428
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,576
She almost got mine
I'd nearly turned into Sen

429
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:12,910
If she steals your name, you'll
never find your way home

430
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:16,079
I no longer remember mine

431
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:18,078
Your real name?

432
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:21,911
But it's strange
I remembered yours

433
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:26,988
Go ahead, eat,
you must be hungry

434
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,687
I don't want to

435
00:49:28,796 --> 00:49:32,755
I put a spell on it to give you
back your strength, eat it

436
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:11,995
You've had a hard time
Eat some more

437
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:28,253
Can you find your way back?

438
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:30,950
Yes, Haku, thank you
I'll work very hard

439
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:32,321
Good

440
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,388
Where were you?
I was worried

441
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:09,581
I'm sorry

442
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,763
Outta my way

443
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,045
That the best you can do?

444
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,884
You and Sen get
the big tub as of today

445
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,288
What! But that's Frog work!

446
00:52:41,455 --> 00:52:44,390
Orders from the top
Better give it your all

447
00:53:04,645 --> 00:53:06,408
Aren't you... getting wet?

448
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,277
Hurry up, Sen!

449
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:13,717
Coming!

450
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:15,812
I'll leave this open

451
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:44,575
On the big tub, Lin?

452
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:45,344
Lay off me

453
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:52,216
Jerks!
They haven't scrubbed this in ages!

454
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:10,040
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests

455
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:11,644
It's caked with sludge

456
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,377
Lin, Sen, first customers are here

457
00:54:14,749 --> 00:54:16,376
Right away...

458
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,677
Shoot, clearly harassment

459
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:21,880
This tub needs an herbal soak
Get a tag from the foreman

460
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:23,045
A tag?

461
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:27,895
An herbal soak tag

462
00:54:28,062 --> 00:54:29,324
Right

463
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:31,989
What's a foreman, Lin?

464
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:39,072
Something's coming
I wonder what

465
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:51,915
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

466
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:18,839
I can't waste that on you!

467
00:55:18,946 --> 00:55:20,777
Why good morning!

468
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,946
Feeling refreshed?

469
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:24,610
For Kasuga sama

470
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:26,980
One deluxe sulfur soak

471
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:29,622
No point in standing there
Back to work!

472
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:31,920
Scrub with your hands

473
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:33,687
Good morning

474
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:34,624
Your hands, I say

475
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:38,128
But... Um...
It has to be an herbal soak

476
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:39,924
You sure are dense

477
00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:44,130
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up
Relax and enjoy...

478
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:55,975
Hello, foreman here
Yes, ma'am...

479
00:55:58,185 --> 00:55:59,209
Thank you so much!

480
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,480
That's not...

481
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:02,019
Hey, you, wait!

482
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:03,145
What's the trouble?

483
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:04,485
Why, nothing at all...

484
00:56:04,992 --> 00:56:06,550
We have an intruder

485
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,592
Is it human?

486
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:10,493
You figure it out
Haku's out today

487
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:13,299
Wow, you got a really good one

488
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,835
This goes to Kamaji

489
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,165
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now

490
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:28,281
Yank on this for hot water

491
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:39,322
You're such a klutz

492
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:41,520
Look at that color

493
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:43,790
That's the dried worm salts

494
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:47,467
With water this murky
who's gonna see the sludge

495
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:52,368
Yank it again when it's full
It'll stop

496
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:54,500
Go ahead, let go

497
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:56,200
I'll get our breakfast

498
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,538
Sure!

499
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,562
Ouch!

500
00:57:26,073 --> 00:57:28,667
Um...
The bath's not ready yet

501
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:35,578
But, there are so many...

502
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:40,249
Wha...
They're for me?

503
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:45,854
But...
I don't need this many

504
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:50,354
No, just one

505
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:06,438
Madam!

506
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:07,878
It's a Stink God?!

507
00:58:07,982 --> 00:58:10,075
An Extra Large Stinker at that

508
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:11,811
Headed straight for the bridge

509
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:14,317
Please turn back

510
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:18,319
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night

511
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:21,160
Please withdraw, please!

512
00:58:21,328 --> 00:58:23,853
Peeeee-ewy...

513
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:28,062
Something's fishy
Didn't seem like a Stink God, to me...

514
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:30,603
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

515
00:58:31,405 --> 00:58:34,897
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can

516
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:38,036
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry!

517
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:39,110
Please hurry!

518
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:43,316
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling

519
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:44,111
Yes sir!

520
00:58:44,518 --> 00:58:47,078
Listen, this is your first job

521
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:49,850
You take this customer
in the big tub

522
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:50,849
Um... um...

523
00:58:51,025 --> 00:58:52,856
One peep out of you
and you're coal!

524
00:58:53,227 --> 00:58:53,955
Got that?

525
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,028
It has arrived

526
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,405
Don't insult the customer!

527
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:20,315
Welggum to our bazzs...

528
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:25,392
Oh...
Money!

529
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:28,119
Sen, hurry, take it!

530
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:29,787
Yes ma'am

531
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:42,367
Zhow him de bazz

532
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:44,239
PI... Pleazze

533
01:00:02,796 --> 01:00:04,593
Sen!

534
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:11,170
Awful...

535
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:13,136
Our food...

536
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,365
Open the windows!
All of 'em!

537
01:00:58,686 --> 01:01:01,587
What?
Just a minute

538
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:08,120
Truly filthy, no?

539
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:09,752
This is no laughing matter

540
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:11,330
Let's see what she does

541
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:18,630
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub

542
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:22,573
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands!

543
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:36,519
Did you give Sen new tags?

544
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,386
Never, what a waste!

545
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:23,100
Oh no!
All that precious herbal formula!

546
01:02:49,296 --> 01:02:51,093
Sen! Sen, where are you!

547
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:52,663
Lin!

548
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:53,926
You OK?

549
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:56,594
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

550
01:02:57,271 --> 01:02:59,262
He's sending the best
herbal soak ever!

551
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:03,004
Thank you
He's got a thorn stuck in him

552
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,099
A thorn!?

553
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:05,769
It's in so deep, it won't come out!

554
01:03:06,113 --> 01:03:08,638
Thorn!?
She said thorn!

555
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,850
Rally the help downstairs!

556
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:12,611
Step on it!

557
01:03:16,323 --> 01:03:17,790
Sen and Lin!

558
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,290
that's no Stink God in there!

559
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:23,963
Grab this rope!

560
01:03:24,131 --> 01:03:25,189
Yes ma'am!

561
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:35,474
Hold on tight!

562
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:36,574
Yes ma'am!

563
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:40,638
Hustle now, and get
the women to help them

564
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:42,640
I tied it!

565
01:03:43,817 --> 01:03:47,309
Everyone, all of you!
All together now!

566
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:50,151
Heave!

567
01:03:50,858 --> 01:03:52,655
And heave!

568
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:55,154
And heave!

569
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:57,490
And heave!

570
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:06,169
A bicycle?

571
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:08,000
As I suspected!
Now, pull!

572
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:10,166
Now, heave!

573
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,945
And heave!

574
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:47,069
Sen, you OK!?

575
01:04:57,558 --> 01:05:00,755
Well done...

576
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:31,523
Gold! Gold!
It's gold!

577
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:34,416
Hands off!
That's company property!

578
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:38,029
Be still
Our guest is still with us

579
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:46,940
Sen, you're in our guest's way
Get out and open the door

580
01:05:47,107 --> 01:05:49,473
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

581
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:20,397
Sen! You did great!
You made us a bundle!

582
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:23,768
That River God's famous

583
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:25,469
You can all learn from Sen

584
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:28,341
Sake's on the house, tonight!

585
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:31,516
Now! Time to hand over all
that gold you picked up!

586
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,899
Want some?
I swiped it

587
01:06:47,434 --> 01:06:48,833
Thank you

588
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:51,095
Man, oh, man

589
01:06:53,707 --> 01:06:55,174
I didn't see Haku

590
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:57,003
Not Haku again

591
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:00,445
He just disappears sometimes

592
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:04,544
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff

593
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:05,514
Really...

594
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:07,085
Lights out, Lin

595
01:07:07,187 --> 01:07:08,415
Right

596
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:36,041
There's a town
Looks like the ocean...

597
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:39,147
What did you expect
after all that rain

598
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:45,047
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town
I'm gonna get out of here

599
01:08:08,615 --> 01:08:10,845
What's wrong!

600
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,947
Gold!

601
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:47,912
Who are you?
You're no customer

602
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,613
You're not allowed in there!

603
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:59,389
Hey! It's gold, gold!
It's for me!?

604
01:09:04,805 --> 01:09:07,069
You can make gold?

605
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:13,509
Gimme!

606
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:23,486
Who goes there?

607
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:26,921
It's way past bedtime

608
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,693
Hey boss, I'm hungry

609
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,094
Starving

610
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:36,066
That voice...

611
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:38,000
There, I'll pay you now

612
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,433
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

613
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:43,099
Wake everyone up!

614
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:52,014
Mommy, Daddy, the River God
gave me this cake

615
01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:55,120
I'm sure if you eat it,
you'll turn back into people

616
01:09:59,192 --> 01:10:01,217
Dad, Mom, where are you?

617
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:02,687
Daddy!

618
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:14,965
Bad dream

619
01:10:16,576 --> 01:10:18,043
Lin...?

620
01:10:21,915 --> 01:10:23,542
Where is everybody?

621
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,820
Wow... it really did
turn into an ocean!

622
01:10:38,231 --> 01:10:41,098
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here

623
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:47,032
Kamaji's already lit the fires?

624
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,233
Did I sleep that long?

625
01:10:52,946 --> 01:10:55,414
The customer's waiting
Hurry it up!

626
01:10:55,682 --> 01:10:59,584
Serve everything you've
got, even leftovers!

627
01:11:01,621 --> 01:11:02,553
Sen!

628
01:11:02,656 --> 01:11:03,782
Lin

629
01:11:03,924 --> 01:11:06,518
I was just going to wake you up
Look!

630
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:09,020
Real gold
He gave it to me

631
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:11,521
This guest's a real high roller

632
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:13,995
Please, sir, try this!

633
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,500
Taste the very best!

634
01:11:18,138 --> 01:11:20,629
Throw us some gold!

635
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:22,600
Your blessings!

636
01:11:22,776 --> 01:11:26,041
I'm starving, bring it all!

637
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,112
Please sir!

638
01:11:30,784 --> 01:11:31,944
That guest...

639
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,720
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep
Now's your chance

640
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:37,953
I'm going to see Kamaji

641
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,786
I wouldn't go right now

642
01:11:40,894 --> 01:11:43,385
He's in a foul mood
'cause they woke him up

643
01:11:43,496 --> 01:11:45,293
Let's go back for more, Lin

644
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:13,758
What if I don't recognize
my parents?

645
01:12:14,494 --> 01:12:17,258
I hope Dad hasn't
gotten too fat

646
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:46,890
The dragon I saw before

647
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,187
It's coming this way!

648
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:52,959
What are they?
Not birds

649
01:13:04,444 --> 01:13:07,470
Fight back, Haku!
This way

650
01:13:07,647 --> 01:13:08,443
Haku!

651
01:13:09,115 --> 01:13:10,207
Haku!

652
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:30,733
Oh...
It's just paper...

653
01:13:59,099 --> 01:14:01,192
Haku?
That is you, right?

654
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,739
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone

655
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:12,106
You're safe, now

656
01:14:25,325 --> 01:14:26,952
He's going to Yubaba...

657
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,992
Oh, no!
He'll die!

658
01:14:38,004 --> 01:14:42,407
<i>The very richest man
in the whole wide world</i>

659
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:46,575
<i>That man himself,
is now approaching</i>

660
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:49,973
Welcome!

661
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,415
<i>Time to beg for tips
Start begging</i>

662
01:14:52,519 --> 01:14:55,420
Please, sir! Over here!

663
01:14:55,588 --> 01:14:58,318
Now beg

664
01:14:58,424 --> 01:15:00,085
Now beg

665
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,091
Gold springs from his palms

666
01:15:02,929 --> 01:15:06,194
Toss some this way, sir!

667
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:11,569
Hey, what are you doing?

668
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:12,660
I'm going upstairs

669
01:15:12,772 --> 01:15:14,763
No, you don't
What's this!

670
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:16,601
It's blood!

671
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:22,842
Move, move
Let our guest through

672
01:15:24,484 --> 01:15:26,384
Thank you for helping me before

673
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:29,053
Don't just stand there...

674
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,568
I don't want any
Don't need any

675
01:15:55,648 --> 01:15:58,173
I'm busy, please excuse me

676
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:12,326
Quiet! Quiet down!

677
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,758
Back, get back!

678
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:17,192
Please forgive her manners

679
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:21,032
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

680
01:16:23,376 --> 01:16:25,173
Wipe that smile off your face

681
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:26,141
I saw that look

682
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:27,713
Why, I would never...

683
01:16:32,685 --> 01:16:34,949
<i>He ate them!</i>

684
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:03,441
Yubaba?

685
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:18,949
We're in a fine mess, now

686
01:19:19,352 --> 01:19:21,479
Actually, he's a No Face

687
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:23,384
That's right, a No Face!

688
01:19:23,856 --> 01:19:26,620
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right

689
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:30,457
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there

690
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:33,497
Look, the carpet's a mess

691
01:19:33,599 --> 01:19:35,863
Get Haku out of here

692
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:37,697
He's no use to me now

693
01:20:00,326 --> 01:20:03,261
Sleeping outside of
your crib again?

694
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:11,565
Oh, I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby

695
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:14,501
Baba still has work to do

696
01:20:17,477 --> 01:20:20,241
Go back to sleep now
Good baby

697
01:20:48,641 --> 01:20:50,370
Ouch, let go!

698
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:52,508
Oh, thank you for helping me

699
01:20:52,612 --> 01:20:55,945
But I'm in a hurry
Please let me go

700
01:20:56,048 --> 01:20:58,608
You came here to make me sick

701
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:01,385
Bad germs outside, bad

702
01:21:02,388 --> 01:21:06,119
I'm a human
Maybe you never saw one before

703
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:08,790
You'll get sick out there

704
01:21:08,961 --> 01:21:10,895
Stay here and play with me

705
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:12,755
Are you sick?

706
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:15,698
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside

707
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:18,292
It's staying in here that'll
make you sick!

708
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:22,135
You see, somebody I really
care about got hurt very badly

709
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:23,935
So I've got to go right now

710
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:25,305
Please let go of my arm!

711
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:27,272
If you go, I'll start crying

712
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,816
If I cry, Baba will come
and kill you

713
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:32,610
I'll break your little arm

714
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:33,912
That hurts!

715
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,420
Please, I'll come
play with you later

716
01:21:36,689 --> 01:21:38,156
No, I wanna play now!

717
01:21:42,328 --> 01:21:44,421
That's blood! Get it!
It's blood!

718
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,703
Haku!

719
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,003
Stop, go away!
Scat, scat!

720
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:01,044
Haku! It is you, right?!

721
01:22:01,247 --> 01:22:02,714
Hang on!

722
01:22:03,182 --> 01:22:05,343
Be quiet!
Haku!

723
01:22:11,057 --> 01:22:12,024
Shoo, shoo, go away

724
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:16,122
Oh, no!

725
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,006
I'm not afraid of blood

726
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:34,875
I'll cry if you don't play

727
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:36,878
Please be a good boy and wait

728
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:40,385
If you don't play with me,
I'll cry...

729
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:43,820
Please, wait!

730
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:47,119
What a racket
Simmer down

731
01:22:48,561 --> 01:22:51,325
You're a little butterball,
aren't you?

732
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:01,035
Guess I'm still a little transparent

733
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:01,902
Baba

734
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:06,669
Oh, dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

735
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,821
There, that gives you
a little more freedom

736
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:18,582
Let's see now...

737
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:20,922
What shall we turn you into?

738
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:41,773
This is our little secret
You tell anyone,

739
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:43,812
a: I'll rip your mouth out

740
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:46,610
Who are you?

741
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:49,253
Yubaba's twin sister

742
01:23:49,355 --> 01:23:53,348
Thanks to you, I've had a good
look at this place, enjoyed myself

743
01:23:53,459 --> 01:23:55,120
Now hand over the dragon

744
01:23:55,394 --> 01:23:57,726
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt

745
01:23:58,164 --> 01:24:01,133
That dragon's a thief,
my sister's lackey

746
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,326
Stole a precious seal
from my house

747
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:07,233
Haku would never!
He's so kind

748
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,401
All dragons are kind
Kind and stupid

749
01:24:11,544 --> 01:24:15,981
Eager to learn my sister's
magical ways

750
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:20,281
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants

751
01:24:20,386 --> 01:24:22,479
Move away

752
01:24:22,588 --> 01:24:25,056
It's too late for him anyway

753
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:28,319
The seal was protected
by a charm...

754
01:24:28,494 --> 01:24:30,485
Any who try to steal it must die

755
01:24:31,263 --> 01:24:32,992
No, you can't!

756
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:42,564
What's gotten into them?

757
01:24:42,675 --> 01:24:45,269
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room

758
01:24:53,185 --> 01:24:55,380
Oh, dear, seems I was careless

759
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:56,879
Haku!
Oh, no!

760
01:25:18,377 --> 01:25:19,401
Haku!

761
01:25:47,573 --> 01:25:49,200
What on earth is this!

762
01:25:49,308 --> 01:25:50,673
Hey!
Just wait

763
01:25:53,746 --> 01:25:54,906
Haku!

764
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,008
Does it hurt?

765
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:05,748
This is serious

766
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:09,090
Haku, don't give up!

767
01:26:09,195 --> 01:26:10,856
Oh, no, he's going to die!

768
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,227
There's something inside him
that's killing him

769
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,493
Inside him!?

770
01:26:15,601 --> 01:26:18,764
It's a good spell
Nothing I can do

771
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,437
Haku, the River God
gave me this

772
01:26:22,608 --> 01:26:24,633
Eat it, maybe it'll help

773
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:29,106
Haku, open your mouth!

774
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:32,041
Please, Haku, eat it!

775
01:26:33,819 --> 01:26:35,480
See, it's safe

776
01:26:35,955 --> 01:26:37,889
Is it an herbal cake?

777
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:41,225
Open
That's a good boy...

778
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,825
That's it

779
01:26:46,966 --> 01:26:48,365
Swallow!

780
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:08,013
He spit it out!
That's it!

781
01:27:20,866 --> 01:27:21,992
The seal!

782
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:23,998
It got away!
There! Over there!

783
01:27:43,856 --> 01:27:46,347
Gross, gross, Sen!
Totally gross

784
01:27:50,696 --> 01:27:51,594
Clean!

785
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:54,359
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister, Kamaji

786
01:27:54,867 --> 01:27:57,392
From Zeniba?
A witch's seal!

787
01:27:57,937 --> 01:28:00,098
Precious loot, I'd say

788
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:04,541
Oh...
I knew it was Haku!

789
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:06,234
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

790
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,469
Haku!

791
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:10,980
Haku! Haku!

792
01:28:13,419 --> 01:28:15,387
Kamaji! He's not breathing

793
01:28:15,554 --> 01:28:18,990
Yes he is, but he's still
gravely ill from the spell...

794
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,335
That should calm him some

795
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:38,709
Haku turned up one day here,
just like you

796
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:41,803
Said he wanted to learn magic

797
01:28:41,914 --> 01:28:43,905
I didn't approve...

798
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,414
becoming a sorcerer's apprentice...

799
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:47,678
a: I warned him,

800
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,588
but he wouldn't listen

801
01:28:50,923 --> 01:28:52,550
Said he had nowhere left to go

802
01:28:52,658 --> 01:28:56,150
Signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice

803
01:28:56,695 --> 01:28:59,755
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

804
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:02,799
and his eyes took on
a sharp gleam

805
01:29:05,104 --> 01:29:08,767
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Yubaba's sister

806
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:12,740
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku

807
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:14,608
Tell me where she lives

808
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,445
Go to Zeniba's?

809
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,850
She's one scary sorceress

810
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:20,611
Please

811
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:23,216
Haku helped me

812
01:29:23,355 --> 01:29:24,879
Now I want to help him

813
01:29:26,558 --> 01:29:29,891
You can get there all right...

814
01:29:29,995 --> 01:29:31,895
But getting back...

815
01:29:32,297 --> 01:29:33,992
Wait here

816
01:29:36,468 --> 01:29:39,665
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

817
01:29:40,472 --> 01:29:43,407
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please

818
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,819
Sen! I hunted for you
everywhere!

819
01:29:57,489 --> 01:29:58,547
Lin

820
01:29:58,657 --> 01:30:01,319
That's Haku
What happened here...

821
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:02,925
Who are these guys?

822
01:30:04,163 --> 01:30:06,324
My new friends

823
01:30:06,665 --> 01:30:09,930
Yubaba's tearing the place
apart looking for you

824
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:13,527
The big tipper turned out to
be a horrible monster, No Face

825
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:16,767
<i>Yubaba says you led him here</i>

826
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:21,103
Maybe I did

827
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,441
You serious?!

828
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:25,346
I just thought
he was a customer...

829
01:30:25,517 --> 01:30:28,350
He's already swallowed
two Frogs and a Slug!

830
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:31,856
Found it!
Here it is, Sen!

831
01:30:32,357 --> 01:30:33,984
We're busy, gramps

832
01:30:34,093 --> 01:30:36,061
You can use this

833
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:39,860
That's a train ticket
Where'd you get that?

834
01:30:40,032 --> 01:30:42,466
I've had it for 40 years

835
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:46,196
Now listen, it's the 6th stop,
called Swamp Bottom

836
01:30:46,572 --> 01:30:47,698
Swamp Bottom?

837
01:30:47,806 --> 01:30:49,706
That's right, it's the 6th stop

838
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:50,739
The 6th stop

839
01:30:51,043 --> 01:30:54,843
Make sure you get it right
There used to be a return train,

840
01:30:54,947 --> 01:30:56,881
but these days
it's a one-way ride

841
01:30:56,982 --> 01:30:58,472
Still interested?

842
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:02,084
Yup
I'll walk back, along the tracks

843
01:31:03,655 --> 01:31:05,384
But what about Yubaba?

844
01:31:05,557 --> 01:31:07,047
I'll go to her now

845
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:11,256
I promise I'll be back, Haku
You can't die

846
01:31:12,064 --> 01:31:13,929
What's going on here?

847
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:16,598
Don't you see?
It's called... Love...

848
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:27,010
It just keeps getting bigger!

849
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:28,704
Don't let it swallow me!

850
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:29,610
Here she comes!

851
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:38,722
Thank goodness, Sen!

852
01:31:38,857 --> 01:31:41,325
Yubaba can't control him

853
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:48,062
There's no need to get upset
I'm sure Sen will turn up

854
01:31:48,534 --> 01:31:50,968
Where's Sen! I want Sen!

855
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:52,963
Go, hurry

856
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:00,277
Yubaba, it's Sen

857
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:01,869
Where were you!

858
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:06,314
Sen has come, dear guest
We'll be right with you

859
01:32:07,352 --> 01:32:10,446
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster!

860
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:13,320
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him

861
01:32:17,362 --> 01:32:19,660
What's that filthy rat?!

862
01:32:21,533 --> 01:32:23,831
Don't you recognize him?

863
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:26,865
Of course not,
how disgusting!

864
01:32:27,105 --> 01:32:28,402
Now, in you go

865
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:32,203
Call if you need us

866
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,578
Is she all right
in there by herself?

867
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:37,512
Want to take her place?

868
01:32:58,036 --> 01:33:01,130
Try this, it's yummy

869
01:33:03,075 --> 01:33:07,478
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else

870
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,346
Come over here, Sen

871
01:33:13,452 --> 01:33:16,979
What is it you want?
You can tell me

872
01:33:17,422 --> 01:33:19,356
Where did you come from?

873
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,722
There's someplace
I have to go right away

874
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:26,697
You should go back
where you came from

875
01:33:26,798 --> 01:33:29,733
You can't help me
with what I want

876
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:34,604
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

877
01:33:35,574 --> 01:33:38,737
I don't wanna...
Don't wanna...

878
01:33:39,811 --> 01:33:43,577
I'm lonely, lonely...

879
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:45,781
Can't you get back home?

880
01:33:46,285 --> 01:33:49,777
I want Sen, want Sen

881
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:51,444
Take the gold

882
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:53,250
Are you going to eat me?

883
01:33:53,425 --> 01:33:54,221
Take it!

884
01:33:54,326 --> 01:33:55,122
Take it!

885
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:07,097
If you're going to eat me,
have this first

886
01:34:07,806 --> 01:34:11,765
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it

887
01:34:32,664 --> 01:34:33,961
Sen!

888
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:40,733
Girl!
What did you feed me?!

889
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,748
Out of my way!

890
01:34:58,023 --> 01:34:59,991
Not on my premises!

891
01:35:13,271 --> 01:35:14,670
Over here

892
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:16,769
Here!

893
01:36:01,586 --> 01:36:03,213
You'll pay for this!

894
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:22,673
Sen, over here!

895
01:36:39,124 --> 01:36:41,388
There he is
Over here!

896
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:43,085
Don't call him over

897
01:36:46,965 --> 01:36:50,594
He's only bad in the bath house
He needs to get out of there

898
01:36:50,802 --> 01:36:52,929
But take him where?

899
01:36:53,104 --> 01:36:54,071
I don't know...

900
01:36:54,172 --> 01:36:58,609
You don't know...
He's following us

901
01:37:16,194 --> 01:37:17,183
From here, you walk

902
01:37:17,295 --> 01:37:18,284
OK

903
01:37:18,396 --> 01:37:20,125
You'll find the station

904
01:37:20,298 --> 01:37:21,663
Thank you

905
01:37:22,334 --> 01:37:23,892
You better come back!

906
01:37:24,169 --> 01:37:25,136
OK

907
01:37:29,341 --> 01:37:32,799
I know I called you a klutz!

908
01:37:32,978 --> 01:37:34,468
I take it back!

909
01:37:42,687 --> 01:37:46,748
No Face, if you so much as
touch that girl, you'll pay for it!

910
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:51,423
There it is

911
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:05,373
Train's coming, here we go

912
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,027
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom

913
01:38:37,742 --> 01:38:39,369
You want to come, too?

914
01:38:40,912 --> 01:38:42,880
Him too, please

915
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:24,752
Come here

916
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:27,015
Behave yourself, OK?

917
01:41:29,247 --> 01:41:30,646
Kamaji

918
01:41:33,084 --> 01:41:35,678
Oh, Haku...
You're awake

919
01:41:35,787 --> 01:41:37,220
Where's Sen?

920
01:41:37,756 --> 01:41:40,224
What happened, please tell me

921
01:41:40,592 --> 01:41:43,390
Don't you remember anything?

922
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:46,087
Just little pieces

923
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:49,391
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness

924
01:41:49,734 --> 01:41:53,602
I followed her voice and
woke up lying here...

925
01:41:54,105 --> 01:41:56,073
Chihiro, huh...

926
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:58,937
Her real name's Chihiro?

927
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:03,009
Can't beat the power of love...

928
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:09,879
This gold hardly
covers the damage

929
01:42:09,988 --> 01:42:12,786
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune

930
01:42:13,424 --> 01:42:17,087
But, Sen did save us, after all

931
01:42:17,262 --> 01:42:18,388
Silence!

932
01:42:18,496 --> 01:42:20,930
She started it all,

933
01:42:21,032 --> 01:42:23,364
and now she's run away

934
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:26,028
Even abandoned
her own parents!

935
01:42:26,805 --> 01:42:30,536
They must be fine fat pigs by now
Turn them into bacon or ham

936
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,602
Please wait

937
01:42:33,778 --> 01:42:34,904
Master Haku!

938
01:42:35,013 --> 01:42:37,140
What, you still alive?

939
01:42:39,651 --> 01:42:42,950
You still can't see that
you've lost something precious?

940
01:42:43,488 --> 01:42:46,286
You've gotten pretty fresh

941
01:42:46,457 --> 01:42:48,857
Since when do you talk that way?

942
01:43:40,545 --> 01:43:42,513
Baby...

943
01:43:48,519 --> 01:43:50,146
Baby!

944
01:43:50,255 --> 01:43:51,187
It's just sand!

945
01:43:51,389 --> 01:43:54,187
Baby!

946
01:43:54,692 --> 01:43:58,389
Where are you, baby!

947
01:43:58,863 --> 01:44:01,457
Come out, please!

948
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,428
Baby!

949
01:44:06,738 --> 01:44:09,036
Baby, baby!

950
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:18,080
You!

951
01:44:19,417 --> 01:44:22,716
Tell me!

952
01:44:24,255 --> 01:44:28,385
Where did you hide my baby?!

953
01:44:28,893 --> 01:44:30,690
He's with Zeniba

954
01:44:30,795 --> 01:44:32,763
Zeniba?

955
01:44:53,785 --> 01:44:57,516
I get it, that evil witch

956
01:44:57,655 --> 01:45:00,283
So she thinks she's beaten me

957
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,087
So, what's your plan?

958
01:45:04,595 --> 01:45:06,756
I'll bring baby back

959
01:45:06,931 --> 01:45:11,095
But in exchange, return Sen and
her parents to the human world

960
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:13,597
And what becomes of you?!

961
01:45:13,972 --> 01:45:17,601
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

962
01:46:04,522 --> 01:46:06,513
I think this is the right stop...

963
01:46:07,492 --> 01:46:08,754
Let's go

964
01:46:35,586 --> 01:46:37,417
You can ride on my shoulder

965
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:57,662
Come in

966
01:48:02,507 --> 01:48:04,304
Excuse us

967
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,676
Well, hurry up and come in, then

968
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,477
C'mon

969
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:15,615
So you all made it

970
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,311
Um...

971
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:18,149
Have a seat

972
01:48:18,322 --> 01:48:20,688
I'll make you some tea

973
01:48:26,364 --> 01:48:30,494
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you
I brought it back

974
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:36,203
Do you know what this is?

975
01:48:36,674 --> 01:48:39,643
No, but I know it's very precious

976
01:48:39,744 --> 01:48:43,339
I'm here to apologize for Haku
I'm sorry

977
01:48:44,282 --> 01:48:47,308
You felt fine while you held it?

978
01:48:47,418 --> 01:48:48,350
What?

979
01:48:48,452 --> 01:48:51,046
What's this?
The spell is gone

980
01:48:52,356 --> 01:48:55,484
I'm sorry
I stepped on that strange bug

981
01:48:55,593 --> 01:48:57,356
that was on the seal
and squashed it

982
01:48:57,962 --> 01:49:00,089
Squashed it!

983
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,499
You know, my sister snuck
that bug into the dragon,

984
01:49:05,603 --> 01:49:08,401
so she could control
her apprentice

985
01:49:08,539 --> 01:49:11,030
Squashed it!

986
01:49:13,878 --> 01:49:15,607
You sit too

987
01:49:15,713 --> 01:49:18,409
You're No Face, aren't you?
You sit, too

988
01:49:19,483 --> 01:49:23,180
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves

989
01:49:23,287 --> 01:49:26,381
Why my dears,
the spell's long broken

990
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:28,890
You can turn yourselves back

991
01:49:36,234 --> 01:49:40,034
My sister and I are two halves of
a whole, but we really don't get along

992
01:49:40,137 --> 01:49:42,731
You've seen what
bad taste she has

993
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,900
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble

994
01:49:49,947 --> 01:49:54,407
I'd like to help you, dear
but there's nothing I can do

995
01:49:54,585 --> 01:49:56,450
It's one of our rules here

996
01:49:57,088 --> 01:50:00,057
You've got to take care of your
parents and that dragon boyfriend

997
01:50:00,157 --> 01:50:01,818
of yours, on your own

998
01:50:01,926 --> 01:50:04,759
But, um, can't you
even give me a hint?

999
01:50:05,263 --> 01:50:08,824
I feel like Haku and I met,
a long time ago

1000
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:10,764
In that case, it's easy

1001
01:50:11,135 --> 01:50:13,763
Nothing that happens,
is ever forgotten,

1002
01:50:13,938 --> 01:50:16,031
even if you
can't remember it

1003
01:50:17,441 --> 01:50:20,706
It's already late
Why don't you stay the night?

1004
01:50:21,145 --> 01:50:23,943
You boys give me a hand

1005
01:50:30,121 --> 01:50:32,055
Keep at it

1006
01:50:35,126 --> 01:50:39,290
That's right, you're terrific
You're a big help...

1007
01:50:40,164 --> 01:50:43,395
A magic one
won't do the trick

1008
01:50:44,802 --> 01:50:49,068
Pull it through there...
And do it again

1009
01:50:49,307 --> 01:50:51,969
I really have to
go home, granny

1010
01:50:52,576 --> 01:50:56,034
Haku could die while
I'm just sitting here...

1011
01:50:56,247 --> 01:50:59,739
They might eat my mom and dad!

1012
01:51:01,986 --> 01:51:04,716
Just wait a little longer

1013
01:51:04,822 --> 01:51:06,312
There we are

1014
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:09,421
Use it tie back your hair

1015
01:51:13,597 --> 01:51:15,155
It's so pretty

1016
01:51:15,499 --> 01:51:20,266
It'll protect you
I made it from the thread they spun

1017
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:22,195
Thank you

1018
01:51:31,515 --> 01:51:35,349
What good timing
We've got another guest, let him in

1019
01:51:35,453 --> 01:51:36,511
Sure

1020
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:50,856
Haku!

1021
01:51:52,203 --> 01:51:53,693
Haku!

1022
01:51:54,205 --> 01:51:55,729
Thank goodness

1023
01:51:56,073 --> 01:51:58,541
Aren't you hurt?
You sure you're OK?

1024
01:51:58,876 --> 01:51:59,706
Thank goodness

1025
01:52:01,712 --> 01:52:03,907
Good timing, I'd say

1026
01:52:04,582 --> 01:52:07,050
Look, granny, Haku's alive

1027
01:52:07,585 --> 01:52:11,715
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did

1028
01:52:11,889 --> 01:52:15,086
Just be sure you protect the girl

1029
01:52:15,593 --> 01:52:18,528
OK, boys, time you went home

1030
01:52:18,629 --> 01:52:20,722
Come again soon

1031
01:52:21,432 --> 01:52:25,766
You, stick around
and be my helper

1032
01:52:28,272 --> 01:52:29,102
Granny!

1033
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:32,034
Thank you, I'm going now

1034
01:52:32,143 --> 01:52:35,237
I'm sure you can
manage everything

1035
01:52:35,346 --> 01:52:38,577
My real name is Chihiro

1036
01:52:38,749 --> 01:52:41,217
Chihiro... what a nice name

1037
01:52:41,318 --> 01:52:43,309
Take good care of it,
it's yours

1038
01:52:43,421 --> 01:52:44,012
I will!

1039
01:52:44,121 --> 01:52:45,918
Off you go

1040
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:50,685
Thank you, granny
Good bye

1041
01:53:39,844 --> 01:53:41,471
Listen, Haku

1042
01:53:41,645 --> 01:53:45,137
I don't remember it, but
my mom told me...

1043
01:53:45,583 --> 01:53:49,144
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river

1044
01:53:49,687 --> 01:53:53,316
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top

1045
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:55,818
But I've just remembered

1046
01:53:56,994 --> 01:53:58,586
The river was called...

1047
01:53:59,029 --> 01:54:02,157
Its name was the Kohaku River

1048
01:54:02,833 --> 01:54:05,996
Your real name is Kohaku

1049
01:54:27,391 --> 01:54:28,858
Chihiro, thank you

1050
01:54:29,026 --> 01:54:32,189
My real name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1051
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:33,697
Nigihayami?

1052
01:54:33,864 --> 01:54:36,094
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1053
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,634
What a name
Sounds like a god

1054
01:54:39,069 --> 01:54:43,506
I remember too, how
you fell into me as a child

1055
01:54:43,607 --> 01:54:45,199
You had dropped your shoe

1056
01:54:45,743 --> 01:54:49,873
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water, Kohaku

1057
01:54:50,748 --> 01:54:51,874
I'm so grateful...

1058
01:55:24,782 --> 01:55:26,181
They're back!

1059
01:55:39,463 --> 01:55:42,432
You brought Baby back
with you, right?

1060
01:55:45,102 --> 01:55:46,000
Baba!

1061
01:55:46,103 --> 01:55:50,506
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had

1062
01:55:51,775 --> 01:55:54,767
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When?

1063
01:55:55,479 --> 01:55:57,606
Yubaba, you promised

1064
01:55:57,781 --> 01:56:00,545
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world

1065
01:56:01,151 --> 01:56:03,619
Not so fast

1066
01:56:03,787 --> 01:56:06,722
This world has rules, you know!

1067
01:56:07,491 --> 01:56:08,651
Shut up!

1068
01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:11,283
Baba, what a miser
Just can it

1069
01:56:11,662 --> 01:56:14,153
Baby had such a good time

1070
01:56:14,665 --> 01:56:17,463
But, a rule's a rule

1071
01:56:17,635 --> 01:56:19,796
Otherwise I can't break the spell

1072
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:23,162
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba

1073
01:56:23,807 --> 01:56:24,933
Why that's...

1074
01:56:25,042 --> 01:56:26,475
Granny

1075
01:56:26,577 --> 01:56:27,669
Granny!?

1076
01:56:28,178 --> 01:56:30,169
I'm coming to you

1077
01:56:41,659 --> 01:56:43,957
Haku told me all about the rule

1078
01:56:44,061 --> 01:56:45,892
Least you've got guts

1079
01:56:45,996 --> 01:56:49,227
Here's your contract
Come over here

1080
01:56:49,366 --> 01:56:51,766
I won't be a minute, Baby

1081
01:56:52,536 --> 01:56:53,833
Don't worry

1082
01:56:58,342 --> 01:57:02,108
See if you can guess
which of them are yours

1083
01:57:11,522 --> 01:57:12,989
You only get one guess

1084
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:15,558
Get it right, and you're all free

1085
01:57:27,571 --> 01:57:31,063
Granny, this is no good
My parents aren't here

1086
01:57:31,542 --> 01:57:34,875
Not here?!
That's your answer?

1087
01:57:36,547 --> 01:57:37,411
Yes

1088
01:57:40,384 --> 01:57:43,547
Bingo!

1089
01:57:43,721 --> 01:57:46,155
Thattagirl!
Right on!

1090
01:57:50,094 --> 01:57:51,391
Thank you, everyone

1091
01:57:51,562 --> 01:57:54,759
Go! You win
Just get out of here!

1092
01:57:55,265 --> 01:57:57,165
Thank you for everything

1093
01:57:57,901 --> 01:57:59,163
Good bye

1094
01:57:59,937 --> 01:58:01,029
Thank you

1095
01:58:01,138 --> 01:58:02,105
Come and see us

1096
01:58:02,573 --> 01:58:03,130
Haku

1097
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,172
Let's go

1098
01:58:04,942 --> 01:58:06,204
Where are Mom and Dad?

1099
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:07,436
They've gone on ahead

1100
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:16,416
There's no water!

1101
01:58:16,587 --> 01:58:18,020
I can't go any farther

1102
01:58:18,589 --> 01:58:20,921
Go back the way
you came, Chihiro

1103
01:58:21,024 --> 01:58:24,016
But don't ever look back
Not until you're out of the tunnel

1104
01:58:24,294 --> 01:58:26,262
What about you, Haku?

1105
01:58:26,797 --> 01:58:29,595
I'll speak to Yubaba
Quit my apprenticeship

1106
01:58:29,767 --> 01:58:32,133
I'm fine, now that I have
my name back

1107
01:58:32,803 --> 01:58:34,600
I'll go back to my world, too

1108
01:58:34,772 --> 01:58:36,171
Can we meet again?

1109
01:58:36,273 --> 01:58:37,103
I'm sure

1110
01:58:37,207 --> 01:58:37,764
Promise

1111
01:58:37,941 --> 01:58:38,805
Promise

1112
01:58:38,942 --> 01:58:41,433
Now go, and don't look back

1113
01:59:04,168 --> 01:59:05,635
Chihiro!

1114
01:59:06,136 --> 01:59:08,627
Where have you been?
Hurry up

1115
01:59:12,309 --> 01:59:14,106
Mom! Dad!

1116
01:59:14,211 --> 01:59:15,974
You can't just run off like that

1117
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:17,376
Away we go

1118
01:59:17,848 --> 01:59:19,975
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

1119
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:24,348
What? I'm sure the moving
van's there by now

1120
01:59:33,764 --> 01:59:35,994
Hurry along, Chihiro

1121
01:59:44,708 --> 01:59:46,471
Watch your step

1122
01:59:46,577 --> 01:59:49,842
You'll make me trip, Chihiro
clinging like that

1123
02:00:02,125 --> 02:00:03,592
The end of the tunnel

1124
02:00:04,027 --> 02:00:05,221
Hey...

1125
02:00:05,562 --> 02:00:06,859
What is it?

1126
02:00:07,731 --> 02:00:09,631
Will you look at that

1127
02:00:10,734 --> 02:00:13,202
It's all dusty inside, too

1128
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:14,166
Some kind of joke?

1129
02:00:14,271 --> 02:00:15,363
You think?

1130
02:00:15,472 --> 02:00:17,940
I told you not to stop here

1131
02:00:23,547 --> 02:00:25,981
OK, all clear

1132
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:29,515
We're off, Chihiro

1133
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,384
Hurry up, Chihiro!

1134
02:00:59,508 --> 02:01:05,105
<i>Somewhere, a voice calls,
in the depths of my heart</i>

1135
02:01:05,314 --> 02:01:10,946
<i>May I always be dreaming,
the dreams that move my heart</i>

1136
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,649
<i>So many tears, of sadness,
uncountable through and through</i>

1137
02:01:16,926 --> 02:01:22,865
<i>I know on the other side of them,
I'll find you</i>

1138
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:29,333
<i>Everytime we fall down to the ground,
we look up to the blue sky above</i>

1139
02:01:29,438 --> 02:01:34,341
<i>We wake to its blueness, as for
the first time</i>

1140
02:01:34,443 --> 02:01:40,109
<i>Though the road is long and lonely and
the end far away, out of sight</i>

1141
02:01:40,216 --> 02:01:45,813
<i>I can with these two arms,
embrace the light</i>

1142
02:01:47,957 --> 02:01:53,691
<i>As I bid farewell, my heart stops,
in tenderness I feel</i>

1143
02:01:53,863 --> 02:01:59,460
<i>My silent empty body begins to listen to
what is real</i>

1144
02:01:59,635 --> 02:02:05,437
<i>The wonder of living,
the wonder of dying</i>

1145
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:11,707
<i>The wind, town and flowers,
we all dance one unity</i>

1146
02:02:37,673 --> 02:02:43,168
<i>Somewhere, a voice calls,
in the depths of my heart</i>

1147
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:48,842
<i>Keep dreaming your dreams,
don't ever let them part</i>

1148
02:02:49,018 --> 02:02:54,456
<i>Why speak of all your sadness or
of life’s painful woes</i>

1149
02:02:54,557 --> 02:03:00,427
<i>Instead let the same lips sing
a gentle song for you</i>

1150
02:03:01,230 --> 02:03:06,862
<i>The whispering voice, we never want
to forget, in each passing memory</i>

1151
02:03:07,036 --> 02:03:11,769
<i>Always there to guide you</i>

1152
02:03:12,041 --> 02:03:17,536
<i>When a mirror has been broken,
shattered pieces scattered on the ground</i>

1153
02:03:17,713 --> 02:03:23,151
<i>Glimpses of new life,
reflected all around</i>

1154
02:03:25,588 --> 02:03:31,049
<i>Window of beginning, stillness,
new light of the dawn</i>

1155
02:03:31,293 --> 02:03:37,061
<i>Let my silent empty body be filled
and reborn</i>

1156
02:03:37,166 --> 02:03:42,433
<i>No need to search outside,
nor sail across the sea</i>

1157
02:03:42,605 --> 02:03:47,736
<i>Cause here shining inside me,
it's right here inside me</i>

1158
02:03:47,843 --> 02:03:55,113
<i>I've found a brightness,
it's always with me</i>
