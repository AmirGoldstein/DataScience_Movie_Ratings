1
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,107
It's small!

2
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,997
No, please. No! Please!

3
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:02,582
Davey!

4
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,085
Come running, lad!

5
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,048
Stop!
Brand you like a damn steer, bitch!

6
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:14,386
No. Please!
- Hold the bitch! Go on, hold her!

7
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,973
Hold her, damn it,
I'll cut her tits off!

8
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,308
Go get Skinny! Quick!

9
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,019
- Ah!
Mike, don't!

10
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,609
Skinny!

11
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,070
Think it's funny?

12
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,824
Skinny, get the gun!

13
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:39,202
The gun, Skinny!

14
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,628
Get off of her, cowboy.

15
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:57,929
Wouldn't let you settle it?
You know Skinny.

16
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:01,558
He says he'll shoot them.
I says, "You can't."

17
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,228
He says, "Get Little Bill."
I says, "He's sleeping."

18
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:09,149
He says he don't care.
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,122
She gonna die?

20
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,166
She's gonna live.

21
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,171
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,090
When she seen
his teensy little pecker...

23
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:38,470
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,974
You can hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,993
Clyde...

26
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:07,332
...step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.

27
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,002
A whipping's all they get
after what they done?

28
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,007
- It ain't no little thing, Alice.
- But what they done...

29
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,802
Alice! Shut up!

30
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:24,391
- Whipping ain't gonna settle this.
- No?

31
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:29,688
Here's a contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

32
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:34,359
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

33
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,280
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

34
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,823
Property.

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,866
Damaged property.

36
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,704
Like if I hamstrung
one of their ponies.

37
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,417
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

38
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,711
Hell, no!

39
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,754
Won't pay to do it.

40
00:04:55,088 --> 00:05:00,468
She can clean, but nobody's gonna pay
good money for a cut-up whore!

41
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:07,183
You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own string of ponies?

42
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,936
Yeah, I got four.

43
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,149
Six.

44
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,403
You just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss?

45
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,405
No, sir.

46
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,449
All right.

47
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,743
You did the cutting.

48
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,580
Come the fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny here.

49
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,498
Five?

50
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:33,126
And you!
You bring in two.

51
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,942
You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,466
Here's the bullwhip, Bill.

53
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,969
Maybe we don't need this now.

54
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:49,100
Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...

55
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,647
- I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

56
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,734
I fined them instead, Alice.

57
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,695
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

58
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,948
That ain't fair.

59
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,533
That ain't fair!

60
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,251
Haven't you seen
enough blood tonight?

61
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,673
Hell, Alice!

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,222
It ain't like they was tramps or
loafers or bad men. They were just...

63
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,642
...hardworking boys that was foolish.

64
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,813
- If they was given over to wickedness...
- Like whores?

65
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,525
Alice? Tend to Delilah.

66
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,779
Go ahead.

67
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,594
I got $85.

68
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,304
I don't know.

69
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:12,058
If Delilah doesn't care,
why are we so riled up?

70
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,979
Just because we let them fools
ride us like horses...

71
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,691
...don't mean we let them
brand us like horses.

72
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:24,946
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but, by God, we ain't horses!

73
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,908
I got $112.

74
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,327
That's everything.

75
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:34,289
How about you, Faith?

76
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,543
Two hundred.

77
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,838
Two hundred and forty dollars.

78
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,383
Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?

79
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,303
Been giving Skinny something special?

80
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,851
She laughed.

81
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,941
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue...

82
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,401
It ain't enough.

83
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,113
Not yet, maybe.

84
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:50,281
You don't look like no
rootin'-tootin'...

85
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,701
...son of a bitching
cold-blooded assassin.

86
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,040
Say what?

87
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,920
My guess is you're calling yourself
Mr. William Munny.

88
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:07,423
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

89
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:11,594
The same one who shot Charlie Pepper
in Lake County?

90
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,346
Pa! Hey, Pa!

91
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,014
What's up, son?

92
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,225
Two more hogs got the fever.

93
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,310
You shot Charlie Pepper.

94
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,897
You killed William Harvey
and robbed that train in Missouri.

95
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,399
Hold on, mister.

96
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,319
Son, get those hogs separated there.

97
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,446
Penny, help your brother.

98
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,200
That one's sick too?
Yeah.

99
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,330
We'll talk inside.

100
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,716
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

101
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:56,347
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

102
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,018
I could have. Easy.

103
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,522
I guess maybe so.

104
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:10,987
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

105
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,531
Maybe I ain't.

106
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:18,161
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son of a bitch alive.

107
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:23,207
And if I wanted a partner
for a killing, you were the worst one.

108
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,546
Meaning the best.

109
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,507
On account as
you're as cold as snow...

110
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:34,636
...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

111
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,931
Pete said that?

112
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,268
Yeah, he did.

113
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,812
I'm a killer myself, except...

114
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:48,274
...I ain't killed as many as you
because of my youth.

115
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:52,153
Schofield Kid,
that's what they call me.

116
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,573
Why?

117
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,076
You from Schofield?

118
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,078
No, it's on account...

119
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,790
...of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.

120
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,129
How about it, Will?

121
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,715
How about what?

122
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,426
How about being my partner?

123
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:21,474
I'm heading north through Niobrara
to Wyoming to kill two no-good cowboys.

124
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,435
For what?

125
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:28,690
For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.

126
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,734
Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.

127
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,987
They even cut her teats.

128
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,450
Jesus.

129
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,620
$1000 reward, Will.

130
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,373
500 apiece.

131
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,710
Pa?

132
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,754
I can't move those damn pigs!

133
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:56,384
Watch your cussing, will you?
Do the best you can with it.

134
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,304
Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.

135
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,604
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

136
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:13,526
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

137
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,987
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

138
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,158
My wife, she cured me of that.

139
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,620
Cured me of drinking and wickedness.

140
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,499
You don't look so prosperous.

141
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,671
You could buy her a new dress
with your half.

142
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:38,551
- If we kill them, you can buy your...
- She's passed on.

143
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,136
What?

144
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,518
- Been gone near 3 years now.
- Oh.

145
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:56,110
Don't tell no one about the reward.
I don't need other gunmen collecting.

146
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:00,490
- We don't see no one out here.
- Yeah.

147
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,452
If you was to change your mind,
I'll be riding due west...

148
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,954
...for the trail into Wyoming.

149
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,671
Come on, let's separate those hogs.

150
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:48,955
Two others.
I think they got the fever.

151
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,056
Took you boys a while.

152
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:53,644
A few more days and I was
gonna call on the sheriff.

153
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,146
How about that?

154
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:58,524
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

155
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,569
I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses to the livery.

156
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,447
Neil, take that one
over around the back.

157
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:10,661
Yeah. Come on. Get them in there.
Come on.

158
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,457
Now there's a beauty.

159
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,793
You got two of mine.
This here one ain't yours.

160
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:19,795
We'll see about that.

161
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:24,467
Bastards! Get out of town!

162
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,888
Sick sons of bitches!

163
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,890
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

164
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:36,187
Don't come back, butcher!
- This here pony...

165
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,774
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

166
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,863
Whoa. Whoa.

167
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,204
She's the best.

168
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,545
Better than the ones I gave him.

169
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,717
She can sell her...

170
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,011
...or do what she wants.

171
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:17,478
A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you give her a mangy pony?

172
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:19,814
She ain't mangy!

173
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,483
Get out of here!

174
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,070
Whoa! Whoa!
We don't need your damn charity!

175
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:31,158
Get out of our town
and don't come back!

176
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,244
Get out of our town!

177
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,194
Did Pa used to kill folks?

178
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,850
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

179
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,938
He ain't a saddle horse no more.
Ain't used to the feel.

180
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,065
Take care of your sister, son.

181
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:13,070
Kill a few chickens if you must.
Keep those hogs with the fever separate.

182
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,033
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

183
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,583
Whoa, whoa.

184
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:46,478
Ain't been in the saddle myself
in a while.

185
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,861
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

186
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:58,282
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

187
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:02,995
...I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.

188
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:11,921
This horse
and those hogs over there...

189
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:17,927
...are getting even
for the cruelty I inflicted.

190
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,929
I used to be able to cuss...

191
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,683
...and whip a horse, but your ma
showed me the error of my ways.

192
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,812
I'll be back in two weeks.

193
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:34,109
Remember the spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

194
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:54,004
Where'd you get the money?
We ain't got any!

195
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,591
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

196
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,718
Lying?

197
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:04,348
What'll you do
if somebody comes to collect?

198
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,434
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

199
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:15,442
The kind of people who come for it
won't tolerate you not having it!

200
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,156
They won't just cut up your face!

201
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,704
You stupid bitches.

202
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:29,373
You stupid bitches!

203
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:42,928
Shit!

204
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,639
Damn it! Jesus!

205
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,851
Hit your finger?

206
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,896
Hello, Skinny.

207
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,357
Damn, you snuck up on me.

208
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,193
What do you think of her?

209
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:00,988
I heard you done the roof yourself.

210
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:05,826
Roof? Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

211
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,955
The Roberts boy carried wood for me,
but that's all.

212
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,082
What is all that wood?

213
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,128
I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening...

214
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,924
...and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

215
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:26,513
Came out here just
to take a look at her?

216
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,766
Oh, them whores...
Yeah?

217
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:34,480
Been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last two weeks.

218
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,398
Shit, Skinny.

219
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,028
We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.

220
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,114
You'll be the first billiard baron.

221
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:48,285
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

222
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,538
...they'll pay $1000 to whoever...

223
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,792
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

224
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:01,256
Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

225
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,385
Yeah.

226
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,682
All week long?

227
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,435
I didn't hear till last night myself.

228
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,897
The word's probably got
all the way to Texas by now.

229
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,277
Nobody'll come clear from Texas.

230
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,239
You sure they got that money?

231
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,994
Women can lie. Asked where the
money is, they say they got none.

232
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:35,541
But those five could have
squirreled it away. Maybe.

233
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,212
That much?

234
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,466
You could run off them two cowboys.

235
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,636
I could run off them whores.

236
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,474
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

237
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:58,730
Nope. They'll stay out at the Bar T.

238
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,608
Close to their friends.

239
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,821
Shit, could be nobody
won't come at all.

240
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,576
Got to go.
I like your house.

241
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,196
Well, I'll be...

242
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,032
It's Will!

243
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,497
Hey, Will.

244
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,540
Come in the house out of the sun.

245
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,125
Ned.
- Sally...

246
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,795
- ...see to Will's horse.
- Sally.

247
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,635
What are you doing here?

248
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,055
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

249
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,308
We ain't bad men no more.

250
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,310
We're farmers.

251
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:23,524
Should be easy killing them,
if they don't go on down to Texas.

252
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:29,238
How long since you fired a gun
at a man? Nine, ten years?

253
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,991
Eleven.

254
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:35,744
Easy, huh?

255
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,831
I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.

256
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,960
And we was young and full of beans.

257
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,254
If you was mad at them...

258
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,632
...over some wrong,
I could see shooting them.

259
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,010
We done stuff for money before.

260
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,138
Yeah.

261
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,683
We thought we did.

262
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,978
What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?

263
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:04,773
Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

264
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,567
They cut up a woman.

265
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,235
What?

266
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:14,825
Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

267
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,870
Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.

268
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,291
I'll be dogged.

269
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,630
Guess they got it coming.

270
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,717
Of course, Will...

271
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:37,014
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

272
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:49,192
Could you look in on my youngsters
next week?

273
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,737
They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.

274
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,155
Will?

275
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,409
How long you reckon you're gonna be?

276
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,412
Two weeks, I guess.

277
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,541
Will?

278
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,922
Um...

279
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,009
What's this Kid like?

280
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,472
Three ways?

281
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,268
I see you still have
that Spencer rifle.

282
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:25,187
Yeah.

283
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:29,608
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying too.

284
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,576
Jesus, Will!

285
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,094
He must be moving right along.

286
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,098
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

287
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,610
Kind of got used to my bed.

288
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,281
This ain't going to be like no home.

289
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,200
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

290
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,786
Boy, I'm gonna...

291
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,082
Hell, I'm sorry.

292
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,211
Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.

293
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,384
She don't like it much,
you riding off with me.

294
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,179
- Sally?
- Gave me the evil eye.

295
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,393
You know, Sally's injun...

296
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,438
...and injuns ain't over-friendly.

297
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,066
I don't blame her.

298
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,403
I won't hold it against her.

299
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,572
She knew me back then.

300
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,574
She knew what a...

301
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,577
...no-good son of a bitch I was.

302
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,998
She ain't allowing that I changed.

303
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,585
She don't realize I ain't
like that no more.

304
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,171
- You know, Will...
- I ain't the same.

305
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:02,427
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

306
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,555
Going on this killing...

307
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,892
...don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

308
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:11,937
Just need the money.

309
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:16,817
- Get a new start for them youngsters.
- Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,365
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

311
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,701
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

312
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,207
- Yeah.
- I think about him now and again.

313
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:37,796
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

314
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:41,842
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

315
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,640
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

316
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,855
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought...

317
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,607
...I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

318
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:02,070
You ain't like that no more.

319
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,156
Eagle, he hated my guts.

320
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,536
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

321
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,746
Quincy neither, I reckon.

322
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:17,168
Quincy used to just watch
all the time...

323
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,088
...scared.

324
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,757
Like I said...

325
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,012
...you ain't like that no more.

326
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,513
That's right.

327
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,017
I'm just a fellow now.

328
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,103
I ain't no different
than anyone else...

329
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,105
...no more.

330
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:57,500
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

331
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:02,255
No, the would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

332
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,301
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

333
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:10,472
...but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

334
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,724
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

335
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,645
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

336
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:21,650
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T...

337
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,570
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

338
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:31,618
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

339
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:36,164
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

340
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:41,127
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

341
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,838
The majesty of royalty, you see.

342
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,844
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

343
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,263
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

344
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,433
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

345
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,436
- When I heard about queens...
Shut up, Joe.

346
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,439
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude...

347
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,567
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

348
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,613
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

349
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:12,701
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol...

350
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,577
...so he can shoot him.

351
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,967
Is that a fact, mister?

352
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,885
You English Bob?

353
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,181
Pheasants.

354
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,977
Let's shoot some pheasants.

355
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,478
Ten shots.

356
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,481
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

357
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,318
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

358
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,320
...for whomever.

359
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:11,092
That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

360
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,678
Pretty damn good shooting...

361
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,597
...for a John Bull.

362
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:20,435
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

363
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,773
...over the injury to your president.

364
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,403
Come on, yeah!

365
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,163
It's the climate that does it.
And the infernal distances.

366
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,414
Does what?

367
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,876
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

368
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,672
- Yeah, uh...
It's a savage country.

369
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,134
That's the second one
shot in 20 years.

370
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,721
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

371
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,261
Come on.

372
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,107
Whoa. Whoa.

373
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,113
Thank you.

374
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,284
Pardon me, gentlemen.

375
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:07,041
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

376
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,335
Proper authority?

377
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:17,886
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

378
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,265
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

379
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,893
...and the forbearance of reptiles.

380
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:40,158
Unarmed, my ass!

381
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,619
Christ, it's hot!

382
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,457
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

383
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:51,836
Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit...

384
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,296
Shut up, Fatty!

385
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:56,925
- I only say that...
- Clyde's back.

386
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:59,052
With Little Bill?
- No.

387
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:00,887
Shit!

388
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:09,103
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

389
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,148
Where's Little Bill?

390
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,275
Building his damn porch.

391
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,361
Building his porch?

392
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:20,281
If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?

393
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,283
I ain't gonna get shot.

394
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,370
He's coming?

395
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,164
Of course he's coming.

396
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,375
I just loaded that.

397
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:34,837
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

398
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,256
What'd he say?

399
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,676
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

400
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:43,263
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

401
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:47,433
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

402
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,562
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

403
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,442
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

404
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:01,406
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

405
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,741
He didn't say nothing?

406
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,453
Asked what they looked like.

407
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,915
Maybe he's tough, but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

408
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,209
Maybe he ain't so tough.

409
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,130
Seem like he was scared?

410
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,049
Little Bill? Him scared?

411
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,554
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

412
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:26,848
Killers.

413
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:30,852
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

414
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,062
He worked them tough towns.

415
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,731
Just wondered.

416
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,609
Anybody could be scared.

417
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,616
He wasn't scared, boys.

418
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:49,829
He just ain't no carpenter.

419
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,878
There's a dignity in royalty...

420
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:59,922
...which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

421
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,050
Uh-huh.
- If you pointed a pistol...

422
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,595
...at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

423
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:09,390
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

424
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,476
That's a wise policy.

425
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,897
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

426
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:19,442
...would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed.

427
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:20,860
Right.
- You would stand...

428
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,447
How shall I put it?
In awe.

429
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:32,163
A president...
Why not shoot a president?

430
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,337
- Keep the change.
Thank you.

431
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:43,341
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

432
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,345
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

433
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,139
Say you want a game of billiards.

434
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,516
- Billiards?
- Uh-huh.

435
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,684
Even though
I don't really wish to play?

436
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,772
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

437
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,024
Quite right.

438
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,569
Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea...

439
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:20,336
Hello, Bob.

440
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,508
Boys, this here is English Bob.

441
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,928
Shit and fried eggs.

442
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,015
Been a long time.

443
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,768
Run out of Chinamen?

444
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:40,398
I thought that you were dead.

445
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,985
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

446
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:48,573
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

447
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,243
Actually, what I heard was,
you fell off your horse...

448
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,911
...drunk, of course.

449
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,789
And that you broke your bloody neck.

450
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,460
I heard that one myself, Bob.

451
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,545
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

452
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:06,090
Till I found out
I was just in Nebraska.

453
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,134
Who's he?

454
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:11,220
- W.W. Beauchamp.
- Beauchamp.

455
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:14,724
This is Little Bill Daggett.

456
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,934
- And friends, of course.
- Daggett?

457
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,480
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

458
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,982
In person.

459
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,652
You work for the railroads too?

460
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,531
No. I write.

461
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:31,949
Letters?

462
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,160
Books, Bill. Books.

463
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:36,329
Actually...

464
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:39,373
...he's my biographer.

465
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:49,467
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

466
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,849
It's only a book.

467
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:58,476
A book?

468
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,318
That means you boys can read.

469
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:13,324
That means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms.

470
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,746
But like you told young Andy...

471
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:22,291
...you're not armed, are you?

472
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,043
Not really, Bill.

473
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:29,048
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

474
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:33,553
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

475
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,846
I'm afraid so, Bob.

476
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,684
I don't like firearms around.

477
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,291
Be very careful with it, sonny.

478
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,337
Charley?

479
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,174
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

480
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,181
Make sure you don't get wet.

481
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,522
No shit.

482
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:30,192
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

483
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,530
<i>The Duck of Death?</i>

484
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,073
Duke.

485
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:39,243
"The Duke."

486
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:44,415
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

487
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,792
I'll have that .32, Bob.

488
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,599
Now, Little Bill...

489
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:05,603
...you will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

490
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,901
Enemies?

491
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:18,658
You been talking about the queen again?

492
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:20,076
On Independence Day?

493
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:27,667
Easy. Easy. Easy.

494
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:36,217
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

495
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,094
But it ain't so!

496
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,388
What I'm doing is talking!

497
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:44,517
You hear?!
Talking to all those goons down there in Kansas!

498
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,269
To all those villains in Missouri!

499
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,278
And those villains...

500
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,573
...down in Cheyenne!

501
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:09,375
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

502
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:17,717
Even if there was,
they wouldn't want to come for it...

503
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:18,968
...anyhow!

504
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:51,208
What are you looking at?!
Go on!

505
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,252
Scoot!

506
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,509
Mind your own business!

507
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:28,704
Hey, Will.

508
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:30,915
Ever go into town?

509
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:35,586
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

510
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:37,463
No, no, I mean...

511
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,840
I mean, get yourself a woman.

512
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:45,596
No, I never go into town for that.

513
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:47,556
A man like me?

514
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,186
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

515
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,105
That ain't right, buying flesh.

516
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,194
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that...

517
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:01,904
...me being a father.

518
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:05,533
So...

519
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,787
You just use your hand?

520
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,127
I don't miss it all that much.

521
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:35,896
Will!

522
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:39,733
Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!

523
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,945
- Yeah.
- Shit. Did it hit you?

524
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:47,575
I bumped my head
falling off my horse.

525
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,957
Ain't shooting at us no more.

526
00:47:57,376 --> 00:47:59,128
Shooting way over yonder.

527
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,883
What the hell's he shooting at?

528
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,802
Beats the hell out of me.

529
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:11,140
Reckon we in somebody's field?

530
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,142
I didn't see nothing planted.

531
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,811
Shooting at us again.

532
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,776
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

533
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,654
- Hey!
- Wait! You'll mark us!

534
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,156
Hey, Kid!

535
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:33,162
- That's the Kid shooting at us?
- Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

536
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,748
What's he shooting at us for?

537
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:37,249
Is that you?

538
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:41,337
Yeah, it's me!

539
00:48:41,879 --> 00:48:45,007
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

540
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:48,761
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

541
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51,430
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

542
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:54,266
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

543
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,853
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

544
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:01,065
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

545
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,859
No, I ain't!

546
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:20,751
- Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What was you shooting at us for?

547
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,754
I thought you was following me.
- We was.

548
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:28,509
- You said if I changed my mind...
Nothing said about no partner.

549
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,053
This here's Ned Logan.

550
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,431
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

551
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:39,937
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is, you come to kill me.

552
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,147
We never talked about no other fellow.

553
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:47,277
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

554
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:51,365
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

555
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:56,870
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

556
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,914
Better than you, anyhow.

557
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:00,708
You wasn't even close.

558
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,460
Get your damn hands off my rifle!

559
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:16,640
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

560
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,350
It ain't bent.

561
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:23,188
- You were shooting all over!
- You'll share your half with him?

562
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:25,566
I figure three ways.

563
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:28,110
You figured wrong.

564
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,281
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

565
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,410
You going back with him?

566
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:39,329
He's my partner.

567
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,415
He don't go, I don't go.

568
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,380
What's it come to, three ways?

569
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:43,602
Shit!

570
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:48,607
- What are you pissing on about?
- What?

571
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:52,986
- What are you looking at, anyhow?
- Looking at?

572
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:54,613
Clouds, Kid.

573
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,867
Looking at them on account of
we got a storm riding up our ass.

574
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:03,539
Hell, I seen them.

575
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:17,469
You was smart to change your mind.

576
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,555
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

577
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:23,142
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

578
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:26,145
See that hawk?

579
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:32,568
I could hit it with one shot.

580
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:40,242
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

581
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:44,580
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

582
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:47,749
You can't see for shit, can you?

583
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,670
See your canteen?

584
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,595
How far can you see?

585
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:03,473
- Far enough.
- We ain't shooting canteens! How far?

586
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:05,976
- 100 yards?
- More.

587
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:09,062
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

588
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,191
- He's blind!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

589
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:14,026
Hold it!

590
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:17,404
How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?

591
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:20,741
You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.

592
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:24,536
I can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch.

593
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,079
Hold on.

594
00:53:26,622 --> 00:53:28,040
Hear that, Ned?

595
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,751
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

596
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:33,921
Jesus!

597
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:40,636
50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

598
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,022
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

599
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:57,319
Did you kill all seven of them?
Or just wing some of them?

600
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:06,411
That you here, Bob, on the cover?

601
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:10,499
"The Duck of Death"?

602
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,795
It's the Duke.
"Duke of Death."

603
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,507
Duke, yeah.

604
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:22,844
You always were the hell in Jesus
with a pistol, but seven of them?

605
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:27,349
Protecting that woman.
How do you do that?

606
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:29,977
Uh, you see, uh...

607
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:34,189
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

608
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:37,317
...liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

609
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,361
For reasons involving the marketplace...

610
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:44,616
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

611
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,870
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

612
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:53,000
...that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts.

613
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,876
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

614
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,796
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

615
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,300
The Duke.

616
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:03,010
Duck, I says.

617
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:15,647
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran...'

618
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,149
...said the Duck.

619
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,402
'You must apologize.'

620
00:55:20,736 --> 00:55:23,238
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

621
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,908
He reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

622
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:32,331
...but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns."

623
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:36,084
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

624
00:55:36,335 --> 00:55:40,714
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

625
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:42,924
Mr. Beauchamp.

626
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,095
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

627
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:50,932
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

628
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,851
I didn't see you there.

629
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:55,187
Nor no woman.

630
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:57,564
Nor two-gun shooters.

631
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:00,567
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

632
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:02,235
Yeah, I was there.

633
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,281
First off...

634
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:10,702
...Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

635
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,954
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

636
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:17,751
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

637
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:19,961
It was because his dick...

638
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:23,673
...was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

639
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:30,931
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

640
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:36,728
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what...

641
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:40,482
...Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

642
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:44,903
That bullet whizzing by panicked Corky.
He did the wrong thing.

643
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,989
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

644
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,826
Meantime, Bob here...

645
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,413
...aims real good
and squeezes off another...

646
00:56:54,663 --> 00:56:59,626
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1000 mirror over the bar.

647
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:05,632
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

648
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,009
He aims real careful.

649
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,262
- No hurry.
- And?

650
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,013
Bam!

651
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:18,145
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

652
00:57:18,854 --> 00:57:24,025
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there...

653
00:57:24,276 --> 00:57:26,945
...to defend himself to the end.

654
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:28,655
Wait a minute.

655
00:57:29,698 --> 00:57:33,535
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

656
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:37,706
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

657
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:41,710
No, he just
walked over there real slow...

658
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:44,546
...because he was drunk...

659
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,841
...and shot him
through the liver.

660
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:11,406
Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

661
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:15,577
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

662
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:20,081
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

663
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,711
You'll miss your dadgum
roof next, I suppose.

664
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:27,797
Shit!

665
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:41,853
Say, Will?
Hm?

666
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:46,900
That business up in Jackson County,
that really happen?

667
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:50,820
- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

668
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:57,327
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

669
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,329
Got you dead to rights.

670
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:03,124
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

671
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:06,545
Only took a scratch yourself.

672
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:14,386
Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it...

673
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:17,222
...shooting your way out
of that scrape.

674
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:23,478
Yeah. I don't recollect.

675
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,650
You don't recollect?

676
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,444
That's right.

677
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,364
Ned...

678
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:39,661
...how many men you killed?

679
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:45,125
Ain't you gonna answer?

680
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,670
What the hell's that to you?

681
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:56,428
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

682
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,309
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

683
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,352
How many?

684
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:08,148
Five!

685
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,525
I done killed five of them.

686
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,905
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

687
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:18,366
Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

688
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,537
You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

689
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:30,837
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

690
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,881
Than English Bob?

691
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:35,717
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

692
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:39,554
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

693
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,890
He would've killed old Bob.

694
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:44,434
Look, son.

695
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:48,313
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

696
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:53,401
...don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

697
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:57,739
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

698
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,741
...like as not he'll kill you.

699
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:04,663
- But if the other fellow is quicker...
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

700
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,081
Look here.

701
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:14,089
That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.

702
01:01:14,506 --> 01:01:16,174
Unless it's a barn.

703
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,551
But if he doesn't miss?

704
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:21,596
He'll kill you.

705
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:29,688
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

706
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:32,107
Like me.

707
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,361
It ain't so easy to shoot a man
if he's shooting back.

708
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:40,448
- That'll flat rattle some folks.
- Yeah.

709
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,575
- Let me show you something.
- Just a minute.

710
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,619
Look here.
- I know. Just...

711
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,454
Take that.

712
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:50,291
Go on, take it.

713
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,214
There's the key.

714
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:59,300
Just shoot me...

715
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:04,139
...and you and Bob can
ride on out of here free as birds.

716
01:02:08,977 --> 01:02:13,022
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

717
01:02:13,273 --> 01:02:15,108
First, you got to cock it.

718
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,575
Go on, cock it.

719
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,835
Now you got to point it.

720
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,548
Go on. Point it.

721
01:02:48,016 --> 01:02:51,644
Now all you got to do
is pull the trigger.

722
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,452
Hot, ain't it?

723
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:12,373
Didn't even put your finger
on the trigger.

724
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,209
What if...?

725
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:18,087
What if I gave it to him?

726
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:19,839
Give it to him.

727
01:03:28,348 --> 01:03:32,060
- You don't really want me to...
- Give it to him.

728
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:34,789
I guess he don't want it.

729
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,813
You were right not to take it.

730
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,481
I'd have killed you.

731
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:21,669
We could use some rain.

732
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:35,016
You no-good, goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

733
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:38,436
Sorry, old horse.

734
01:05:49,656 --> 01:05:52,617
I brung this
for when we kill them fellows.

735
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,036
Figured we could use some now.

736
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,538
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

737
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:01,000
- Come on, it's raining.
- I know it's raining!

738
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,252
Give some to the Kid.

739
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:09,801
You think that Kid
really killed five men?

740
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:11,552
No.

741
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:20,728
When he talked about the time
them deputies had the drop on you...

742
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:22,855
Yeah?

743
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:27,193
I remember
there was three men you shot, not two.

744
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,862
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

745
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,573
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

746
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:38,579
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

747
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,582
If we don't drown first.

748
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,011
Give these keys to the conductor.

749
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:56,889
He can loose Bob's cuffs
as soon as he's outside the county.

750
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,601
- Yeah.
- Got my pistols?

751
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:04,897
I guess you know, Bob...

752
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:10,278
...that if I see you again
I'll just shoot in self-defense.

753
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:18,703
I didn't steal your biographer!

754
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,956
He's staying on his own account!

755
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:25,334
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

756
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:28,588
The plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

757
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,965
Without morals or laws!

758
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:35,386
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

759
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:39,390
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

760
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,477
Because they wouldn't have you
in England!

761
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:45,438
You're a lot of savages!

762
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:49,484
You're all a bunch of bloody savages!
A curse on you!

763
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:51,486
I'll be back!

764
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,988
- Nobody's going to come...
- Huh?

765
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:58,618
...after what Little Bill done
to that Englishman.

766
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:02,163
Delilah, can't you
get them tables clean?

767
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:07,335
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

768
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:12,006
- What do they call that face cover?
- A veil.

769
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:14,133
Yeah. Get a veil!

770
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,353
Rain's coming.

771
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,605
Thank God.

772
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:50,211
Will?

773
01:08:52,922 --> 01:08:54,340
You sure?

774
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:08,020
You all right, Will?

775
01:09:17,864 --> 01:09:19,991
Fellow asking for you.

776
01:09:20,575 --> 01:09:22,952
Tonight?
You ain't joshing?

777
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,204
This way, mister.

778
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,541
Must be randy as hell
to come out in this shit.

779
01:09:38,718 --> 01:09:41,721
"No, no!
You're wrong, Little Bill!" he said.

780
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:45,266
"That's not a Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

781
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:48,394
He had changed it over.
And I said to him:

782
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:51,731
"Jim, you're a liar
and a horse thief!"

783
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:58,112
When he saw nobody would help him,
he started crying...

784
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:00,948
...and sobbing
and just carrying on.

785
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,911
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!"

786
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,622
So I said, "Jim, it makes me sick..."

787
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:10,583
- Open the window, will you?
- Yeah.

788
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:15,087
"...to see a man carrying
two pistols and a Henry rifle...

789
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:17,632
...and crying like a damn baby."

790
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,301
So you killed him?
- No.

791
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:22,303
But I should have.

792
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,264
I can't abide them kind.

793
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:27,600
You see them in the taverns.

794
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:30,144
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

795
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:32,480
- Crazed miners.
- Yeah.

796
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:36,651
Sporting their pistols and
acting like they was bad men.

797
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:41,030
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

798
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:48,287
- I do not like assassins.
- Assassins.

799
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:50,957
Or men of low character.

800
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:54,502
- Like your friend, English Bob.
- Uh-huh.

801
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:56,671
- But, now Bob was no coward.
- No.

802
01:10:56,921 --> 01:11:00,132
He wouldn't cry
and carry on like that...

803
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:03,678
Sheriff... I just...

804
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:06,514
I don't have any more receptacles.

805
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:09,767
Maybe you should hang the carpenter.

806
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:12,353
What?

807
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:14,522
Oh, uh...

808
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:19,110
I was just saying because of the...
You hang...

809
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,195
Doesn't matter.

810
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:25,449
What the hell?

811
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:27,868
On a night like this!

812
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:33,207
- Who the hell is it?
Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

813
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,669
What?

814
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:41,299
Three fellows just come into town.
They're down to Greely's.

815
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,884
At least two of them got guns.

816
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:54,145
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

817
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:57,732
You don't suppose he's up...

818
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:00,693
Jesus, Will!

819
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:02,403
You look like shit.

820
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:09,744
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

821
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:12,496
Yeah.

822
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,000
I saw him.

823
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:18,919
Will, he's dead.

824
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:21,672
No, I saw him, Ned.

825
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:26,177
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

826
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,681
Jesus! You got a fever.

827
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:34,268
- Take a drink, will you?
- Worms were coming out.

828
01:12:37,355 --> 01:12:40,441
Look, I'm going up
to see what's keeping the Kid.

829
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:45,237
Must be getting an advance
from one of the sporting ladies.

830
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:48,949
If I was to...

831
01:12:50,868 --> 01:12:56,457
If it worked out that I could take
a little time for myself...

832
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,752
I mean you wouldn't...

833
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:05,591
I guess you wouldn't want to come.

834
01:14:27,173 --> 01:14:28,883
Give me the pistol.

835
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:38,392
I says give me over your pistol.

836
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:42,229
I ain't drunk.

837
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:48,819
Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to my office...

838
01:14:48,986 --> 01:14:50,237
...day or night.

839
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:02,249
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

840
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,584
No.

841
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:06,420
But I ain't...

842
01:15:07,213 --> 01:15:08,714
I ain't armed.

843
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:13,928
What about your friends upstairs?
They got any pistols?

844
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:20,017
They ain't armed either.

845
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:23,437
Spilled your whiskey.

846
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,941
- I said...
What's your name?

847
01:15:28,817 --> 01:15:30,110
- William...
William?

848
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:33,948
...Hendershot.

849
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:40,120
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

850
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:47,378
...what if I was to say you was
a no-good son of a bitch and a liar?

851
01:15:48,963 --> 01:15:54,134
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul...

852
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:59,473
...I bet you'd show me that pistol
quick and kill me. Isn't that so?

853
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,399
Maybe, yeah, I guess.

854
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:11,485
But the fact is...

855
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:15,281
...I ain't carrying no firearm.

856
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:16,991
Get up.

857
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,931
Come on.

858
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,192
What's this for,
snakes and such?

859
01:16:53,152 --> 01:16:54,194
Yeah.

860
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:58,365
We don't have any snakes in here,
Mr. Hendershot.

861
01:16:58,866 --> 01:17:00,326
Well...

862
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:07,041
It ain't loaded or...
Powder's wet.

863
01:17:10,336 --> 01:17:11,920
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

864
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:17,718
This is the trash
I was speaking of!

865
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:29,313
They're in all the saloons
in all your prosperous communities!

866
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,564
Wichita!

867
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,694
Over in Cheyenne!

868
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:40,157
Abilene!

869
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:47,748
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

870
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:54,004
Hurry up!
You know what to tell Bill.

871
01:17:54,254 --> 01:17:58,092
Look for that lone pine.
Miss the pine, you won't find it.

872
01:17:58,342 --> 01:18:00,469
Forget the shirt!
Put the boots on!

873
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:14,358
What'll we do about Will?
Come on, Kid!

874
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:17,861
Let's hope them horses are still there!

875
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,313
Let the man out, W.W.

876
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:58,318
He's desiring to leave the hospitality
of Big Whiskey behind him.

877
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,686
Easy!

878
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:37,441
- She's got to turn a dollar a time.
- Why'd they lit out the back window?

879
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:40,194
They seen you beating on their friend.

880
01:19:41,195 --> 01:19:45,783
- They come for the billiards, honest.
Billiards?!

881
01:19:46,492 --> 01:19:50,370
- They were just passing through?
- They was going to Fort Buford.

882
01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:53,582
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

883
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,542
Innocent?

884
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,211
Innocent of what?

885
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:19,233
Ah, Jesus.

886
01:20:24,613 --> 01:20:28,408
Jesus, Ned! You done this before?

887
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,161
Plenty of times.

888
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:35,040
His pistol must've jammed.

889
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:41,046
Here. Bring that candle in closer.
I can't see.

890
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:56,603
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

891
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:59,565
He wouldn't give it over
and not shoot.

892
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,195
He don't look so good.

893
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:09,199
He didn't even pull his pistol?

894
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:13,203
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
I'd have pulled my pistol.

895
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:16,456
You did!
Out of the lady and out the window!

896
01:21:16,707 --> 01:21:19,710
- That was your idea! I...
- We got to go.

897
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:23,088
What? I'm ready for another advance.

898
01:21:23,297 --> 01:21:26,925
You'll use it all up.
No more advances.

899
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:31,805
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

900
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:35,684
We're going to need more food!
About three days' worth.

901
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:37,644
Three days?

902
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:40,272
We can kill them tomorrow.

903
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,651
- I don't kill nobody without him.
- We don't need him! We can do it.

904
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:46,236
Besides...

905
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:49,823
...he ain't nothing
but a broken-down pig farmer.

906
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,201
We'll bring food in the morning,
and some whiskey too!

907
01:21:53,452 --> 01:21:55,662
And some medicine if you got any!

908
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,666
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

909
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,460
Don't you ladies worry!

910
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:07,257
Me and Ned, we'll kill them two
sons of bitches for you!

911
01:22:13,013 --> 01:22:14,473
Claudia.

912
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:22,356
Will?

913
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:26,318
- Claudia's not here.
- Is that you, Ned?

914
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,613
I seen him.

915
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,952
I seen the Angel of Death.

916
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:38,038
I seen a river, Ned.

917
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,293
- He's got snake eyes.
- Who's got snake eyes?

918
01:22:43,752 --> 01:22:45,545
It's the Angel of Death.

919
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,716
Oh, Ned. Oh, Ned.

920
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,760
I'm scared of dying.

921
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:54,179
Easy, partner.

922
01:22:54,805 --> 01:22:56,682
I seen Claudia too.

923
01:22:57,557 --> 01:23:00,811
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

924
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,897
Her face was all covered with worms.

925
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,358
Ned, I'm scared.

926
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:09,027
I'm dying.

927
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:16,034
You won't...
No, don't tell nobody.

928
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:18,412
Don't tell my kids...

929
01:23:18,996 --> 01:23:22,833
...none of the things I done.
You hear me?

930
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:24,918
All right, Will.

931
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:44,229
He's gonna die, ain't he?

932
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:47,107
Maybe.

933
01:23:47,524 --> 01:23:49,693
Supposing he does?

934
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:54,865
We'll bury him.

935
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:56,950
That ain't what I mean.

936
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:04,291
You mean, will I help
you kill them cowboys?

937
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,377
I can't spot them myself.

938
01:24:07,836 --> 01:24:09,337
But you could.

939
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:14,051
That big bastard, you could spot him
a half-mile off, I bet.

940
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,137
And if I spot him?

941
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:20,891
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

942
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:25,103
Just like that?

943
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:28,148
I'm a damn killer.
I done it before.

944
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:33,403
I'm more of a killer than he is.

945
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:36,823
Yeah?

946
01:24:39,493 --> 01:24:40,744
Yeah.

947
01:25:03,183 --> 01:25:06,269
I thought you was an angel.

948
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,688
You ain't dead.

949
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:18,615
Some big fellow...

950
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:21,827
...kicked the hell out of me.

951
01:25:24,704 --> 01:25:26,957
I must look like you now.

952
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,294
You don't look nothing like me.

953
01:25:33,213 --> 01:25:34,840
No offense meant.

954
01:25:37,676 --> 01:25:41,012
You got to be the one
those cowboys cut up.

955
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,688
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

956
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:51,940
...they around?

957
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:55,819
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

958
01:25:56,736 --> 01:25:57,863
Scouting?

959
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,699
Out to the Bar T...

960
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,993
...looking for them.

961
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,874
How long I been here?

962
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,501
Three days.

963
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,713
Are you hungry or...?

964
01:26:15,422 --> 01:26:17,215
Three days?

965
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:19,009
I ought to be...

966
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:33,690
I thought I was gone.

967
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:40,405
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this...

968
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:43,783
...trees,
but I'm sure noticing now.

969
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:47,287
Thought I was dying for sure.

970
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:50,749
I brought your hat.

971
01:26:51,082 --> 01:26:53,627
You left it down at Greely's.

972
01:26:54,294 --> 01:26:55,629
Thanks.

973
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:58,882
That sheriff...

974
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:02,886
- He still looking for me?
- Little Bill?

975
01:27:03,136 --> 01:27:05,889
No, he thinks you went south.

976
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:12,020
Are you really gonna
kill them cowboys?

977
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:14,439
I guess.

978
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,734
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

979
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:22,072
Them other two, your friends...

980
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:25,659
...they been taking
advances on the payment.

981
01:27:26,493 --> 01:27:27,911
Advances?

982
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:32,958
- Free ones.
- Free ones?

983
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,753
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

984
01:27:38,672 --> 01:27:39,923
I see.

985
01:27:43,677 --> 01:27:45,762
Would you like a free one?

986
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,315
No. I guess not.

987
01:27:58,108 --> 01:28:01,778
I didn't mean with me.
I meant...

988
01:28:02,028 --> 01:28:06,700
...Alice and Silky would be happy
to give you a free one if you wanted.

989
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:09,119
That's all I meant.

990
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:12,872
I didn't mean...

991
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:17,210
...I didn't want a free one
because you been cut up and all.

992
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:21,965
What I said about you looking like me,
that ain't true.

993
01:28:22,549 --> 01:28:24,384
You ain't ugly like me.

994
01:28:25,844 --> 01:28:29,347
It's just that we both got scars.

995
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:35,020
You're a beautiful woman,
and if I wanted a free one...

996
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:38,898
...I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

997
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,652
It's just that...

998
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:45,822
...I can't on account of my wife.

999
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:53,663
Your wife?

1000
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:58,043
Yeah. You see?

1001
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,591
I admire you for that.

1002
01:29:05,258 --> 01:29:07,719
For being true to your wife.

1003
01:29:08,762 --> 01:29:10,889
I've known a lot of men...

1004
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:14,559
...who weren't.

1005
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,396
I suppose.

1006
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:26,696
Is she back in Kansas?

1007
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:29,866
Yeah.

1008
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:33,578
She's watching over my young ones.

1009
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,920
Hang on!
Get the damn iron!

1010
01:29:42,921 --> 01:29:46,299
Davey! Davey!

1011
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:53,473
Jesus, fellas!

1012
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,612
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

1013
01:30:09,656 --> 01:30:11,241
I'm pinned, boys!

1014
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:14,285
Better finish him, Ned.

1015
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:16,830
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

1016
01:30:17,122 --> 01:30:18,998
He got the boy's horse.

1017
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:22,085
Finish him before he gets clear.

1018
01:30:24,838 --> 01:30:26,756
Get behind them rocks.

1019
01:30:27,507 --> 01:30:28,800
Get over there!

1020
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:34,806
- What happened? He ain't killed?!
Hurry up, Davey!

1021
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:36,307
What's going on?

1022
01:30:36,683 --> 01:30:39,144
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

1023
01:30:39,519 --> 01:30:41,980
- Unless we go down there.
What rocks?

1024
01:30:42,355 --> 01:30:45,150
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

1025
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:51,156
Shoot!

1026
01:30:55,368 --> 01:30:59,247
- Will...
You backshooting bastards!

1027
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:07,130
I ain't very good with one of these.

1028
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,180
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

1029
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,725
Did you get him?

1030
01:31:19,559 --> 01:31:20,810
Where is he?

1031
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,313
How many more shots do I have?

1032
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:28,151
How many more shots do I have?

1033
01:31:31,696 --> 01:31:34,991
- Two.
- Two.

1034
01:31:35,158 --> 01:31:36,367
Bastards!

1035
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:46,002
- Go, Davey!
- Did you get him?

1036
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:05,230
Here, reload this.

1037
01:32:05,522 --> 01:32:06,564
Slim.

1038
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,733
- You missed him.
- I got him.

1039
01:32:09,776 --> 01:32:12,612
They shot me, boys.

1040
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:14,614
- He ain't killed.
They shot me.

1041
01:32:14,781 --> 01:32:16,533
Maybe, maybe not.

1042
01:32:17,116 --> 01:32:19,369
Got him through the gut, I think.

1043
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:25,416
Think he'll die?

1044
01:32:27,835 --> 01:32:30,421
You think we killed him?

1045
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:34,467
They shot me, boys.

1046
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,596
Yeah.

1047
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:43,142
We killed him, I guess.

1048
01:32:46,813 --> 01:32:48,731
I'm dying, boys!

1049
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,069
Then you shouldn't have out up
no woman, you asshole!

1050
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:01,369
Jesus, I'm so thirsty!

1051
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:07,417
Give me some water, please!

1052
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:09,168
Please, Slim!

1053
01:33:10,336 --> 01:33:11,963
I'm bleeding, Slim!

1054
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,009
Drink of water, please.

1055
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:18,928
Give him a drink of water,
goddamn it!

1056
01:33:21,014 --> 01:33:22,849
Give me a drink of water, Slim!

1057
01:33:23,016 --> 01:33:27,103
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't gonna shoot!

1058
01:33:29,147 --> 01:33:32,400
- You ain't gonna shoot?
- No.

1059
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:36,279
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1060
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,990
Here I come now!

1061
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:47,498
Don't shoot me, you bastards!

1062
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,337
Davey. Shit!

1063
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:01,429
Davey!

1064
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,848
They take him water?

1065
01:34:05,016 --> 01:34:06,392
Yeah.

1066
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:08,853
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1067
01:34:09,062 --> 01:34:10,688
Hold on now!

1068
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:17,236
No!

1069
01:34:19,447 --> 01:34:22,992
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1070
01:34:31,918 --> 01:34:33,753
When will we double back?

1071
01:34:34,462 --> 01:34:36,214
After a ways.

1072
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:38,841
Not me.

1073
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:44,931
- I'm heading back down to Kansas.
- We got to kill the other one first.

1074
01:34:45,098 --> 01:34:49,227
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1075
01:34:49,394 --> 01:34:53,272
We'll shoot him
and head back with the money.

1076
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,610
- Do you want the Spencer?
- It's no time to quit.

1077
01:34:57,902 --> 01:35:00,363
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

1078
01:35:00,613 --> 01:35:03,366
I'll see you, Will.
So long, Kid.

1079
01:35:05,368 --> 01:35:06,703
Ned.

1080
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:15,420
Here. I ain't no good
with that damn thing.

1081
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,633
Me and the Kid'll head over
to that ranch and we'll shoot him.

1082
01:35:21,092 --> 01:35:24,971
We'll meet up with you,
get our money, and go back together.

1083
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:28,057
Suppose he don't go back
to the ranch?

1084
01:35:28,433 --> 01:35:32,437
He ain't going into town
or stay out in the open country.

1085
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:34,731
He'll hole up at that ranch.

1086
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:38,067
I ain't waiting.

1087
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:41,195
I'll look in on your young ones.

1088
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:46,075
Hey, Ned.

1089
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:50,955
Forget what the Kid said
about the money.

1090
01:35:51,164 --> 01:35:53,708
I'll bring your share.

1091
01:35:56,502 --> 01:35:58,087
Kid's full of shit.

1092
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:20,485
Little Bill? Little Bill?

1093
01:36:26,282 --> 01:36:28,493
Just doing some repairs up here.

1094
01:36:28,868 --> 01:36:30,703
They killed one of them cowboys.

1095
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,042
Shit!

1096
01:36:37,543 --> 01:36:42,089
Parson said he saw three men,
right after sunup, headed east.

1097
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:46,803
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten gray.

1098
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:51,641
He didn't know what the third one
was on, maybe an appaloosa.

1099
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:55,978
Amos says to ask if the county
will pay for feed for all the horses.

1100
01:36:56,229 --> 01:36:59,524
Witherspoon won't sell us
no more shells without pay.

1101
01:36:59,774 --> 01:37:01,400
Hell, use my dogs!

1102
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:03,903
Then the county's got
to be responsible.

1103
01:37:04,779 --> 01:37:09,325
Get on out there to the Bar T
and make sure that other cowboy...

1104
01:37:09,575 --> 01:37:11,327
...stays put
and don't expose himself.

1105
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:12,662
All right.

1106
01:37:22,171 --> 01:37:24,507
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1107
01:37:25,132 --> 01:37:28,010
Think they come up
from Kansas to fuck us?

1108
01:37:29,512 --> 01:37:34,767
That Kid, he's just a boy
and the other one...

1109
01:37:35,017 --> 01:37:37,895
...Will, the nice one,
being so true to his wife...

1110
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:40,690
Wife?
He ain't got no wife.

1111
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:44,026
- Yes, he does. He...
- He ain't got no wife.

1112
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:46,362
Not above ground, anyways.

1113
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:53,870
Murdering whores!

1114
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:58,457
He had it coming!
He had it coming for what he done!

1115
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:02,628
And the other one too!
Both of them for what they done!

1116
01:38:08,259 --> 01:38:11,012
We got one!
They got one.

1117
01:38:11,178 --> 01:38:14,223
We got one!

1118
01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:19,312
We got one, sheriff!
Out by Cow Creek!

1119
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:22,023
- Is he alive?
- Hell, yeah!

1120
01:38:22,273 --> 01:38:26,903
Bunch of us from Bar T went looking
because they killed one of our own.

1121
01:38:27,236 --> 01:38:30,406
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

1122
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,991
He admit it?

1123
01:38:32,325 --> 01:38:36,412
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1124
01:38:37,163 --> 01:38:38,664
They messing him up?

1125
01:38:40,249 --> 01:38:41,751
Little bit.

1126
01:38:43,461 --> 01:38:45,254
Clyde, Andy.

1127
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:49,425
Get out there. Find out
what happened to those other two!

1128
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:14,700
See anything out there, Buck?

1129
01:39:14,951 --> 01:39:18,788
Hell, yes!
Seen about 200 fellows packing rifles.

1130
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:23,334
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1131
01:39:23,584 --> 01:39:26,879
I said, "How much?" They says, "Five."
I said, "Dollars?"

1132
01:39:27,129 --> 01:39:28,381
They said, "Cents."

1133
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:30,132
I said, "Sold."

1134
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:33,469
Well, I ain't worried!

1135
01:39:33,803 --> 01:39:37,306
Because I got me some protection.

1136
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:04,125
Tell you where them is?
- Nope.

1137
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:08,087
Any names?
- Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

1138
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:14,176
Bring him in. So Ned...

1139
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:18,597
...you'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

1140
01:40:18,764 --> 01:40:20,975
...all about your two friends.

1141
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:26,731
I'll want the names and
whereabouts of those son of a bitches.

1142
01:40:40,411 --> 01:40:42,038
Sure is ripe.

1143
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,541
Yeah. Going to get a lot riper.

1144
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:48,544
Think he's still in there?

1145
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:51,797
He's in there.

1146
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:56,469
He's holding on to his shit
like it was money.

1147
01:40:56,635 --> 01:40:58,054
He's in there.

1148
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:02,975
- Tell me right off if you see him.
- Yeah.

1149
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,561
You won't shoot him your own self?

1150
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:08,439
You can shoot him.

1151
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:48,104
Now you and Mr. Quincy and...

1152
01:41:48,354 --> 01:41:50,815
What was the young fellow's name?

1153
01:41:52,942 --> 01:41:56,153
Elroy Tate.

1154
01:42:01,033 --> 01:42:03,369
No, that's not what you said.

1155
01:42:03,828 --> 01:42:06,789
- Hell if it ain't!
- No, you said:

1156
01:42:07,373 --> 01:42:10,126
"Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat...

1157
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:14,630
...and Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

1158
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:16,549
Hell if I did.

1159
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:20,845
- Hell if I did.
- Charley?

1160
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:24,515
Go get them whores that
pumped these boys that night.

1161
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:26,809
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1162
01:42:27,143 --> 01:42:30,688
Go on and get them!

1163
01:42:34,608 --> 01:42:36,527
Now, Ned.

1164
01:42:37,862 --> 01:42:42,074
Them whores are going to tell
different lies than you.

1165
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:48,122
And when their lies
ain't the same as your lies...

1166
01:42:48,831 --> 01:42:51,041
Well, I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1167
01:42:52,168 --> 01:42:54,128
But I'm going to hurt you.

1168
01:42:56,589 --> 01:42:58,757
Not gentle like before...

1169
01:43:00,301 --> 01:43:02,052
...but bad.

1170
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:19,778
Where you going?

1171
01:43:19,945 --> 01:43:22,114
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish.

1172
01:43:22,448 --> 01:43:24,700
To protect me while I take a dump?

1173
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:27,119
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1174
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:30,539
I'll go.
- Yeah, you can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1175
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:34,668
Hell with him. He ain't polite,
he should get shot.

1176
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:39,465
Is that him?

1177
01:43:39,715 --> 01:43:41,342
Yeah, that's him.

1178
01:43:45,137 --> 01:43:49,016
All right, Kid. Go get him.
He's all yours.

1179
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:25,636
Assassins!

1180
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,016
Shoot him!

1181
01:44:34,144 --> 01:44:35,312
No.

1182
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:37,439
No, no!

1183
01:44:46,657 --> 01:44:48,200
Come on, goddamn it!

1184
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:08,262
- Did you get him?
- Yeah.

1185
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:20,691
Cover me.

1186
01:45:23,235 --> 01:45:25,612
- I can't see them!
Just shoot!

1187
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:05,277
Was it like that in the old days?

1188
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,489
Everybody riding out, shooting...

1189
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:12,868
...smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

1190
01:46:14,703 --> 01:46:16,038
I guess so.

1191
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,628
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

1192
01:46:23,796 --> 01:46:25,798
I was even scared a little.

1193
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:27,383
For a minute.

1194
01:46:30,135 --> 01:46:32,137
You ever scared in them days?

1195
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,808
I can't remember.

1196
01:46:37,142 --> 01:46:40,187
I was drunk most of the time.

1197
01:46:46,068 --> 01:46:48,654
I shot that fucker three times!

1198
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:54,076
He was taking a shit,
went for his pistol and I blazed away.

1199
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:55,619
First shot...

1200
01:46:57,413 --> 01:46:59,623
...I got him right in the chest.

1201
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:06,380
Say, Will?
- Yeah?

1202
01:47:08,841 --> 01:47:10,426
That was the first one.

1203
01:47:11,844 --> 01:47:13,220
First one what?

1204
01:47:15,597 --> 01:47:17,433
First one I ever killed.

1205
01:47:18,976 --> 01:47:20,060
Yeah?

1206
01:47:21,437 --> 01:47:23,856
You know how I said I shot five men?

1207
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,859
It weren't true.

1208
01:47:29,278 --> 01:47:32,573
That Mexican with the knife?

1209
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:37,119
I just busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing.

1210
01:47:40,414 --> 01:47:43,750
You sure killed
the hell out of that fellow today.

1211
01:47:45,586 --> 01:47:47,171
Hell, yeah!

1212
01:47:50,632 --> 01:47:53,635
Killed the hell out of him, didn't I?

1213
01:47:53,886 --> 01:47:56,930
Three shots and he was taking a shit.

1214
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:04,855
Take a drink, Kid.

1215
01:48:15,741 --> 01:48:17,618
Jesus Christ!

1216
01:48:30,088 --> 01:48:31,965
It don't seem real.

1217
01:48:33,509 --> 01:48:36,637
How he ain't gonna
never breath again, ever.

1218
01:48:37,596 --> 01:48:38,931
How he's dead.

1219
01:48:40,766 --> 01:48:43,352
And the other one too.

1220
01:48:45,145 --> 01:48:48,440
On account of pulling a trigger.

1221
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:53,654
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

1222
01:48:54,863 --> 01:48:57,699
You take away all he's got...

1223
01:48:57,866 --> 01:49:00,077
...and all he's ever gonna have.

1224
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:07,543
I guess they had it coming.

1225
01:49:13,549 --> 01:49:15,801
We all have it coming, Kid.

1226
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:33,318
I was watching
that you weren't followed.

1227
01:49:34,736 --> 01:49:39,950
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

1228
01:49:44,538 --> 01:49:49,209
You want to help me count this?
- I trust you.

1229
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:51,878
Don't go trusting me too much.

1230
01:49:52,754 --> 01:49:56,091
In fact, we'll give Ned his share together.

1231
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:58,969
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

1232
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:00,596
Ned's share?

1233
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:05,601
He went south.
We'll catch up.

1234
01:50:06,351 --> 01:50:08,145
He's dead.

1235
01:50:11,523 --> 01:50:14,109
What do you mean, dead?

1236
01:50:14,276 --> 01:50:17,070
He went south yesterday.
He ain't dead.

1237
01:50:17,613 --> 01:50:20,198
They killed him.
I thought you knew.

1238
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:22,367
Nobody killed Ned!

1239
01:50:22,618 --> 01:50:25,329
He didn't kill anyone.
He went south!

1240
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:27,581
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1241
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:31,418
Who killed him?

1242
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:33,462
Little Bill.

1243
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:36,298
The Bar T boys caught him...

1244
01:50:36,673 --> 01:50:38,717
...and Little Bill beat him up.

1245
01:50:38,884 --> 01:50:43,805
He was making him answer questions,
beating him up. Then Ned just died.

1246
01:50:44,139 --> 01:50:46,683
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1247
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:48,310
A sign on him?

1248
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:50,646
In front of Greely's.

1249
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:53,231
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1250
01:50:57,653 --> 01:51:00,947
These questions he was asking...

1251
01:51:01,114 --> 01:51:03,367
...what kind were they?

1252
01:51:03,533 --> 01:51:09,498
About where you and him was.

1253
01:51:09,915 --> 01:51:11,166
Then what?

1254
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:16,588
A cowboy come in saying
you killed Quick Mike in the shithouse.

1255
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:20,467
So Little Bill killed him
for what we done?

1256
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,094
Not on purpose.

1257
01:51:23,011 --> 01:51:27,015
But he started hurting him worse.
Making him tell stuff.

1258
01:51:27,349 --> 01:51:28,892
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

1259
01:51:29,685 --> 01:51:34,564
Then Little Bill hurt him so bad,
he said who you was.

1260
01:51:35,524 --> 01:51:39,653
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1261
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:42,823
Little Bill said, "The one
who dynamited...

1262
01:51:43,073 --> 01:51:46,410
...the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

1263
01:51:46,576 --> 01:51:49,705
Ned said you done a lot worse.
Said you was...

1264
01:51:49,955 --> 01:51:53,625
...more cold-blooded than Will Bonney.
Said if he hurt Ned again...

1265
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:59,047
...you'd come kill him
like you killed the U.S. marshal in '70.

1266
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:06,930
That didn't scare him, did it?

1267
01:52:07,889 --> 01:52:09,516
No, sir.

1268
01:52:17,149 --> 01:52:18,984
Give me your Schofield.

1269
01:52:19,234 --> 01:52:20,652
What for, Will?

1270
01:52:20,819 --> 01:52:24,698
- Give it to me.
- Yeah. Sure.

1271
01:52:29,286 --> 01:52:31,079
You want it, keep it.

1272
01:52:31,329 --> 01:52:32,706
I won't use it.

1273
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:37,377
I won't kill nobody no more.

1274
01:52:40,964 --> 01:52:42,591
I ain't like you, Will.

1275
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:49,765
You better ride on back, miss.

1276
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:55,896
Go on, keep all of it.
It's yours.

1277
01:52:56,772 --> 01:52:59,649
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

1278
01:53:00,734 --> 01:53:03,737
I'd rather be blind and ragged
than dead.

1279
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:09,075
You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.

1280
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:11,661
You're the only friend I got.

1281
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:24,132
Take this money and give my half
and Ned's half to my kids.

1282
01:53:24,716 --> 01:53:28,261
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally.

1283
01:53:28,512 --> 01:53:31,223
You keep the rest.
Get them spectacles.

1284
01:53:31,473 --> 01:53:33,225
You'll go kill Little Bill?

1285
01:53:33,683 --> 01:53:37,771
Stay clear of folks you see.
There'll be a lot out to hang you.

1286
01:53:38,355 --> 01:53:39,648
Get going.

1287
01:54:23,441 --> 01:54:27,696
I'll say this just one more time,
so don't ask me again!

1288
01:54:27,863 --> 01:54:31,908
Those on today's posse got one drink
coming from the county budget!

1289
01:54:34,494 --> 01:54:37,789
And those who rode yesterday
get one for that too.

1290
01:54:39,082 --> 01:54:40,625
Hold it!

1291
01:54:40,876 --> 01:54:45,338
That's two! After that, it comes
out of your own pocket! You hear?

1292
01:54:45,589 --> 01:54:48,633
Yes, sir.
- We'll pull out early in the morning.

1293
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:53,430
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

1294
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:57,017
We'll divide up into four parties!

1295
01:54:57,267 --> 01:55:01,229
We'll hit all the farms and trails
in a big circle.

1296
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:05,817
We're bound to find somebody
who's seen these skunks.

1297
01:55:23,251 --> 01:55:25,503
Who owns this shithole?

1298
01:55:35,013 --> 01:55:38,391
You, fat man. Speak up.

1299
01:55:41,019 --> 01:55:43,480
I own this establishment.

1300
01:55:45,941 --> 01:55:49,611
I bought it from Greely for $1000.

1301
01:55:51,029 --> 01:55:54,824
- Better clear out.
Yes, sir.

1302
01:55:55,617 --> 01:55:57,118
Hold it!

1303
01:55:57,285 --> 01:55:58,578
Hold it!

1304
01:56:07,796 --> 01:56:10,882
Sir, you are
a cowardly son of a bitch!

1305
01:56:11,883 --> 01:56:13,843
You just shot an unarmed man.

1306
01:56:14,302 --> 01:56:16,346
He should've armed himself...

1307
01:56:16,596 --> 01:56:19,349
...if he's going to decorate his saloon
with my friend.

1308
01:56:20,058 --> 01:56:22,894
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

1309
01:56:23,061 --> 01:56:25,063
...killer of women and children.

1310
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,148
That's right.

1311
01:56:28,858 --> 01:56:30,819
I killed women and children.

1312
01:56:32,362 --> 01:56:36,241
Killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

1313
01:56:37,492 --> 01:56:40,161
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1314
01:56:40,996 --> 01:56:43,331
For what you did to Ned.

1315
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:49,421
You boys better move away.

1316
01:56:59,889 --> 01:57:04,060
All right, gentlemen.
He's got one barrel left.

1317
01:57:04,936 --> 01:57:07,105
When he fires it,
use your pistols...

1318
01:57:07,355 --> 01:57:11,609
...and shoot him down
like the mangy scoundrel he is!

1319
01:57:24,706 --> 01:57:27,167
Misfire! Kill the son of a bitch!

1320
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:53,359
Ah!

1321
01:58:03,995 --> 01:58:08,124
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1322
01:58:51,126 --> 01:58:54,462
I'm shot! I'm shot!

1323
01:58:54,963 --> 01:58:56,297
You ain't shot.

1324
01:58:59,259 --> 01:59:00,301
Please.

1325
01:59:02,345 --> 01:59:05,306
I don't have a gun.
I am not armed.

1326
01:59:06,724 --> 01:59:08,226
Pick up that rifle.

1327
01:59:10,228 --> 01:59:13,106
- Pick it up.
- I... I...

1328
01:59:13,857 --> 01:59:14,941
Shells too.

1329
01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:25,910
Oh, God.

1330
01:59:28,163 --> 01:59:29,622
You killed Little Bill.

1331
01:59:31,166 --> 01:59:32,667
Sure you ain't armed?

1332
01:59:35,086 --> 01:59:37,005
I'm not.
I don't have a gun.

1333
01:59:37,255 --> 01:59:39,966
I've never had a gun.
I'm a writer!

1334
01:59:41,426 --> 01:59:42,927
- A writer?
- Yeah.

1335
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,847
- Letters and such?
- Books.

1336
01:59:46,556 --> 01:59:48,099
- Books.
- Yeah.

1337
01:59:48,266 --> 01:59:52,187
I don't believe it, you killed
five men. Single-handed.

1338
01:59:53,855 --> 01:59:55,148
Yeah.

1339
01:59:58,193 --> 01:59:59,485
Uh...

1340
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:03,740
- That's a Spencer rifle, right?
- Right.

1341
02:00:10,371 --> 02:00:13,333
Who'd you kill first?

1342
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,043
Huh?

1343
02:00:17,253 --> 02:00:19,505
"When confronted by superior numbers...

1344
02:00:19,756 --> 02:00:23,009
...an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first."

1345
02:00:23,676 --> 02:00:25,720
- Is that so?
- Little Bill said that.

1346
02:00:25,887 --> 02:00:28,306
You probably killed him first.

1347
02:00:28,473 --> 02:00:30,516
I was lucky in the order.

1348
02:00:31,476 --> 02:00:35,480
I'm always lucky
when it comes to killing folks.

1349
02:00:36,356 --> 02:00:40,109
That so? Who was next?
Clyde, right?

1350
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,071
You killed Clyde,
or it was Deputy Andy...

1351
02:00:43,321 --> 02:00:45,949
All I can tell you is,
who'll be last.

1352
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:24,570
I don't deserve this.

1353
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:28,199
To die like this.

1354
02:01:31,035 --> 02:01:33,121
I was building a house.

1355
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:36,708
Deserve's got nothing to do with it.

1356
02:01:39,419 --> 02:01:42,839
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1357
02:01:49,262 --> 02:01:50,680
Yeah.

1358
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:24,297
All right, I'm coming out!

1359
02:02:24,714 --> 02:02:27,508
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

1360
02:02:28,092 --> 02:02:30,595
Anyone takes a shot at me...

1361
02:02:31,304 --> 02:02:36,142
...I'm not only going to kill him,
but his wife and all his friends.

1362
02:02:36,476 --> 02:02:38,728
And burn his damn house down!

1363
02:02:46,069 --> 02:02:47,862
Nobody better shoot!

1364
02:03:03,419 --> 02:03:05,505
Charley, go ahead.
Shoot him!

1365
02:03:19,644 --> 02:03:20,978
I can't.

1366
02:03:21,437 --> 02:03:24,232
Hell, no!
I ain't no deputy!

1367
02:03:44,127 --> 02:03:46,754
You better bury Ned right!

1368
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:51,050
You better not cut up
nor otherwise harm no whores!

1369
02:03:54,971 --> 02:03:59,350
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons of bitches.
