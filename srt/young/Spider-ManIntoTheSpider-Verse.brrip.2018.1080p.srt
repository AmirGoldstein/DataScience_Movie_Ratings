00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, let's do this one last time.</i></font>

2
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter Parker.</i></font>

3
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for 10 years, I've been the one...</i></font>

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and only...</i></font>

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...Spider-Man.</i></font>

7
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i></font>

8
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With great power comes
great responsibility.</font>

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.</i></font>

10
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then I saved the city again.
And again and again and again.</i></font>

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I did, uh...</i></font>

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I did this.</i></font>

13
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We don't really talk about this.</i></font>

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, I'm a comic book. I'm a cereal.</i></font>

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Did a Christmas album.</i></font>

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have an excellent theme song.</i></font>

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And a so-so popsicle.</i></font>

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, I've looked worse.</i></font>

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But after everything...</i></font>

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I still love being Spider-Man.</i></font>

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, who wouldn't?</i></font>

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So no matter how many hits I take...</i></font>

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I always find a way to come back.</i></font>

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion...</i></font>

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...is me.</i></font>

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's only one Spider-Man.</i></font>

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And you're lookin' at him.</i></font>

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, papa, time for school!</font>

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles!
- Yeah! Yeah?</font>

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you finished packing for school?</font>

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just ironing my last shirt.</font>

36
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! You a grown man now.
Let's show these teachers that.</font>

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles!</font>

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my laptop?</font>

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.</font>

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dad, I'll walk.</font>

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.</font>

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles! Gotta go.
- In a minute!</font>

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gotta go.
- In a minute!</font>

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, I gotta go.
- In a minute.</font>

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you Friday.</font>

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?</font>

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'?</font>

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Miles!
You feel that earthquake last night?</font>

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.</font>

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How's that new school?
- So easy.</font>

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We miss you, Miles.
- You miss me? I still live here!</font>

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you miss me?</font>

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Contra!</i></font>

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.</font>

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can walk plenty on Saturday
when you peel those stickers off.</font>

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw that? I don't know if that was me.</font>

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the two from yesterday on Clinton.</font>

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, those were me.</font>

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. Another new coffee shop.</font>

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.</font>

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.</font>

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Foam Party"? Come on.</font>

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?</font>

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see it.</font>

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that a coffee shop or a disco?
- Dad, you're old, man.</font>

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There are multiple reports of another
mysterious seismic event last night.</i></font>

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i></font>

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man.
I mean, this guy swings in once a day...</font>

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?</font>

71
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Dad. Yeah.</font>

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, my guys are out there...</font>

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...lives on the line, no masks.</font>

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.</font>

75
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With great ability comes
great accountability.</font>

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even how the saying goes.</font>

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.</font>

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh. Don't cops run red lights?</font>

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, some do. But not your dad.</font>

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I go back to Brooklyn Middle?</font>

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've given it 2 weeks.
We're not having this conversation.</font>

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just think that this new school is elitist.
- "Elitist"?</font>

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would prefer to be
at a normal school among the people.</font>

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The people"? These are your people.</font>

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only here
'cause I won that stupid lottery.</font>

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. You passed the entry test
just like everybody else.</font>

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?</font>

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna end up like your uncle?</font>

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.</font>

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all make choices in life.</font>

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.</font>

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't!</font>

93
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Miles.</font>

94
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday.</font>

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?</font>

96
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
- You wanna hear me say it?</font>

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're dropping me off at a school.
- "I love you, Dad."</font>

98
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at this place.
- "Dad, I love you."</font>

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, I love you.</font>

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a copy.</font>

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tie your shoes, please.</i></font>

102
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I love you, Dad."</font>

103
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, good morning. How you doin'?</font>

104
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weekend was short, huh?
- "That's a copy."</font>

105
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh! This is embarrassing.
We wore the same jacket.</font>

106
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Your shoe's untied.</font>

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm aware. It's a choice.</font>

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who can solve this for XY?</font>

109
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is known as a syllogism.</font>

110
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Read two chapters
of Great Expectations.</font>

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A take-home quiz on volumetric pressure.</font>

112
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5-page essay
with your conclusions stressed.</font>

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...countless other possibilities.</i></font>

114
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There could be a universe
where I am wearing red.</i></font>

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Or wearing leather pants.</i></font>

116
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.</font>

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Einstein said time was relative, right?</font>

118
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.</font>

119
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. It was just so quiet.</font>

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to keep standing there,
or do you wanna sit down?</font>

121
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our universe is, in fact,
one of many parallel universes...</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...happening at the exact same time.</i></font>

123
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thanks to everyone here
at the Fisk Family Foundation...</i></font>

124
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I liked your joke.
- Really?</font>

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.</font>

126
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was smart, so I liked it.</font>

127
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I've seen you before.</font>

128
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Every choice that we make...</i></font>

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...would create countless
other possibilities.</i></font>

130
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A what-if to infinity.</i></font>

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A zero?</font>

132
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few more of those, you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?</font>

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'm just not right for this school.</font>

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers...</font>

135

137
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,599

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way to get all the answers wrong
is to know which answers are right.</font>

139
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying to quit.</font>

140
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not gonna let you.</font>

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assigning you a personal essay.</font>

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not about physics, but about you...</i></font>

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and what kind of person
you want to be.</i></font>

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron! Hey! Were you scared?</font>

145
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want that?</font>

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's up with school?
- Going great! Got tons of friends.</font>

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't tell me it's all that bad there.
Smart girls is where it's at.</font>

148
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place must be full of 'em.</font>

149
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there's no one.</font>

150
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine
on the streets with no game.</font>

151
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got game.</font>

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a new girl. Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me. You know how it is.</font>

153
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's her name?</font>

154
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we layin' down
the groundwork right now.</font>

155
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know about the shoulder touch?</font>

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Course I do.</font>

157
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But tell me anyway.</font>

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:</font>

159
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>

160
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You serious, Uncle Aaron?
- I'm tellin' you, man, it's science.</font>

161
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So walk up to her and be like: "Hey."</font>

162
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no. Like: "Hey."</font>

163
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>

164
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. "Hey."</font>

165
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey."</font>

166
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure you my nephew, man?
Is that her?</font>

167
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.</font>

168
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?</font>

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naw, man. You know my dad. I can't.</font>

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
I got a spot you ain't gon' believe.</font>

171
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naw, I can't. I can't. Can't.</font>

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get in so much trouble.</font>

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man.
Tell him your art teacher made you.</font>

174
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you know about this place?
- Did an engineering job down here.</font>

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

176
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man, I knew we were related.</font>

177
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

178
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn!</font>

179
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a lot of history on these walls.</font>

180
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so fresh.</font>

181
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you on your own, Miles.</font>

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, slow down a little.</font>

183
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's better.</font>

184
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what you got now?
Makin' mistakes is part of it.</font>

185
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real Miles comin' outta hidin'.</font>

186
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you can cut that line
with another color.</font>

187
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little help?</font>

188
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you want drips?</font>

189
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if you do, that's cool,
but if you don't, you gotta keep it moving.</font>

190
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's intentional.</font>

191
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it too crazy?
- No, man.</font>

192
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.</font>

193
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.</font>

194
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop lyin'.
- It's true.</font>

195
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know...</font>

196
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good guy, just...</font>

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm sayin'.</font>

198
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come on, man. I gotta roll.</font>

199
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, let's go.</font>

200
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's weird.</i></font>

201
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My pants shrank.</i></font>

202
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I hit puberty.</font>

203
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta get new pants.</i></font>

204
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wait. Why is the voice in my head
so loud?</i></font>

205
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

206
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- What?</font>

207
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why am I so sweaty?</i></font>

208
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you so sweaty?</font>

209
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a puberty thing.</font>

210
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.</font>

211
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, but I'm done.</font>

212
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a man.</font>

213
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're, like, new here, right?
We got that in common.</font>

214
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's one thing.</font>

215
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Yeah.</font>

216
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Miles.</font>

217
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Gwe... anda.</font>

218
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, your name is Gwanda?</font>

219
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's African. I'm South African.</font>

220
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No accent though
'cause I was raised here.</font>

221
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do the shoulder touch now
before she walks away.</i></font>

222
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is this so scary?</i></font>

223
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?</i></font>

224
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy.</font>

225
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

226
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you around.</font>

228
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you.</font>

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- Hey.</font>

230
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, crap.
- Can you let go, please?</font>

231
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't let go.
- Calm down. It's fine.</font>

232
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, let go.
- Workin' on it.</font>

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just puberty.</font>

234
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you know what puberty is.
Just relax.</font>

235
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, I have a plan.
- Great.</font>

236
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna pull really hard.
- That's a terrible plan.</font>

237
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 1.
- Don't do this.</font>

238
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 2.
- 3!</font>

239
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you?</font>

240
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. Total pleasure.</font>

241
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one saw. It's okay.</i></font>

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one knows, no one knows.</i></font>

243
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everyone knows.</i></font>

244
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everyone knows. They're talkin'
'bout me. They saw everything!</i></font>

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He knows. She knows. They know.</i></font>

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wow, she's super tall.</i></font>

247
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is he smiling? Am I
the weird guy now? What am I doing?</i></font>

248
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy's such a weirdo.</font>

249
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How do I stop?</i></font>

250
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can they hear my thoughts?!
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!</i></font>

251
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I know you snuck out last night,
Morales.</font>

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Play dumb!</i></font>

253
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Morales?</font>

254
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not that dumb!</i></font>

255
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

256
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,395

257
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He'll never find you.</i></font>

258
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No.</i></font>

259
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing in my office,
Morales?!</font>

260
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morales! Open up!</font>

261
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,391

275
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could there be two Spider-Men?
There can't be two Spider-Men.</font>

281
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's just puberty.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

284
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta tell someone.</i></font>

285
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.</font>

286
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the spider.</font>

287
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see.</font>

288
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a normal spider.</font>

289
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.</font>

290
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm right here.</i></font>

291
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why is this happening to me?</i></font>

292
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i></font>

293
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Way over there.</i></font>

294
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're like me.</i></font>

295
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Miles. Look out.</i></font>

296
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I don't wanna be a hero.
- Miles.</i></font>

297
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Norman, listen to me.</font>

298
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Spider-Man?</i></font>

299
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.</font>

300
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn is not zoned for that.</font>

301
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not up to me.</font>

302
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i></font>

303
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why won't you quit?!</font>

304
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked
into a black hole.</font>

305
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm gonna go.</font>

306
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.</font>

307
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

308
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>

309
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this place?</font>

310
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know your shoes are untied?</font>

311
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a onesie,
so I don't really have to worry about it.</font>

312
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.</font>

313
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna be.</font>

314
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.</font>

315
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a lot going through your head,
I'm sure.</font>

316
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

317
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be fine. I can help you.</font>

318
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.</font>

319
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

320
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick...</font>

321
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...before the space-time continuum
collapses.</font>

322
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

323
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you in a bit.</font>

324
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How does he do that?</i></font>

325
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it here? No, no, it's here.</font>

326
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, folks.</font>

327
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always get this wrong.</font>

328
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

329
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prowler.</font>

330
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I was in the middle of something.</font>

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so tired.</font>

332
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.</font>

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That all you got?</font>

334
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, so gross.</font>

335
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I should go up there and help him.</i></font>

336
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i></font>

337
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.</font>

338
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like my new toy?</font>

339
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cost me a fortune,
but, hey, can't take it with you, right?</font>

340
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came all this way. Watch the test.</font>

341
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a hell of a freaking light show.
You're gonna love this.</font>

342
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, don't do this! Stop!</font>

343
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!</font>

344
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see multiple dimensions opening!</font>

345
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was 3, 4
and 5 separate dimensions.</font>

346
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unstable! We should stop.</font>

347
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Norm, what's your take on head trauma?</font>

348
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to warn you, pal.</font>

349
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goblin, no! Get him outta there!</font>

350
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wilson! Where are we?</i></font>

351
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Really weird.</i></font>

352
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wilson!</i></font>

353
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Are you okay?</font>

354
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.</font>

355
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't you get up?
- Yeah.</font>

356
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I always get up.</font>

357
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The coughing's probably not a good sign.</font>

358
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find him. Now.</font>

359
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.</font>

360
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This override key is the only way
to stop the collider.</font>

361
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.</font>

362
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to hide your face.</font>

363
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't tell anyone who you are.</font>

364
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.</font>

365
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he turns the machine on again,
everything you know will disappear.</font>

366
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family, everyone.</font>

367
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone.</font>

368
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promise me you'll do this.</font>

369
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>

370
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Destroy the collider.</font>

371
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come and find you.</font>

372
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be okay.</font>

373
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tombstone. We're done with tests.</font>

374
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that thing ready to go again.
And soon.</font>

375
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run faster!</font>

376
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys are weak.</font>

377
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say it's nice to see you again,
Spider-Man, but it's not.</font>

378
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kingpin. How's business?</font>

379
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boomin'.</font>

380
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.</font>

381
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might open a black hole
under Brooklyn.</font>

382
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be worth the risk.</font>

383
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not always about the money,
Spider-Man.</font>

384
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?</font>

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

386
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're trying to do...</font>

387
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and it won't work.</font>

388
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gone.</font>

389
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the body.</font>

390
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

391
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill that guy.</font>

392
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop sticking!</font>

393
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i></font>

394
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.</font>

395
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police! Put your hands up!</font>

396
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Miles?</font>

397
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you at school?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.</font>

398
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Que te pasa?</font>

399
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the earthquake?</font>

400
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I sleep here tonight?</font>

401
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles. It's a weeknight.
You made a commitment to that school.</font>

402
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's upset.</font>

403
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you can stay.</font>

404
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad?
- Yeah.</font>

405
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really hate Spider-Man?</font>

406
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...</font>

407
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeff, mi amor.</font>

408
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? He asked me. Baby, you know
how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.</font>

409
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.</i></font>

410
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?</font>

411
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?</font>

412
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.</font>

413
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>

414
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that about?
- He's having a hard time, Jeff.</font>

415
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it gets hard,
that's when he's gotta stick it out.</font>

anyone behind the mask.</i></font>

427
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.</i></font>

428
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to miss him.</font>

429
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

430
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were friends, you know.</font>

431
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I return it if it doesn't fit?</font>

432
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It always fits...</font>

433
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...eventually.</font>

434
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He didn't ask for his powers...</i></font>

435
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i></font>

436
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My favorite thing about Peter...</i></font>

437
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...is that he made us each feel powerful.</i></font>

438
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i></font>

439
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in our own way...</font>

440
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we are all Spider-Man.</font>

441
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And we're all counting on you.</i></font>

442
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're counting on me.</font>

443
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.</font>

444
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.</font>

445
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing you gave me, that key...</font>

446
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I think I really messed it up.</font>

447
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna do what you asked.</font>

448
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really do.</font>

449
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sorry.</font>

450
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure I'm the guy.</font>

451
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this without you.</font>

452
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid.</font>

453
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I do to him?!</font>

454
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

455
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

456
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i></font>

457
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i></font>

458
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>

459
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for the last 22 years...</i></font>

460
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i></font>

461
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a day.</font>

462
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i></font>

463
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married...</i></font>

464
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i></font>

465
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i></font>

466
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i></font>

467
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i></font>

468
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I broke my back, a drone flew
into my face, I buried Aunt May.</i></font>

469
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My wife and I... split up.</i></font>

470
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I handled it like a champion.</i></font>

471
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause, you know what, no matter how
many times I get hit, I always get back up.</i></font>

472
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I got a lot of time to reflect
and work on myself.</i></font>

473
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i></font>

474
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Could you imagine?</i></font>

475
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A seahorse seeing another seahorse...</i></font>

476
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and then making it work?</i></font>

477
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She wanted kids and...
And it scared me.</i></font>

478
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.</i></font>

479
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Flash-forward:
I'm in my apartment doing push-ups...</i></font>

480
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...doing ab crunches, getting strong...</i></font>

481
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...when this weird thing happened.</i></font>

482
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I gotta say,
weird things happen to me a lot.</i></font>

483
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But this was real weird.</i></font>

484
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i></font>

485
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Also, I was dead.</i></font>

486
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And blond.</i></font>

487
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was kind of perfect.</i></font>

488
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It was like looking in a mirror.</i></font>

489
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have a feeling that the thing that brought
me here was the thing that got him killed.</i></font>

490
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You wanna know what happened next?</i></font>

491
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Me, too.</i></font>

492
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

493
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doin' over there?</font>

494
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze! PDNY.</font>

495
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

496
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me right now?</font>

497
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop!</font>

498
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotcha. I gotcha.</font>

499
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid. Drop the body.</font>

500
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, kid. Get over here!
- Come on, now!</font>

501
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you, officers!</font>

502
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, come on.</font>

503
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, kid.
- Kid, come on, now!</font>

504
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put 'em up, son!</font>

505
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... adiós?</font>

506
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Somebody stop that train!</font>

507
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey. What the...?</font>

508
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

509
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna die!</font>

510
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Looks like a child dressed
like Spider-Man...</i></font>

511
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i></font>

512
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! I didn't kill you.</font>

513
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- Who are you?</font>

514
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why are you trying to kill me?
- I'm not. I'm trying to save you.</font>

515
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, maybe you guys can go around?</font>

516
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Thanks, New York.</font>

517
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What was that?</i></font>

518
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Kid electrocuted me...</i></font>

519
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...with his hands.</i></font>

520
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're like me.
- I got some questions.</font>

521
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you look like Peter Parker?</font>

522
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I am Peter Parker.</font>

523
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?</font>

524
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you older?
And why is your body...</font>

525
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a different shape?</font>

526
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure you just called me fat.</font>

527
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look so hot either, kid.</font>

528
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.</font>

529
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a ghost?
- No.</font>

530
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.</font>

531
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.</font>

532
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you from another dimension?</font>

533
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a parallel universe where things
are like this universe but different?</font>

534
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're Spider-Man in that universe?</font>

535
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But somehow traveled to this universe,
but you don't know how?</font>

536
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow. That was really just a guess?
- We learned about it in physics.</font>

537
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!</font>

538
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can teach me
like Peter said he would.</font>

539
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before he died.</font>

540
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.</font>

541
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I made a promise to him.</font>

542
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's lesson number 1, kid.</font>

543
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.</font>

544
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, seriously...</font>

545
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, kid.
This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.</font>

546
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, are you okay?</font>

547
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not.</font>

548
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on with your body?</font>

549
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think my atoms are real jazzed
about being in the wrong dimension.</font>

550
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm not looking for a side gig
as a Spider-Man coach.</font>

551
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a lot going on in my dimension.</font>

552
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"With great power comes great..."</font>

553
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you dare finish that sentence.
Don't do it! I'm sick of it.</font>

554
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.</font>

555
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got
a supercollider. He's tryin' to kill me.</font>

556
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.</font>

557
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?</font>

558
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.</font>

559
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goodbye.
- Where you going?</font>

560
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it runs again,
I'll jump in and get back to my life.</font>

561
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't let them run it.</font>

562
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm supposed to destroy it so it never
runs again or everyone's gonna die.</font>

563
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.</font>

564
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there's always a little bit of time
before everybody dies...</font>

565
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and that's when I do my best work.</font>

566
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you gonna need this?</font>

567
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, you have a goober. Give it.</font>

568
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.</font>

569
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.</font>

570
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.</font>

571
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need it to destroy the collider.
- I need it to go home.</font>

572
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.</font>

573
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I said...</font>

574
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The collider created a portal
that brought me here. And I have to get...</font>

575
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.</font>

576
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember what happened.</font>

577
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, this is why I never had kids.</font>

578
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't we make another one?
- We can't do anything.</font>

579
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you, I have to re-steal
what your guy stole from Alchemax...</font>

580
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and make another one of these.</font>

581
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave...</font>

582
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...everyone in this city, my parents,
my uncle and millions of others, will die.</font>

583
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're just gonna go home and
leave me here to figure this out for myself?</font>

584
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.</font>

585
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

586
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Making you feel guilty. Is it working?</font>

587
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could it...? No. Look at me.
Does it look like it's working?</font>

588
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, it's not...</font>

589
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No! Do not let him win!</font>

590
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, kid. You win.</font>

591
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we don't have a second to lose.</font>

592
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this burger. So delicious.</font>

593
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the best burgers I've ever had.</font>

594
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my universe,
this place closed 6 years ago.</font>

595
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why. I really don't.</font>

596
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.</font>

597
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we focus?
- Sure.</font>

598
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?</font>

599
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm listening.</font>

600
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other Peter said he was
gonna be showing me the ropes.</font>

601
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any Spider-Man tips
you can tell me now?</font>

602
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got plenty.</font>

603
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disinfect the mask.</font>

604
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna wanna use baby powder
in the suit, heavy on the joints.</font>

605
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want any chafing, right?</font>

606
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.</font>

607
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.</font>

608
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look up where Alchemax is.</font>

609
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."</font>

610
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can teach me
to swing on the way there.</font>

611
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley,
Miles. Not after a hearty burger breakfast.</font>

612
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.</font>

613
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.</font>

614
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that off. It's disrespectful.
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.</font>

615
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So how do we retrace Peter's steps?
- That's a good question.</font>

616
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would I do if I were me?</font>

617
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

618
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 1: I infiltrate the lab.</i></font>

619
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>2: Find the head scientist's computer.</i></font>

620
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That lady with the bike is the head
scientist. I saw her in this documentary.</i></font>

621
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Cool! Step 3:
I reexamine my personal biases.</i></font>

622
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 4: I hack the computer.</i></font>

623
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not technically hacking.</font>

624
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not now. I just lost my train of thought.</font>

625
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 5: Download the important stuff.
I'll know it when I see it.</i></font>

626
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 6: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i></font>

627
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what am I doing?</font>

628
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step 7: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.</font>

629
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do
Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help.</font>

630
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!</font>

631
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I get stuck with the janky,
old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!</font>

632
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's new.</font>

633
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin.</font>

634
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What am I doing? What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?</i></font>

635
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

636
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

637
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.</font>

638
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just move over.</font>

639
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.</font>

640
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man
die without doing anything about it.</font>

641
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not doing that again.</font>

642
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

643
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me...</font>

644
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so you're a nice change of pace.</font>

645
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.</font>

646
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you can't really understand it,
but these are really good numbers.</font>

647
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I got the password.</font>

648
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week...</font>

649
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.</font>

650
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see this? And this?</font>

651
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is multiple dimensions beginning
to crash into each other.</font>

652
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it.</font>

653
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this. He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."</font>

654
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got 24 hours.</font>

655
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What this means is there could be
a rupture in the space-time continuum.</font>

656
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's bad. Actually, everything
she said was bad. I was lying before.</font>

657
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. Let me get you some more data.</font>

658
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.</font>

659
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, relax your fingers. We don't
have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.</font>

660
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.</font>

661
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.</font>

662
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need more time.</font>

663
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're right there.
They're gonna see you.</font>

664
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, you gotta unstick.</font>

665
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do to relax?</font>

666
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. Okay, okay, okay.</font>

667
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for crying out loud.</font>

668
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teenagers: just the worst.</font>

669
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.</font>

670
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.</font>

671
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.</font>

672
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just poked me in my eye!</font>

673
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.</font>

674
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

675
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember this password.
D-g-f-a-m-p-e-s-a-n-d...</font>

676
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down!</font>

677
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.</font>

678
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.</font>

679
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.</font>

680
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man?</font>

681
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.</font>

682
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.
You're supposed to be dead.</font>

683
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.</font>

684
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is fascinating.</font>

685
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's my face.</font>

686
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An entirely different Peter Parker.</font>

687
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little bit of a gut,
perhaps from dimensional warping.</font>

688
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.</font>

689
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Travel through the multiverse appears
to have deteriorated the...</font>

690
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the rest?!</font>

691
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how old are you?
'Cause you don't look a day over 35.</font>

692
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!</font>

693
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You showed 'em you're not crazy.</font>

694
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might pinch a little.</font>

695
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I just need to get these samples.</font>

696
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

697
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Organize your desktop, lady.</font>

698
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Just complete cellular decay.</font>

699
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen anything like this.</font>

700
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking the whole thing.</font>

701
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And obviously you've been glitching.</font>

702
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Glitchin"? No.
Why would you even say that?</font>

703
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stay in this dimension too long,
your body's gonna disintegrate.</font>

704
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?</font>

705
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

706
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't imagine.</font>

707
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I, for one...</font>

708
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...can't wait to watch.</font>

709
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say your name was?</font>

710
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Olivia Octavius.</font>

711
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I assume
that your friends call you Doc Ock?</font>

712
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends actually call me Liv.</font>

713
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My enemies call me Doc Ock.</font>

714
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this! Run!</font>

715
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking to?</font>

716
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?</font>

717
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it handled, buddy!</font>

718
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is fine!</font>

719
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, this is a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.</font>

720
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta go.</font>

721
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.</font>

722
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.</font>

723
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

724
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!</font>

725
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you give me that back,
young man?</font>

726
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

727
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's proprietary.</font>

728
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This'd be a good time to turn invisible.
- Yep.</font>

729
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.</font>

730
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Act super normal.</font>

731
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man?</font>

732
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, that's funny, I get that a lot.
- Hey.</font>

733
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!</font>

734
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we do a switchy-switchy.</font>

735
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back here!
Where do you think you're going?</font>

736
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took a bagel!</font>

737
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Time to swing, just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?</font>

738
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.</font>

739
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

740
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready!</font>

741
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this yet!</font>

742
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody knows
that the best way to learn...</font>

743
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is under intense
life-threatening pressure.</font>

744
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

745
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

746
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing down there?</font>

747
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I run better than I swing.</font>

748
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta swing or they'll catch you.</font>

749
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what you wanted.</font>

750
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

751
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back, little boy.</font>

752
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.</font>

753
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!</font>

754
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shoot off your back foot.</font>

755
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!</font>

756
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the best idea you've had all day!</font>

757
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice, Miles!</font>

758
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. You're doin' it.</font>

759
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.</font>

760
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thwip and release.</font>

761
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.</font>

762
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a natural. Thwip. Release.</font>

763
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Feel the rhythm?
- Thwip. And release!</font>

764
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good, Miles.
- I gotta say, you're amazing, man.</font>

765
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a little team!</font>

766
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me as the teacher who could still do it.</font>

767
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You as the student who can do it,
just not as good.</font>

768
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of us. Is there something
you want to say to me?</font>

769
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

770
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the...?
- Who did that?</font>

771
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys.</font>

772
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gwanda?</font>

773
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Gwen, actually.</font>

774
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know her. Very cool.</font>

775
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from another dimension.</font>

776
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, another-another dimension.</font>

777
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i></font>

778
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Gwen Stacy.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>

779
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for the last 2 years, I've been
the one and only Spider-Woman.</i></font>

780
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You guys know the rest.</i></font>

781
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I joined a band.</i></font>

782
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Saved my dad.</i></font>

783
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I couldn't save my best friend...</i></font>

784
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...Peter Parker...</i></font>

785
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...so now I save everyone else.</i></font>

786
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I don't do friends anymore...</i></font>

787
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...just to avoid any distractions.</i></font>

788
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And one day this weird thing happened.</i></font>

789
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I mean, like, really weird.</i></font>

790
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was blown into last week.</i></font>

791
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Literally.</i></font>

792
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i></font>

793
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lucky for these folks,
Spider-Man was there to save the day.</i></font>

794
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i></font>

795
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you guys are early.</font>

796
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wasn't sure why until I met you.</i></font>

797
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your haircut.</font>

798
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get to like my haircut.</font>

799
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

800
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many more Spider-People
are there?</font>

801
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save it for Comic-Con.</font>

802
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's Comic-Con?</font>

803
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're dead, Spider-Man.</font>

804
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilson! What are you doing?</font>

805
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa.</font>

806
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard, come on.</font>

807
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa! Richard!</font>

808
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No!</i></font>

809
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.</font>

810
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed Spider-Man.</font>

811
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I just see two more?</font>

812
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's three, actually.</font>

813
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is good. This is very, very good.</font>

814
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This means you get what you want.</font>

815
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means my collider works.</font>

816
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.</font>

817
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the collider will bring
your family back.</font>

818
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As many families as you want.</font>

819
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, at my collider.</font>

820
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our collider.</font>

821
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He broke this?</font>

822
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed
about it, so just keep it between us, okay?</font>

823
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where we can make a new one.
And we won't let him break it this time.</font>

824
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about your friend.</font>

825
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Miles.</font>

826
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how hard this is. To have
to figure this stuff out on your own.</font>

827
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.</font>

828
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

829
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever decide to do friends again,
I could always open up a slot.</font>

830
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll keep you posted.</font>

831
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>

832
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should probably go.</font>

833
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.</font>

834
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
- Just relax.</font>

835
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are all very sweet,
but no more fans today, please.</font>

836
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not ready for this.</font>

837
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter?</font>

838
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Aunt May.</font>

839
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...</font>

840
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An alternate dimension.</font>

841
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

842
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look tired, Peter.</font>

843
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I am tired.</font>

844
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.</font>

845
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?</font>

846
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup, that's what they are.</font>

847
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there...</font>

848
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when it all happened.</font>

849
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry.</font>

850
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what dimension are you from?</font>

851
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn.</font>

852
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Peter have a place where we could
make another one of these?</font>

853
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A goober.</font>

854
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

855
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. A little,
old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.</font>

856
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this place is pretentious.</font>

857
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

858
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude. Was yours anything like this?</font>

859
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine was like this,
but take away the jeep, the plane.</font>

860
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.</font>

861
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel sad for this guy.</font>

862
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Peter.</font>

863
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is a cape.</font>

864
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter knew how dangerous the job was.</font>

865
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy was Spider-Man.</font>

866
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin knows we're coming.</font>

867
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to be outnumbered.</font>

868
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be so sure.</font>

869
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might need these.</font>

870
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?</font>

871
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fellas.</font>

872
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he in black and white?</font>

873
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.</font>

874
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever I go, the wind follows.</font>

875
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the wind, it smells like rain.</font>

876
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, guys!</font>

877
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could literally not get any weirder.</font>

878
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can get weirder.</font>

879
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.</font>

880
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other reason.</font>

881
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're like me.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Enough!</font>

898
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how did you get here?</font>

899
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's kind of a long story.</font>

900
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe not that long.</font>

901
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now we're just trying
to find a way home.</font>

902
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way home is back through
that collider gizmo. The only trouble is...</font>

903
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.</font>

904
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it.</font>

905
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. You guys don't get it.</font>

906
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get what?</font>

907
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.</font>

01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This kid can turn himself invisible.
Watch this. He can do it now.</font>

915
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't do it on command.

946
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,351

we have to stay and do it for him.</font>

I know the kid.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you he's gonna come back through
that door, recharged and ready to fight.</font>

984
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?</font>

985
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My uncle Aaron, he's the Prowler.</font>

986
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down, Miles.
- He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me!</font>

987
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a pretty hard-core origin story.</font>

988
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.</font>

989
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.</font>

990
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cute place. Real homey.
- Oh, great. It's Liv.</font>

991
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I was followed.</font>

992
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

993
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here, kid.</font>

994
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.</font>

995
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.</font>

996
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you mind taking this outside?</font>

997
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.</font>

998
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I think I'll be taking that.</font>

999
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand, niñito, dale. Prepárate a morir.</i></font>

1000
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, stupid pillows.</font>

1001
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, take it outside!</font>

1002
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it!</font>

1003
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this, buddy.</font>

1004
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave the kid alone!</font>

1005
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! No!</font>

1006
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta go, man.</font>

1007
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All vehicles in the area,
we have a disturbance...</i></font>

1008
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...involving multiple Spider... people?</i></font>

1009
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. On my way.</font>

1010
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that thing.</font>

1011
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be stupid, kid. Hand it over, now!</font>

1012
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nowhere left to run.</font>

1013
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles?</font>

1014
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron.</font>

1015
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

1016
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Uncle Aaron.</font>

1017
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Prowler.</i></font>

1018
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you waitin' for? Finish it.</font>

1019
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here!</font>

1020
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1021
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles.</font>

1022
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Aaron.</font>

1023
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my fault.</font>

1024
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Miles.</font>

1025
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1026
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted you to look up to me.</font>

1027
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I let you down, man. I let you down.</font>

1028
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the best of all of us, Miles.</font>

1029
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on your way.</font>

1030
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep going.</font>

1031
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep going.</font>

1032
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands up!</font>

1033
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your arms up. Now!</font>

1034
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around.</font>

1035
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey!</font>

1036
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aaron. Aaron, no. No!</font>

1037
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All units.</font>

1038
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want an APB on a new Spider-Man.</font>

1039
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bud.</font>

1040
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1041
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've all been there.
You know, for me...</font>

1042
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it was my Uncle Ben.</font>

1043
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my Uncle Benjamin.</font>

1044
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my father.</font>

1045
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was my best friend.</font>

1046
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, the hardest thing about this job is...</font>

1047
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you can't always save everybody.</font>

1048
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.</font>

1049
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, we're probably the only ones
who do understand.</font>

1050
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1051
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That way, that way.</font>

1052
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other way, other way,
other way, other way.</font>

1053
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey there.</font>

1054
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do animals talk in this dimension?
'Cause I don't wanna freak him out.</font>

1055
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1056
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Miles.</font>

1057
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles, I came to say goodbye.
- We can say goodbye at the collider.</font>

1058
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not getting it.
You're staying here.</font>

1059
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to be there.
So you can all go home.</font>

1060
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.</font>

1061
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.</font>

1062
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing what needs to be done.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.</font>

1063
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about MJ?</font>

1064
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everything works out, kid.</font>

1065
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the goober.</font>

1066
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't make me take it from you.</font>

1067
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not fair!
You gotta tell them I can do this.</font>

1068
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't their decision.</font>

1069
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!</font>

1070
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.</font>

1071
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm ready. I promise!</font>

1072
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then venom-strike me right now.</font>

1073
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.</font>

1074
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know
how much you want this, kid.</font>

1075
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor little guy.</font>

1076
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you don't have it yet.</font>

1077
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1078
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When will I know I'm ready?</font>

1079
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't. It's a leap of faith.</font>

1080
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it is, Miles.</font>

1081
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A leap of faith.</font>

1082
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles.</font>

1083
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, it's your dad.</font>

1084
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please open the door.</font>

1085
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.</font>

1086
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.</font>

1087
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, can we talk for a minute?</font>

1088
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something...</font>

1089
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something happened to...</font>

1090
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.</font>

1091
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't want
that to happen to us, okay?</font>

1092
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I don't always do what you need
me to do or say what you need me to say.</font>

1093
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:15,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.</font>

1094
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's yours.</font>

1095
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.</font>

1096
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, call me when you can. Okay?</font>

1097
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1098
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to say it back, though.</font>

1099
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took you long enough.</font>

1100
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I see this spark in you. It's amazing.</i></font>

1101
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.</i></font>

1102
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our family doesn't run from things.</i></font>

1103
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're the best of all of us, Miles.
You're on your way.</i></font>

1104
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just keep going.</i></font>

1105
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When do I know I'm Spider-Man?</i></font>

1106
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You won't.</i></font>

1107
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's all it is, Miles.</i></font>

1108
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A leap of faith.</i></font>

1109
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Made 'em myself.</font>

1110
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They fit perfectly.</font>

1111
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin has a private elevator entrance
from his penthouse to the collider below.</font>

1112
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't count on having an audience.</font>

1113
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me.</font>

1114
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. It's nice to be with you
this evening to celebrate Spider-Man.</font>

1115
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He and I were very close.</font>

1116
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a pig.
- I'm right here.</font>

1117
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. Get a load
of how the waiters are dressed.</font>

1118
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in poor taste, but...</font>

1119
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be that easy.</font>

1120
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that easy.</font>

1121
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanna thank Mary Jane Parker
for being here this evening.</font>

1122
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MJ?</font>

1123
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?</font>

1124
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I'll be right back.</font>

1125
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter! Come here. Trust me. I've
been there. You gotta move on, buddy.</font>

1126
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will take 1 second. Let me just... Oh!</font>

1127
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- Oh, wow.</font>

1128
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wondered if we could have
some more bread at table 12.</font>

1129
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1130
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just... I'm really sorry.</font>

1131
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Don't be sorry. It's just bread.</font>

1132
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.</font>

1133
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even try.</font>

1134
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fine.
You know, I should really get going.</font>

1135
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:37,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I could do better if I just had
another chance to give you...</font>

1136
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the bread that you deserve.</font>

1137
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- We'll take care of that bread right now.</font>

1138
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's been nice talking to you.</font>

1139
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, they should fill this place up
with fresh bread.</font>

1140
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.</font>

1141
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, 'cause we are not getting
any bread.</font>

1142
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just sorry my family can't see
what we're doing here tonight.</font>

1143
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Initializing primary ignition sequence.</i></font>

1144
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep.</font>

1145
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the sequence.</font>

1146

1150
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, you don't have to stay behind.
I can do it.</font>

1151
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1152
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've made up my mind.</font>

1153
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.</font>

1154
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you're gone, I'll blow it up.</font>

1155
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, guys.</font>

1156
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know we're here.</font>

1157
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you again, Peter.</font>

1158
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I got you covered!</i></font>

1159
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys are the pits.</font>

1160
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this always difficult?</font>

1161
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you going, Peter?</font>

1162
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any last words?</font>

1163
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a minute to think about it?
You have a pen?</font>

1164
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, Peter Parker.</font>

1165
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did that?!</font>

1166
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles?
- Spider-Man?</font>

1167
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow, Miles. You're doing it on command!
- It's about time, right?</font>

1168
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.</font>

1169
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you! I am so proud of you!</font>

1170
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I want kids?</font>

1171
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I forgot about her.</font>

1172
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:44,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, that doesn't look promising.
- No, it doesn't.</font>

1173
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I've got genetic matches. Hold on.</i></font>

1174
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too risky.</font>

1175
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up and turn it up.</font>

1176
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On your left!
- On your right!</font>

1177
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got 5 o'clock!
3 o'clock! 2 o'clock!</font>

1178
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every direction!</font>

1179
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to a shelter. I'll be right there.</font>

1180
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried the school, but I can't get through.</font>

1181
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, are you seeing this?</font>

1182
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.</font>

1183
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does look cool though, right?</font>

1184
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get back up there.</font>

1185
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that all you got? You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?</font>

1186
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hard-boiled turtle slapper!</font>

1187
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?</font>

1188
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a problem with cartoons?</font>

1189
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blammo!</font>

1190
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did that feel like a cartoon?</font>

1191
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gwen!</font>

1192
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your suit.</font>

1193
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. I made it myself.</font>

1194
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!</font>

1195
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.</font>

1196
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Never mind.</font>

1197
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's end this thing.</font>

1198
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I got it.</font>

1199
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go. I'm the one with the goo...</font>

1200
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you gotta be kidding me.</font>

1201
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.</font>

1202
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miles!
- Be careful!</font>

1203
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was crazy.</font>

1204
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We taught him that, right?</font>

1205
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.</font>

1206
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1207
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1208
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!</font>

1209
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alert! Quantum polarity

1210
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess this is it.</font>

1211
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, nice to know we're not alone.</font>

1212
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right?
- Yeah.</font>

1213
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the portal open. You first, Peni.</font>

1214
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Miles.</font>

1215
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From both of us.</font>

1216
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh, love you all.</font>

1217
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm taking this cube thing with me.</font>

1218
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand it.</font>

1219
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I will.</font>

1220
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to have this.</font>

1221
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll fit in your pocket.</font>

1222
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all, folks.</font>

1223
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he allowed to say that, legally?</font>

1224
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I get to like the hairdo now?</font>

1225
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'm older than you.</font>

1226
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">15 months, but it's pretty significant
if you ask me.</font>

1227
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?</font>

1228
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

1229
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends?</font>

1230
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends.</font>

1231
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>

1232
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you around, Spider-Man.</font>

1233
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your turn.</font>

1234
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. Right.</font>

1235
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going anywhere!</font>

1236
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll hold him off. You shut this down.</font>

1237
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, that wasn't the deal!</font>

1238
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!</font>

1239
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!</font>

1240
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.</font>

1241
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither can I.</font>

1242
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1243
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it is okay.</font>

1244
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta go home, man.</font>

1245
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?</font>

1246
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't.</font>

1247
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1248
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a leap of faith.</font>

1249
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, kid.</font>

1250
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kingpin!</font>

1251
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope!</font>

1252
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry! That's cheating.</font>

1253
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Adiós.</i></font>

1254
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,631

01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:47,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1256
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?</font>

1257
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.</font>

1258
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where am I?
- What?</font>

1259
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilson?</font>

1260
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:06,599

- What are you doing?</font>

1261

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanessa. Vanessa.</font>

1262
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.</font>

1263
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me. You know me.</font>

1264
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're leaving now.</font>

1265
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go.</font>

1266
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me.</font>

1267
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!</font>

1268
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not stopping this. Not today.</font>

1269
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am stopping this. Right now!</font>

1270
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need backup.</font>

1271
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1272
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.</font>

1273
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're nothing!</font>

1274
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took my family.</font>

1275
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.</font>

1276
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up, Spider-Man.</font>

1277
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:19,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up! Come on!</font>

1278
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on. Come on.</font>

1279
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll always have my family.</font>

1280
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever hear of the shoulder touch?</font>

1281
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1282
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1283
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!</font>

1284
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles? Miles? Are you okay?</font>

1285
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i></font>

1286
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're probably busy...</font>

1287
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No! I can talk, I can talk.</i></font>

1288
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, so I came by earlier because...</i></font>

1289
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.</font>

1290
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry.</font>

1291
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1292
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know who did it?</font>

1293
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I did.</font>

1294
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was wrong.</font>

1295
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Miles, what I said at the door...</font>

1296
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it wasn't just talk.</font>

1297
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you know, I was thinking
maybe we could find a nice wall...</font>

1298
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...privately owned,
like at the police station...</font>

1299
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:42,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and you could "throw up"
some of your art.</font>

1300
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I'm bad at this.</font>

1301
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?</font>

1302
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!</font>

1303
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Officer.
- Spider-Man!</font>

1304
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, down there, that was...</font>

1305
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I owe you...</font>

1306
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay!</font>

1307
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I look forward to workin' with you.</font>

1308
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:12,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me, too. I guess.</font>

1309
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't approve of your methods...</font>

1310
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:19,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.</font>

1311
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your bravery tonight.</font>

1312
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1313
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what?</font>

1314
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look behind you!</font>

1315
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Cool. Yeah.</font>

1316
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks, Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man, a su servicio. Thank you.</font>

1317
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, man. What's up, little man?
- New Spider-Man.</font>

1318
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:48,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.
Check it out.</font>

1319
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was part of the move.</font>

1320
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?
For real this time. This is it.</i></font>

1321
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:00,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i></font>

1322
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for like 2 days, I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.</i></font>

1323
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:07,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I think you know the rest.
I finished my essay.</i></font>

1324
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Saved a bunch of people.</i></font>

1325
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got hit by a drone.</i></font>

1326
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I did this with my dad.</i></font>

1327
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Met my roommate. Finally.</i></font>

1328
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Slapped a sticker
where my dad's never gonna find it.</i></font>

1329
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And when I feel alone, like no one
understands what I'm going through...</i></font>

1330
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...I remember my friends who get it.</i></font>

1331
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I never thought
I'd be able to do any of this stuff.</i></font>

1332
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I can.</i></font>

1333
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anyone can wear the mask.</i></font>

1334
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You could wear the mask.</i></font>

1335
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.</i></font>

1336
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause I'm Spider-Man.</i></font>

1337
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I'm not the only one.</i></font>

1338
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not by a long shot.</i></font>

1339
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miles. Miles!</font>

1340
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a minute?</font>

1341
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're a bit late.
- We can't all be everywhere at once.</font>

1342
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little text might've been nice.</font>

1343
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was gone for less than 2 hours.
What happened?</font>

1344
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I know what it looks like.</font>

1345
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:42,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.</font>

1346
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The multiverse didn't collapse.</font>

1347
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.</font>

1348
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it worked out.</font>

1349
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:50,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great story. Did you finish the goober?
- It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.</font>

1350
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you always have to call me out?
It's just really frustrating and bums me out.</font>

1351
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get excited, Miguel.</font>

1352
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.</font>

1353
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:59,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you could be the first person
to make an autonomous multiverse jump.</font>

1354
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the last.</font>

1355
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?</font>

1356
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?</font>

1357
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:08,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's start at the beginning one last time.</font>

1358
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth '67.</font>

1359
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! What the...?</font>

1360
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Spider-Man.</font>

1361
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?</font>

1362
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.</font>

1363
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.</font>

1364
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's rude to point.
- You're being very rude.</font>

1365
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one pointed first?</font>

1366
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.</font>

1367
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.</font>

1368
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at your finger.</font>

1369
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.</font>

1370
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't seen pointing.</font>

1371
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!</font>
