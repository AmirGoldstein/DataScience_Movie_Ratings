1
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,878
The things you're saying are not
enough reasons to get a divorce.

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
- If you have other reasons,
lets hear them. - Like what other reasons?

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,278
Like your husban being an addict, or beating you
or not giving you pocket money.

4
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,557
No, he's neither an addict nor does he have any issues;
in fact he's a very nice and decent person.

5
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,358
Then why do you want to get a divorce?

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,153
Becuase he doesn't want to come with me.

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,949
If he said he'd come with me, 
I'll withdraw my claim right now.

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,440
- Are you willing to come?
- No, I'm not.

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,552
- Why not, Judge? Tell me why he won't.
- You know the reason already.

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,035
No, I do not know.
Please explain it one more time.

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,759
Let her give me one reason why in this situation
we should leave for abroad.

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,235
- Show me a good reason why we should stay.
- I'll give you a thousand reasons.

13
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,716
- Tell me just one.
- My dad. I can't leave him. 
Do I need to give more?

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,915
But you can leave your wife?

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,190
- When did I ever leave you? 
You brought me here.

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,998
- What did you do?
- You were the one who applied for the divorce.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,191
When you tell your wife and kid to go,
is that not leaving?

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,914
Did he not just say you can go if you want to?

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,799
Yes, and I'll say it again.
When you don't want to live with me, 

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,593
I'm not going to force you to. Just Go.
- Calm down. Keep your voices down. 

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,470
Someday day you wanted to live witn me;
 now you don't want to.

22
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,516
- When you prefer to go over there...
- What do you mean "prefer"?

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,835
This is something that we both started.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,515
Judge, after a year and a half of running around
and all the costs, we finally got our visas.

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,598
It's been six months that they've come,
and they'll expire in 40 days.

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,478
Why should we lose this opportunity?

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,949
You don't want to miss this opportunity, OK;
Lets hear your proposal.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,110
You know our situation now, 

29
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,196
Tell us what we should do.
Judge, what should we do?

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,033
This reason he's using as an excuse right now: his father...
- I didn't use it as an excuse...

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,232
- You said give me one reason...
- Excuse me, I'm talking.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,711
His father is suffering from Alzheimer's.
He's not aware that he is his son. Or who's arround him.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,792
- What difference does it make to him? 
 Whether it's you or someone else?
- Why do you say that? it matters.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,678
Does he understand that you're his son?

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,677
But I know he is my father.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,751
Is you daughter not imprtant to you? 
Her future is not important to you?

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,595
- Who said this is about our daughter?
- All these other children...
- Why do you think it's only important to you?

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,831
All these other children living in this country,
Do none of them have a future, Ma'am?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,276
I'd prefer that my child didn't grow up under these
circumstances. As a mother, I have this right.

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,271
Under what conditions?
Which conditions, Ma'am?

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,390
Is it better growing up here with both parents, or 
growing up over there with no father?

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,875
That's exactly why I want him to come with us.

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,749
I'm not in a situation that I could come.
How many times do I have to repeat this? 
Did I need to say again?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,709
So he doesn't have the conditions.
What will happen to me now?

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,990
Nothing. 
Return to your life.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,311
If we could, I wouldn't have applied for divoce.

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,399
Ma'am, he also has to approve of this divorce.
It has to be mutual.

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,597
- But, he is saying he's willing.
Isn't he saying that he's ok right now?
- Sir, are you willing to divorce?

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,229
If she prefers going abroad to leaving the father of her child,
then I'm ok.

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,597
Ok, so he's fine.
What about my daughter?

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,076
Everything has to be agreed upon.
How old is your daughter?

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,475
She'll be 11 in two weeks.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,200
If her father doesn't give permission, 
she can't come with you, Ma'am.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,197
Her father doen't allow.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,152
That's between you two.

56
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,629
Please sign here and have a good day.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,234
Judge, I've come here so you can
solve my problem.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,356
You too please.
Come sign here.

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,193
- Where do I sign?
- Here.

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,437
I'll give up everything.
Just give me my daughter.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,354
Your daughter is emotionaly attached to me.
She doesn't even want to come with you.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,750
- She doesn't understand.
- Why do you say she doesn't understand?

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,632
She's 11. Why doesn't she understand?

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,429
Please sign here, 
and don't take up the time of the court.

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,274
- No one understands but you.
- No, it's just you that understands evertyhing...
- Please don't take up the court's time.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,352
Judge, what do I do?
I only have 40 days left.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,556
Ma'am, you can just come here everytime 
you have a small issue and want to get divorce.

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,113
Small issue?

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,753
My problem is not small.

70
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,068
- My problem is not small.
- Thank you

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,028
- The problem is my daughter.
- Ma'am, it's his daughter too. 
He has rights too.

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,998
I'm the judge and I'm saying that your issue is small.

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,873
Sign here please and have a good day.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,830
Separation of Nader from Simin
A film by Asghar Farhadi

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,310
- Ma'am, you said second floor.
- This IS the second floor, Sir.

76
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,032
Then what's the lower floor?

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,391
This is ground, this is first,
and that would be the second floor.

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,353
Our price was for two floors.

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,392
- You're getting paid by the buyer, anyway.
- But only for two floors though.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,076
I don't understand what you're saying, Sir.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,194
Then call the buyer to see what we have to do.
This isn't right, this is three floors.

82
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,838
I'll pay for the extra floor.
Just open the way for me.

83
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,070
Excuse me, Ma'am?

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,912
Go tell your dad that they're late.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,399
Why don't you tell him yourself?

86
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,038
- What did I say?
- What was our deal?

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,036
I'm studying.

88
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,638
- Hello.
- Hello, Ma'am.

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,473
I'll be right with you.

90
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,354
Ma'am, I do not know how much you're aware of this, but,

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,551
it's for taking care of my father 
that I'm bothering you with.

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,759
It'll be some home job too, 

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,516
but the real issue is that you
have to give him the meds on time.

94
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,311
... doesn't use the stove, doesn't open this door,
so he'd go out and get lost. Doesn't open the window.

95
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,550
I'll have to go to work at 7:30 am.
You should be here then so I can leave right after.

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,518
7:30 is too early.

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,797
If I were to come then, 
I'd have to leave home around 5:00 - 5:30am
- Can you do eight?

98
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,672
- Come on up

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,753
- I don't know about 8.
- It'd be fine if you could get here by 8:00.

100
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,749
Ring our neighbour's house, they'll open
the front door. I'll leave the keys here.

101
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,990
- OK?
- OK.

102
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,948
- Can you get to it? - Yes
- Sorry, what's the monthly rate?

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,639
Just one sec...

104
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,314
- 300,000 per month, Ma'am.
- That's too little.

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,477
No, it's around that price, ask around.

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,033
My commute is too far.

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,473
I have to change a couple of buses to get here.

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,392
Look, this is what I can afford.
Now, you know better whether you'd like to take the offer.

109
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,152
Give these books to her, she might need them.

110
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,880
- I don't have change, Ma'am.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,116
- So let me know by this afternoon so
I can let someone else know.

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,196
So if you couldn't do it, I'd wouldn't lose them.

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,514
OK.

114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,513
Termeh! Your clothes!

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,958
Not coming?

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,951
- Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

117
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,074
All this for only two weeks?

118
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,551
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

119
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,712
- Usually, what does she put it on?
- Should I go ask her?

120
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,759
You want to make me look bad before your mom's even left?

121
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,872
- Simin, where are you going?
- I'll be back soon.

122
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,316
- Where are you going?
- Going up the street.
I have something to do; be right back.

123
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,632
I'll be back.

124
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,276
I have an appointment.

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,989
- I say put it on Four.
- Why four?

126
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,351
Because it's most faded.

127
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,475
See, mom must have use that number most 
since its color has faded so much.

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,190
OK, we'll do four then; who cares...

129
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,078
In fact, from now on we'll put
all the settings of this house on four.

130
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,677
She's really going.

131
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,752
- She'll be back, dear.
- Termeh!

132
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,115
Come here to Grandpa.

133
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,830
Dad?

134
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,677
Honey, go to your room.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,470
Dad, get up.
Let go of her hand.

136
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,358
Let go of her hand.
Get up, I want to take you to the toilet.
Get up dad.

137
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,230
Where are you taking me?

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,437
The toilet and then I want to
go buy you newspaper.

139
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,196
Honey, I said go to your room.
I told you to go, dear.

140
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,190
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

141
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,196
Don't put your hand there.

142
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,310
I'm taking this Shajarian CD.

143
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,194
- Take whichever you want.
- No, just this one.

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,992
Good-bye.

145
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,793
I thought you were living there too.

146
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,076
No, I'll be moving into my mother's for a while.

147
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,790
It's a bit difficult.

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,838
Look, I fully trust him in those cases.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,991
He's a devoted man. Don't worry about him.

150
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,670
Plus, he won't even be home.

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,309
In the morning when you get there, 
he'll be off to work.

152
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,073
The same in afternoon.

153
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,196
Your daughter will be there too.
That way my daughter won't be alone either.

154
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:56,398
They'll play together. 

155
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,230
Where are you going?

156
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,198
What is this?
- Oxygen.

157
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,952
What is oxygen?

158
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,036
Get away.
or he'll wake up.

159
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,317
I can't hear anything.

160
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,272
What is he doing?

161
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,799
Hello.

162
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,952
Did you want to go somewhere?

163
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,190
- I wanna buy a newspaper.
- What?

164
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,149
I want to buy a newspaper.

165
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,870
There is newspaper in your room. 
Come.

166
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,676
Come, let me take you to your room.

167
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,748
I want to take you to your room,
then give you something to eat.

168
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,676
Mom!

169
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,191
He's peed his pants.

170
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,397
Sit on the bed.

171
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,716
What is this?

172
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,839
Where are you going? Get inside.

173
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,357
Go wear a shoes.
You see it's all Najes (unclean) here.

174
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,157
He'd say if he had to pee.

175
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,990
Look, take him into the bathroom...

176
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,159
I can't come now.
I have classes til 12:00.

177
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,952
Call my husband. Have you called him?
Do you have his number?

178
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,955
Write it then.

179
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,515
Pen's right there by the phone.

180
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,076
If I brouhgt you a pants, could you change yourself?

181
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,078
Your clothing. If I brought your cloth,
could you change yourself?

182
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,513
- Simin?
- Can you wash yourself?

183
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,631
- Wash yourself?
- Simin?

184
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,555
I'm leaving your clothe here. Ok?

185
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,113
Wash yourself, then wear these clothes.

186
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,549
I'm putting your towel here.

187
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,638
- Understand?
- Yes.

188
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,119
Wash yourself so you won't be uncomfortable.

189
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,190
Put your pants in there.

190
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,352
Can you?

191
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,433
Your pants! Tkae them off.

192
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,393
And wear the one I gave you.

193
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,714
OK?

194
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,791
Simin...

195
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,713
Hello.
I have a question.

196
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,512
I've come here to this house for work.
I have to look after an elderly man.

197
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,512
I wanted to ask...

198
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,036
Excuse me, but he peed his pants.

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,788
I was wondering if I changed him myself,
Would it be a sin? would it not?

200
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,399
No one's here.

201
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,675
old man, 70 or 80 years of age with dementia ...

202
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,710
The urine... 
He's been sitting here for half an hour now.

203
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,632
Can I?

204
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,710
I won't tell dad.

205
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,552
My dear.

206
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,113
Get up.

207
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,309
Open your legs.

208
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,518
OK, now remove your pants.

209
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,715
Card!

210
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,915
- Everybody is looking.
- That's ok, let them look.

211
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,238
- How much?
- 37.5

212
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,038
- Did you get the rest?
- He didn't give.

213
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,476
- You asked and he didn't give?
- That was his tip.

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,752
Tip?
A second, sir!

215
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,630
Tip is for when he's doing the job.
Go take the money.

216
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,034
- Dad!
- Quick!

217
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,633
Wait, Sir, wait.

218
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,835
- Here.
- It's yours.

219
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,118
Really?

220
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,036
- Hello.
- Hello, Termeh.

221
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,394
Hello, Ma'am.

222
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,199
- Hello, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

223
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,315
- I'll just bring my books.
- Bring the test results as well.

224
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,754
- How are you, Mrs. Qahraei?
- I'm fine, thanks, you?

225
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,148
I'm fine, thank you.

226
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,952
Sorry we're late.

227
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,593
No problem.
How's your wife?

228
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,836
- Well, thank you.
- Great.

229
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,596
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.

230
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,479
How are you doing, Dad?

231
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,429
- Hello, pretty lady.
- Hello.

232
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,438
Here's the newspaper.

233
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,674
Are you reading him the newspaper or is he to you?

234
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,273
Son ...

235
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,952
Ali got married.

236
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,792
- who's Ali?
- Ali.

237
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,749
Yeah, Ali got married.
Termeh, quick.

238
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,071
Ma'm, you hadn't closed his oxygen valve very tight.

239
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,759
I did in the morning, he probably opened it himself.

240
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,193
Could you tighten it a bit more from
tomorrow so he can't open it.

241
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,828
I'm sorry but...

242
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,796
I don't think I can come tomorrow.

243
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,352
Didn't you say you'd come every day?

244
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,397
I did but my distance is too far. I can't come.

245
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,279
Ma'am, I had to turned someone 
else away yesterday because of you. 

246
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,317
It's 4 in the afternoon.
Where would I find someone else for tomorrow?

247
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,469
I swear, it's really difficult for me.

248
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,077
I really can't.
The job is very heavy, I can't do.

249
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,116
Please, could you come here?

250
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,588
- Somayeh, where is your scarf?
- it's here.

251
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,190
Maybe you got tired cause it's the first day.

252
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,079
No.

253
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,833
You've been here yourself... seen those few minutes.

254
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,158
Somayeh, come get your bag.

255
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,435
Sorry, if you could give me that number...

256
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,358
They also have ultrasound.

257
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,474
- Today he was moving alot.
- So it's a boy.

258
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,194
This morning he was kicking my mom's belly so much...

259
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,794
Well, he wants to be born sooner...

260
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,359
To play with me.

261
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,154
Could you write here, please?

262
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,910
Tell them Qahraei sent you.

263
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,599
Her secretary knows me.

264
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,991
- Is it a man or a women?
- It's a women.

265
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,436
Do call in advance.

266
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,596
You should have told me about this yesterday, Ma'am.

267
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,473
How can I leave him alone in the house tomorrow?

268
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,439
- Termeh, where did your mom leave the tea bags?
- I don't know.

269
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,475
You should have also told me 
that I have to clean him too.

270
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,233
What cleaning?

271
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,871
This morning he peed his pants.

272
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,635
It's not correct for me to clean him.

273
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,353
Could you pay me for today,
So I can go.

274
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,194
Always told us when he had to pee.

275
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,035
If you call these companies, they can
send you male caregivers too.

276
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,672
Ma'am, I can't just trust anybody.

277
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,155
Here.
You can count if you'd like.

278
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,037
Sorry, I'm only saying this 
causue of the religious issues.

279
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,269
No problem.

280
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,998
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

281
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,355
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

282
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,435
Yes?

283
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,751
Sorry, I was wondering if I can
give your number to my husband, 

284
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,957
saying I found you in the newspaper...

285
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,758
For these household chores and for your father.

286
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,198
You can describe the job, and if he
agrees to come ...

287
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,197
I don't want to tell him that I know you.

288
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,158
I didn't tell him that I was coming here for work.

289
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,634
So, tell him to call me or just
tell him to come here tonight.

290
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,552
I think it'll be too late for tonight.

291
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,711
So, I'll come in tomorrow myself.

292
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,036
If you could just not give the job to someone else.

293
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,714
And you know better about the rate...

294
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,752
Don't worry about that. Have him call me
and I will setup to meet him.

295
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,314
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, bye.

296
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,999
And thanks.

297
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,479
Mr Lavasani?

298
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,199
There.

299
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,153
Hello. I'm Samadi.

300
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,918
- I called for the job.
- Yes, how are you?

301
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,308
I'm sorry I'm late.

302
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,869
No problem.
Where did you say you worked before?

303
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,353
Shoe repair.

304
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,590
So, you don't have any issue with cleaning him?

305
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,670
What?

306
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,990
I said, he can't hold since yesterday.

307
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,549
No, it's okay, he's like my own father.

308
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,150
So, since you're going to be alone with him, 
with no one else, you have to be very careful.

309
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,719
Will the family not be there?

310
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,398
No, I'm single now.

311
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,640
Excuse me, but 300,000
for this job, is itn't too little?

312
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,472
How much did you have in mind?

313
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,990
- Perhaps 400,000 at least
- I really can't do 400.

314
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,759
I'll come in a few of days for test...

315
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,393
If you liked, add something to it.

316
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,836
- If you weren't satisfied
then just don't pay.

317
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,718
If you want I could start today.

318
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,759
No, I have someone today.
Bring an identification card and start tomorrow.

319
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,515
- Like what?
- A picture ID is sufficient.

320
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,150
- Religiosity?
- Believer.

321
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,195
- Arid?
- Sand pile.

322
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,356
- The desert?
- The desert.

323
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,955
- A riot?
- Rebellion.

324
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,833
The door-bell?

325
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,718
- Razieh.
- No.

326
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,478
- Her husband.
- Yes.

327
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,153
Give the farsi version of the following words:

328
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,758
- Model?
- Nemunak.

329
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,430
- Compost?
- Khoshaab.

330
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,558
- Warranty?
- Compensation, zemanat.

331
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,272
That's Arabic, not farsi.

332
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,072
My teacher said so.

333
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,550
Don't tell that again.

334
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,911
What is wrong is wrong.
No matter who says or where it's written.

335
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,988
- For "warranty", you can write...
- If I write anything else, they'll take points off.

336
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,435
That's ok, let them.

337
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,591
... Write "Poshtvaneh".

338
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,478
Poshtvaneh.

339
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,552
Hello.

340
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,277
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,239
What happened? I thought your husband
was supposed to come from today.

342
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,317
Sorry, he couldn't come today.

343
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,158
What about tomorrow?

344
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,954
I do not know.
If not, I'll come myself.

345
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,190
Ma'am, is he going to come one day 
and not show up another...

346
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,953
No, the poor man wanted to come.

347
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,993
Last night one of the lenders came with the
police and took him away.

348
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,512
In any case, if he can't make it, I need to know 
a couple of days in advance.

349
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,232
No, he'll definitely come.

350
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,636
Tonight, I want to go to this lender,
beg him so he'd let him come out.

351
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,474
Please lock the door behind me.
- Sure - Bye.

352
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,192
Hi.

353
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,072
Don't step on it, it's Najes.

354
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,631
Go take the trash out.

355
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,478
Are you able to?

356
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,714
Yeah, I can.

357
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,395
Where the hell do I find you clothes now?

358
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,272
Take off the top one.

359
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,599
Take it off.

360
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,039
Mom...

361
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,588
He's not in his room.

362
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,154
- What?
- He's not in his room.

363
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,556
Go see if he's in the toilet.

364
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,193
Put your hand here.

365
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,519
Don't move it, okay?
The ball won't get pass here...

366
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,798
Nice going dad.

367
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,838
- Grandpa , which side are you on?
- He's the manager, sitting on the side-bench.

368
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,199
Did you see that?

369
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,469
What happened?

370
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,158
Sit down.

371
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,357
Are you all right?

372
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,713
Where have you been, girl?

373
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,997
The poor man's been waiting for you for half an hour.

374
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,798
I have a long commute, I swear.

375
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,712
Hello.

376
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,954
Also, if you could take the trash
in the trash bin.

377
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,674
The wetness of the bags get on 
the stairs, making them dirty.

378
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,752
Yesterday I got dizzy and 
dropped the bag. It got ripped open.

379
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,273
I'll clean the stairs today.

380
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,109
- OK
- Get in.

381
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,878
Move your hand away.

382
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,192
Let me close the door.

383
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,636
- Ma'am?
- Not here?

384
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,868
- What was her child's name?
- Somayeh.

385
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,437
Don't sit there, it's wet. You see...

386
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,479
Somayeh!

387
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,678
Somayeh!
Ring the bell.

388
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,151
Ms. Khalani!

389
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,954
Keep knocking.

390
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,795
Somayeh! Grandpa!

391
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,754
Ms. Khalani!

392
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,195
Yes.

393
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,236
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

394
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,233
- Have you seen the lady who works with us?
- She was cleaning the stairs.

395
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,635
- When?
- Morning.

396
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,753
- She's not home?
- No. Thank you.

397
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,673
You wait here.
I'll go get the keys out of the car.

398
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,193
What happened?

399
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,715
Dad?

400
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,312
Get the feet, Honey.

401
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,834
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

402
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,709
Dad!

403
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,158
He's breathing.
Don't worry, he's breathing.

404
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,790
Do your arms hurt?
Take his shirt off.

405
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,878
Move your arms.

406
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,958
Does it hurt?
Get up.

407
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,310
Walk a little.
Come on.

408
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,395
Come on, let's go get a newspaper.

409
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,159
Move your leg.

410
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,633
Does it hurt?
Let me see what happened?

411
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,675
Who did this to you, dad?

412
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,914
I want to make sure your legs are ok, dad!

413
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,312
Let me...
Honey, can you go outside.

414
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,795
- Is something wrong?
- No, you it's fine. Go out.

415
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,753
She's gone, daddy. 
Let me take them off.

416
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,394
Dad! I want to make sure your legs are ok.

417
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,478
Come on, remove it.

418
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,511
Bastard

419
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,395
- Honey, did you take some money
from the drawer? - No.

420
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,873
Go to the kitchen.

421
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,557
Honey, dear, I told you to go to the kitchen.

422
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,950
Didn't you see it was nothing?

423
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,514
Come on ... Close the door.

424
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,519
Hello.

425
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,593
Come here.

426
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,392
Mom, I'm thirsty.

427
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,392
You look at him.

428
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,914
Hello.

429
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,277
Where were you?

430
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,919
I had something to do; I went away
for a moment and came back.

431
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,196
The hell you went away for a moment...

432
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,358
- He was asleep.
- So, you had to lock the door on him and leave?

433
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,799
I came back quickly...

434
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,309
Came back quickly?
How can you look into my eyes and lie?

435
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,590
He was dying when I got here!

436
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,035
He always sleeps this time ...

437
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,628
So you do this everyday then?

438
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,876
You lock the door and
get on to your own business?

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,831
No, I swear. I had to do it today.

440
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,190
- Why did you tie his hand?
- Go wait outside.

441
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,270
Was this our agreement? Was it?

442
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,830
I had to.
I had something I had to do.

443
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,109
Thank you very much!

444
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,113
Our agreement was to tie this poor mans hand
and lock the door and go on to your life?

445
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,879
- Now, what's happned to him? is he okay?
- Thank you very much.

446
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,430
You wait outside, honey.
Go make sure grandpa doesn't need anything.

447
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,637
What'd you need in that
room over there?

448
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,276
Which room?

449
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,677
Which room?
The room you took money from its drawer.

450
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,036
I've taken money from your drawer?

451
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,555
- I've taken money from your drawer?
- You haven't taken money?

452
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,680
I swear I did not!

453
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,071
- I swear I would never do such thing!
- Come on, come on, Get out.

454
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,589
Sir, to our martyrs
I swear.

455
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,398
You're saying I took money? ...

456
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:16,517
Well, here's my bag. Look.
If I'd taken money then 
it'd have to be in here.

457
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,119
Here, honey take his bag.

458
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,799
Where are you taking the bag, Sir?
Give it back.

459
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,158
I'm swearing to Emam Zaman...

460
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,834
- Here's my bag.
- Ma'am, why are you doing this?

461
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,791
I'm saying I swear to Emam Zaman...

462
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,833
I'm saying I swear to Emam Zaman if I've
steped one inch from here.

463
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,190
- Get out.
- You say... What have I done?

464
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,191
Don't touch me, SIR!

465
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,313
OK, I won't touch.
Just get out yourself.

466
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,355
- GET OUT!
I won't go until I get my money.

467
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,193
You deserve to be kicked/thrown out of here.

468
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,477
- WHAT have I done?
- Look at me. It's for her
 sake I'm letting you go easy. Understand?

469
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,915
Get out.

470
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,036
- I'm being nice to you to just throw you out.
- Tell me what happened to him.

471
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,518
Ma'am, this is my home,
I want you to get out of here.
- Ok I'll get out.

472
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,756
But this is not right.

473
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,190
- But this is not right.
- Please get out!

474
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,874
That's it.

475
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,319
Dad?

476
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,877
Open the door. It's me.
I want to get in ...

477
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,275
Is this how your looking after him?

478
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,798
Dad, open the door.

479
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,112
See what's over there.
Take a look.

480
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,079
Open the door!

481
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,879
Why are you shouting? 
He won't understand.

482
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,428
When I tell to be careful, it's for this.

483
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,273
Maybe his leg hurs and can't get up.

484
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,154
Grandpa ...

485
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,914
Dad, open the door.

486
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,158
Open the door, please.

487
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,998
Dad, I'm gonna push the door to get in.

488
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,109
It'll hit you, dad.
Move over.

489
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,432
I'm gonna push the door to get in.

490
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,550
Why are you doing this yourself?

491
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,792
Who told you to enter in?

492
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,514
- I wanted to see what happened to him.
- Give me the keys and get out!

493
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,910
- I did not steal anything from you.
- Ma'am, you're really getting me angry!

494
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,995
I did not steal.

495
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,469
- Don't explain! Don't explain!
- I wasn't here, Sir.

496
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,318
Get out.

497
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,038
Give me my money for today and I'll go.

498
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,833
Havent you already taken it!
haven't you?

499
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,036
I'v been here since 5:30 in the morning with my daughter...
Somayeh.

500
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,674
- Get out! Get out!
Sir, stop! stop!

501
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,991
- Out!
- I swear if I stole anything.

502
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,310
Get outta here, I said.

503
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,272
What happened?

504
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,514
What happened?

505
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,468
Sit down.

506
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,199
What happened, Ma'am?

507
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,750
Mom, be careful.

508
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,671
Tell her to work on your english.

509
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,319
Good-bye, Grandpa.

510
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,110
Dad, Termeh said goodbye.

511
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,039
Be careful.

512
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,199
OK.

513
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,798
- What happened?
- Mom says come in.

514
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,432
Tell her grandpa's in the car,
I can't come.

515
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,357
Says it's important.

516
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,398
You've stopped keeping up with us,
even before divorcing your wife... 

517
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,590
I'm really busy, mother.

518
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,719
People divorce their wives to 
become less busy.

519
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,553
Ma'am, I can get these channels,
They probably have parazit (static).

520
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,354
Dear, just fix the ones that work.

521
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,670
- Come, sit down.
- Thank you. Simin?

522
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

523
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,279
Where's Termeh?

524
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,117
- With my dad in the car.
- Well, bring your dad in too.

525
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,033
No, he's tired.
It's his sleep time.

526
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,959
What?

527
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,549
Did you fight with that lady today?

528
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,799
- She came to you?
- Her sister in law called me.

529
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,639
Shameless!

530
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,233
What'd she do?

531
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,472
Tied the old man to bed,


532
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,993
locked the door, left the house...

533
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,072
If I had come in 10 min later,
it'd be done.

534
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,958
- Is he ok?
- He'd fallen out of bed.

535
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,429
Who knows how how long he was like that.

536
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,034
- Where was she?
- I don't know where the hell she went.

537
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,158
- She said you hit her.
- I hit her?

538
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,909
- Nonsense.
- So why have they taken her to the hospital?

539
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,955
- Hospital? Why? What happend to her?
- You're asking me?

540
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,398
- I just pushed so she'd get out of the house.
- Her sister in law called and scolded me.

541
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,473
- What she say? - That if she dies, the blood
will be on your hands.

542
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,958
Things like that.

543
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,756
- Did she say what happened?
- I hung up. She started to curse.

544
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,796
This is what happends when you just 
find random people.

545
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,629
Don't blame me.
I told you even then that I only know
the sister in law.

546
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,036
Did she say which hospital?

547
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,591
- Hi Ma'am.
- Yes?

548
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,394
Please wait.

549
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,995
A women with the name "Razieh" 
was brough in this evening.

550
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,277
- What was the last name?
- We don't know; 
She must have been brought in early evening.

551
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,913
Why was she brought in?

552
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,077
- We were just told...
- That she had gotten sick.

553
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,835
I'll call you.
Bye.

554
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,350
If I'm not mistaking,
her husband's name is Samadi.

555
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,515
- Razieh Asnaqi?
- Is she about thirty?

556
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,156
She's had an surgery and now 
she's in post-operative care.

557
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,912
What surgery?

558
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,432
She had a miscarriage.

559
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,834
- Is she ok now?
- Hello? Wait. She's fine.

560
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,714
Excuse me, is there any family member here?

561
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,797
- They'd be downstairs.
- Thank you

562
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,710
What did you do to her?

563
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,716
What did I do?

564
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,553
Hello, Sir.

565
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,196
- How are you?
- We're fine, thank you.

566
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,714
Hello, Ma'am.

567
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,229
- How is she?
- Who?

568
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,239
Your wife.

569
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,318
Under care.

570
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,158
Did you know her?

571
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,151
- I did.
- My wife did.

572
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,989
- Didn't have any sandwiches.
- Hello, Ma'am.

573
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,357
- Can we visit her?
- Where did you know her from?

574
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,913
- Your sister had introduced her 
to us for household chores.
- Thank you very much.

575
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,272
- She came to your house for work?
- A few days she came, yes.

576
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,716
You were busy apparently, 
so she came in for you.

577
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,392
Sit down and eat something.

578
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,353
You mean she came to look after your father?

579
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,153
Only a few days.

580
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,994
Two or three days.

581
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,277
Then why didn't you tell me that in the bank
the other day?

582
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,800
I thought she would have told you already.

583
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,200
Now, why did you come here?

584
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,031
- We thought we'd come to see
if there is anything we could do.
- What work?

585
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,430
- Any help... we were worried.

586
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,073
She fell down?

587
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,195
Look, come with me so I can explain.

588
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,716
Let me explain... Come with me.

589
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,037
I really understand your situation.

590
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,192
You've killed his child,
now you've come to bring it back to life?

591
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,437
- I'm really sorry.
- Sorry won't become her child, Ma'am.

592
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,160
Tell me one thing only.
Why didn't you tell me that day?

593
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,878
I thought she...

594
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,396
Sir, my friened!
You're single... my wife...

595
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,630
Let go of my hand...

596
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,632
Let him go

597
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,634
Let it go.
Calm down. Please...

598
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,631
This is a hospital.
Come on.

599
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,114
Stop, Sir! Stop!

600
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,790
Why did you come here?

601
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,598
Let me see.

602
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,157
- You had to tell me this tonight?
- I'm so sorry.

603
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,356
- Let me see.
- I'm sorry.

604
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,673
Come out here.
Come out here.

605
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,317
Come out, I wanna talk to you.

606
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,029
Please, I beg you, Hojjat!

607
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,434
- Do you want me to lower your seat?
- No.

608
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,754
I'll leave you home, then I'll go
pick up my father.

609
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,513
No.

610
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,953
What you do mean no?

611
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,315
You want to go to your parents
looking this way?

612
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,829
It's done.
Tonight you come back home.

613
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,193
I don't want to.

614
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,318
Where're you going, Sir?

615
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,070
Leave it there.

616
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,476
Did you hear her accusation?
Do you agree?

617
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,874
It's was the 13th, sir.

618
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,838
I'm sorry for her and I got very sad
 when I heard about it...

619
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,992
- I went to the hospital.
- So you agree that you did it?

620
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,158
Did you get this the same day 
from the medical examiner?

621
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,758
The night she was in hospital,
we took the report for the ...
We took it to the examiner.

622
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,670
Four and a half months, boy.
So, please explain.

623
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,310
I agree,
I got a bit rough with her.

624
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,998
What do you mean rough,
Did you push her?

625
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,954
No, I didn't push her.
I just tried to get her out of the house.

626
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,952
No, please explain more clearly, Sir.
You are accused of murder right now.

627
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,280
The kid was 4.5 months, 
hence is considered a complete human.

628
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,154
I didn't approach her with
the intention of pushing her.

629
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,351
I just wanted her to get out
so I could close the door.

630
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,240
- You didn't push me?
- Madam, please.

631
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,118
If I had known she was pregnant ...

632
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,913
I wounldn't have even done as much as I did.

633
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,070
I just wanted to close the door.

634
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,311
Do you agree with his words, Ma'am?

635
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,308
He didn't push me, he grabbed me here
and then threw me; I fell down the stairs.

636
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,715
No, I didn't throw you.

637
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,275
I just said, I just wanted to 
get her out of my home.

638
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,472
- Who throws a pregnant woman out his house?
- I didn't know she was pregnant.

639
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,074
- Why are you lying?
- I just learned this in the hospital.

640
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,236
Judge, you're like my older brother.
How can someone not figure out from 
the look of a pregnant woman?

641
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,278
- A 4.5 month pregnant lady.
- Ma'am, when did I even got to see you?

642
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,440
By the time you showed up,
I was either gone or about to go to work.

643
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,956
And when I returned, she was always like this,
with the chador on.

644
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,508
How could anyone figure out she was pregnant?

645
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,830
He could claim not to have known 
from your physical apperance.

646
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,120
Plus, I never even imagined a 
pregnant women would do such a work.

647
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:31,470
Judge, I spoke about my pregnancy in front
of him, his doaugher and her teacher.

648
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,640
- I swear they all heard.
- When? I don't remember.

649
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,509
- Of course you wouldn't remember...
- Who says this is about my knowledge of this anyway?

650
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,068
Of course it is.
If they can prove that you
knew she was prenant...

651
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,038
... The court will give you
 1 to 3 years in jail.

652
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,436
- So?
- What?

653
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,470
- No, I did not know.
- Your daughter's teacher can testify.

654
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,993
Can she come tomorrow?

655
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,958
Sir, I don't even want to ger her involved.

656
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,860
It's not good for my kid.

657
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,429
Asshole, you killed my kid.
Now it's bad for your kid?

658
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,318
Your kid is just important?
Our kids are animals?

659
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,549
Don't insult, Sir.

660
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,916
I'm insulting? or is he?
When he takes my pregnant wife for stupid work ...

661
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,991
Be quiet or I'll send you to jail for three days.

662
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,914
- Please, he just gets angry too quick.
- Ma'am, did I make you do this?

663
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,753
I should really be complaining from her for why she
would go work for this guy without my knowledge.

664
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,150
When you go to work in a single man's house,
and you don't even know who he is...

665
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,232
I wanted to help with the bills.
Judge, he's been umemployed for a couple fo months.

666
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,110
In any case, the teacher has to come as a witness.
Either call her yourself or give us the contacts...

667
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,195
Judge, I am here today
just for one thing.

668
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,196
I lost my kid, but I didn't get as disheartened ...

669
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,788
As when this guy accused me of stealing.

670
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,233
We're thieves?
- Please sit down.

671
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,518
If we were thieves, would 
we come clean your father's ass?

672
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,191
- Do you have proof that she's stolen?
- Sir, I didn't say she stole.

673
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,796
I looked in the drawer, and saw 
that there was money missing;
Exactly the amount she was gonna get.

674
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,360
- Is that why you got into a fight?
- He accused her of theft.

675
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,352
Judge, my father is suffering from Alzheimer's.

676
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,069
This women tied him to bed and locks the door
and leaves the house.

677
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,196
That day I came home early.

678
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,240
I saw him tied to the bed, in a terrible situation...
I thought he was dead at first.

679
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,074
She came back and in that situation
 I can't say I wasn't angry. I was angry.

680
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,080
I told her to get out of the house,
 but she wouldn't get out.

681
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,436
Where was I suppose to go?
This guy accused me of theft.

682
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,628
If I hadn't requested that he pay
me and just left, he would have 
thought I had stolen the money.

683
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,393
- Sit down.
- Was your father injured?

684
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,550
- Yes, he was injured a bit.
- What injury?

685
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,835
If he had injury then this 
guy would have to be the one complaning.

686
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,592
Yes, he was injured.

687
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,151
- Where are you going, Ma'am?
- Sorry, my kid is outside, 
just going to have a look at her.

688
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,956
Come back soon.
And close the door.

689
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,551
Where'd you go? Why aren't you coming back?

690
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,916
I'm not feeling good.
You go, I'll come.

691
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,070
He's saying you locked his 
father in the house and left.

692
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,879
What can I say?

693
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,557
What do you mean?
If the complaint goes though, 
they'll have a ruling against you.

694
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,675
- Where's Somayeh?
- There.

695
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,070
You go, I'll bring her.

696
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,149
Lets go.

697
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,993
Yes?

698
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,792
He was asleep. I locked the 
door so he wouldn't get out.

699
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,999
This guy himself locked the door these couple of days,
and left the key for me.

700
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,111
I saw that he was doing it himself...

701
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,997
He says you tied him to the bed.

702
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,192
I was afraid if he woke up, 
He'd get out of the bed and do something to himself.

703
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,474
- Judge, I swear I did it cause I cared.
- Ma'am, the real issue is why did you leave the house?

704
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,949
- She left; you have to hit her?
- Quiet!

705
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,758
Who even let you touch my wife?

706
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,955
Sir, get out.

707
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,712
Sir, if they don't care abut honor,
I care.

708
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,958
- Sir, please don't insult.
- Please leave the room.

709
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,078
Sir, I want to make a complaint against this woman now.

710
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,997
Write the complaint and bring to me.

711
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,112
Take your father to the medical examiner
and have them write a report.

712
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,392
- Excuse me, what happenes to our complaint?
- You just sign here and get out.

713
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,792
Call someone for the bail.

714
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,313
What bail?

715
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,673
Your accused of murder.
I can't just let you leave.

716
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,595
40 million is blood money.
Sign here.

717
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,756
Judge, Where can I find bail?

718
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,794
I'm living in my father's house.
And he has Alzheimer's.

719
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,679
If you can't, you'll go to jail.

720
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,590
My father can't come here with his sickness.
Sir, don't write please...

721
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,950
Please. I beg.
I can't go to jail.

722
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,278
I've left my dad at home to come here.

723
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,592
I can't go to jail.
I really don't have the bail.

724
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,398
- It's not in my hand, it's the law.

725
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,240
Wait a bit. Let me...
My father, what do I do with him?

726
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,074
I've left my dad at home, locked him inside.

727
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,913
My daughter will be coming from school...
Please, don't write?

728
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,548
- What are writing?
- Why are wasting your time?
 go make the call.

729
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,393
I can't go to jail.
I won't go. You can write...

730
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,393
- Go get a soldier.

731
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,393
For what? Don't.
I'm begging you Sir.

732
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,356
Please don't write.
I swear my life will be ruined.

733
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,874
Don't waste your time.
Go make the call.

734
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,672
Termeh Hello, I've gotten tied down here.
They're keeping me tonight.

735
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,709
Don't you worry, it's nothing.
Just that you'll be alone tonight.

736
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,509
Keep an eye on everything. 
Remember to take Grandpa to the toilet.

737
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,875
Take care of yourself.
I will call tomorrow.

738
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,234
Hello.

739
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,516
If you hadn't left,
Dad wouldn't have been in jail now.

740
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,068
Your father isn't in jail because of me.

741
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,313
- He hit a pregnant lady.
- Cause you left that this women came here.

742
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,676
And how worried was your dad that I was leaving...

743
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,354
He knew that you wouldn't really go.

744
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,195
- Did you tell him?
- No, he figured out himself.

745
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,228
Tell me the truth.
Did you tell him?

746
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,114
Go get your stuff so we
can go to grandma's house.

747
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,589
- What about grandpa?
- We'll take him.

748
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,110
I have homework.
I'm not coming.

749
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,349
- I'll be leave you here alone!
- OK.

750
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,557
If you call me saying come get me,
You know what happens.

751
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,718
Didn't even once say: 
"Don't do it", "don't go",

752
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,470
"I won't divorce you".

753
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,270
Not as if we've lived together
for 14 years.

754
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,833
Dad!

755
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,597
What're you doing here, dear?

756
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,439
Who brought you here?

757
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,115
- Don't you have school? a test today?
- No, that's tomorrow.

758
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,111
Now, who brought you here?

759
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,598
Hello.

760
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,475
Shouldn't you call us, if you get into trouble?

761
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,318
... So we can bring you the house title as bail?

762
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,118
I didn't want to trouble you.

763
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,072
Silly man.

764
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,470
- Sit down.
- No Ma'am, I have to take him 
for question/answer.

765
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,711
- Where is grandpa?
- In safe hands. Don't worry.

766
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,869
What is their issue? saying: 'my child, my child'?

767
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,636
They say 'my child' as if it was their
18 year-old son who was stabbed to death.

768
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,712
- Did you talk with them?
- Well, you can't even talk to the guy.

769
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:40,913
I told the women: my dear, you're both young.
Next year, another child. Seriosly...

770
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,599
What happened?

771
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,359
- I have to get someone to value the home.
- OK, go.

772
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,075
- I'll be back.
- We'll be here. You Go.

774
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,959
Thank you.

775
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,000
- Hello, Mrs. Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

776
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,960
I'm fine, you?

777
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,997
- I'm sorry for your trouble.
- What trouble? It's good I saw you here...

778
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,629
What happend? Is it true that your husband...?

779
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,757
Yes, unfortunately, he pushed her
and she fell; then she had a miscarriage.

780
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,116
So, what do I have to answer?

781
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,708
I do not know what they're going to ask.

782
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,593
So, if they asked something that 
was disadvantages to your husband...?

783
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,070
In my opinion, you should tell them the truth.

784
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,199
- Ma'am, Please don't stop here.

785
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,437
- Where was he?
- Mr. Lavasani was in the kitchen.

786
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,356
- Any reactions to the conversation?
- If he did, I did not notice.

787
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,758
- How did you know she was pregnant?
- She told me herself, I think.

788
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,154
You asked, Ma'am.
Why would I say anything?

789
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,475
Aha.
Her daughter was drawing; a man and a women.

790
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,756
She said, this is my mother and my father.

791
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,752
I said: your mom's not that fat? 
She said that she was pregnant.

792
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,593
- So you didn't figure out based on her appearance?
- No.

793
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,708
Why are you lying, my sister?
You are a woman.

794
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,952
You really can't tell from the apperance 
of someone if they are pregnant?

795
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,511
Imagin I did figure out,
What difference does it make to Mr. Lavasani?

796
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,120
Judge, this woman is his daughter's teacher.
They've worked on their story together, I swear.

797
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,192
- Why are you insulting this lady?
- No one was talking to you.

798
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,069
When did I even have the opportunity
to get my story staight with her?

799
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,719
I was arrested here last night.

800
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,036
It's not very complicated.
Right now as I speak to you ...

801
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,034
That guy over there, even if he didn't want to,
could hear us, am I correct?

802
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,911
Ma'am, I didn't hear.
My mind was distracted with my own issues and problems.

803
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,632
Why would I listen to your private conversation?

804
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,232
- Do I have to swear on anything?
- As if you believe in God!

805
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,470
No, God is just for you people.

806
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,596
Please, open that window.

807
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,274
Judge, he is an honorable man.

808
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,079
I've been going to his house to teach his daughter for a year.

809
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,197
He'd never do such things.

810
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,034
I want to know: why would this
women hide her pregnancy from me?

811
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,913
If I had known she was pregnant,
I wouldn't have even hired her.

812
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,709
Why would you hired her when you know she hasn't
gotten permission from her husband?

813
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,916
Alright...
Thank you. You can go to.

814
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,149
Thank you.

815
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,119
In the Sassanid's time,
people were divided into two classes ...

816
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:20,510
... Privileged upper class and
the normal class.

817
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,598
"the normal folks".

818
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,033
What did they ask, Ma'am?

819
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,272
They wanted to know if your dad knew
Somayeh's mom was pregnant or not.

820
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,757
We're really sorry for your trouble.

821
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,559
Sure, no problem. I haven't done anyting.

822
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,034
Honey, what happend to your mom?

823
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,631
- She had a stomach ache.
- Why?

824
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,870
Did your father have a fight with her?

825
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,828
Why would they fight?

826
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,915
Maybe saying: why didn't you tell me 
that you were working at someone's house? 

827
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,312
- Did he hit her?
- My parents don't fight.

828
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:05,395
Then, why the day that you were drawing,
your parents were fighting?

829
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,513
- You showed it to me yourself.
- They don't fight anymore.

830
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,550
They haven't fought anymore?
Are you sure?

831
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,395
Yesterday he said 'I didn't know she was pregnant'...

832
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,120
Today he's saying 'I didn't even push her'.

833
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,634
And you just stand there quietly
and look at me.


834
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,712
Honestly, didn't you push me? Seriously...

835
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,358
- Haven't I already said it...
- Listen, Sir ...

836
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,296
Stop the 'I didn't push her but I 
got her out of the house' montra...

837
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,591
How far away is the door from the stairs,
two-three meters?

838
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,393
In this period, what else could have
happend to have cause her injury?

839
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,708
The hallway in our house ...

840
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,393
- Look ...
- I'm talking, Sir!

841
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,232
You should't be talking, you should be answering.
Just answer!

842
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,753
Be quiet!
- Did I jump into your...

843
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,635
You've come here to just answer.

844
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,070
- I have a question I want to ask you.
You just answer one question.
- OK.

845
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,635
- Judge, I want to ask him...
- Just go ahead and ask me directly...

846
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,877
If you havn't done anything wrong..

847
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,953
then why did you run to the hospital
to see what happened to my wife?
- I came as a gesture of kindness.

848
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,598
Where was your kindness when you were hitting her?

849
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,551
Was anybody else there
when you had the fight?

850
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,036
- Yeah, the neighbors were there.
- Ok, I'll send someone for investigation.

851
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,072
Judge, they too, will be like the teacher.
They're all toghether.

852
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,957
Judge, he's been insulting from the very beginning.

853
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,633
Am I lying?

854
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,440
- I'll be one saying who is telling the truth
and who is lying.

855
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,555
You be quite!

856
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,599
Sir, his wife that he's trying to get a 
divorce from has brought the bail.

857
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,800
My God!

858
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,835
Ma'am, do you have someone 
that'll be your guarantor?

859
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,149
What do you mean?

860
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,118
Like a civil servant, a business owner...

861
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,713
- No one. And my husband is unemployed.
- Why do we need a guarantor?

862
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,554
- You have to have a guarantor. She's now been charged.
- What is she charged with?

863
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,870
According to his application for a complaint ...

864
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,393
He has no right to.

865
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,990
She accepted that she tied his father to bed,
locked the door and left.

866
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,310
- I already explained ...
- Judge, her child died....

867
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,793
Keep your voice down.

868
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,796
Aren't you ashamed?
Are you a man?

869
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,359
- I said be quiet.

870
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,430
For God's sake, listen to us once.

871
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,150
He's distorting everything.
He's must have beaten up my wife
that the kid was...

872
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,113
What's more clear than this?
Why are you being unjust towards us?

873
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,236
Listen to me for once...

874
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,069
I've told you once; if you distrupt this meeting,
I will send you to jail for 3 days.

875
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,280
I've lost everything I have, Sir.
You're scaring me of jail? 

876
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,952
Go Fear God.

877
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,031
Mr. Izadi, call someone to come take this guy.

878
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,037
I'm begging, please don't call anyone.

879
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,149
- No, let me them come.
- Ok, get out of here and don't make noise.

880
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,437
Why should I be quite?
Should I be quite so they can take my rights?

881
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,754
Get out, Sir.

882
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,559
- What's your problem? I'm going...
- OK, get out.

883
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,515
Let me take my helmet.

884
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,835
He's going.

885
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,434
Judge, I worked 10 years in a shoe repair shop.

886
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,240
In the end, they throw me out like a dog.
Saying the law will give you your right.

887
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,395
I complained, it took a whole year.
In the end, nothing happend.

888
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,599
Go sit at home, they said.

889
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,673
But this time I won't let it happen again.
This time is different.

890
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,155
I have nothing to lose.

891
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,510
My problem is that I can't talk like this guy.

892
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,432
I get angry really quick. 
I can't talk like him.

893
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,158
- Don't do that!

894
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,472
- Hojjat?
- I don't feel good.

895
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,880
Go sit down for minute.

896
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,915
- Let's go!

897
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,754
- What do you want from him? He just gotten calm.
- We have to take him.

898
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,353
I want to talk to him for a sec.

899
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,550
Don't you move, OK?

900
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,476
Judge, I beg you.

901
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,272
Give me one second, Sir.

902
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,192
Sir, he's just under a lot of stress, I swear.

903
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,879
I tried not to say anything for two days...

904
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:46,895

905
01:10:46,899 --> 01:10:49,193
He's been in jail every other day in the last month, I swear.

906
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,359
All the lenders have been after him.
I've begged them all to let him out.

907
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,990
Sir, I'm begging you.
Look...

908
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,833
Look at these...

909
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,949
Sir, can I ask that you let go this time?

910
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:010,828
Sir, I swear he takes a whole bunch of these everyday.
I swear I'm not lying.
- Judge, Please.

911
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:16,635
Sir, since he's gotten unemployed,
he's become depressed. I swear, he can't control it.

912
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,798
Sir, you're like his older brother.

913
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,150

914
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,273
Go tell him to go find you a guarantor. Quick.

915
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,958
God bless. God bless you.

916
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,833
And don't leave the building.

917
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,315
No, I'll wait for him to return.
- Hello Sir.

918
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,158
Will you tell her?

919
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,397
She'll think now that she's brought me bail, 
I'm askig her to come back.

920
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,438
So let her think that way.

921
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,274
Dad ... please.

922
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,039
OK.

923
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,713
Promise me.

924
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,755
Why are you promising?

925
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,159
Dad ...

926
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,754
Yes?

927
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,155
You didn't know Razieh was pregnant?

928
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,994
No.

929
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,913
- Why?
- Nothing.

930
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,353
Then why'd you ask?

931
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,790
Last night mom said you knew.

932
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,674
Where was your mom to know whether I knew or not?

933
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,560
She said that night in the hospital,
when they said Razieh's baby had died ...

934
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,912
... You didn't say anything.

935
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,959
You didn't ask whether she was pregnant.
You weren't surprised.

936
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,389
In these situations, people would ask: 
did she have a baby?

937
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,072
As if you knew.

938
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,393
Your mom wants to make me look bad to you.

939
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,791
Will you tell her?

940
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,075
I couldn't, dear.

941
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,078
Didn't you promise?

942
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,873
I'm sorry.

943
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,194
- Which stair was she on?
- That one.

944
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,993
- This?
- This stair.

945
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,920
Can you take granpa in?
I'll be right in.

946
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,388
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

947
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,112
Did you go upstairs?

948
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,516
Yeah, I went to Mrs. Kalani's.

949
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,112
For what?

950
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,516
I told her that they'll be coming in for investigation tomotrow.
So she should be careful.

951
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,791
Careful for what?

952
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,676
Just be careful that they're coming in for investigation.
That's it.

953
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,712
Is that a problem?

954
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,557
If she's suppose to tell the truth,
why should she be careful?

955
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,517
- Termeh ...
- Yes?

956
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,993
Come with me.

957
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,589
- I have homeworl.
- Leave the homework. Come with me...

958
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,109
Come, assume you're that women.
See.

959
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,908
Is that right?
When someone gets thrown, they'll hit somewhere like this.

960
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,634
It won't be like this, then hit here, 
then come here, and spin around and hit here and fall here.

961
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,155
Right?

962
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,993
If I had thrown her...

963
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,357
... she would have either fallen on those stairs ...

964
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,194
... Or would have hit this directly.

965
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,192
You can't fall down here.

966
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,436
Assume that you got thrown, try it out.

967
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,472
- Then how did she fall over there?
- I don't know.

968
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,233
I'm just saying she wasn't thrown into these staires.
That's it.

969
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,112
You come here...

970
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,517
- Then why don't you  just tell them these things?
- Never mind them.

971
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,069
I want you to know.
Go on.

972
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,913
- He threw in this direction?
- No, right down the staires.

973
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,197
Look yourself! This door wouldn't even allow me.
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

974
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,713
It's not possible.

975
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,154
Where did you fall?

976
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,834
- On top of these stairs.
- Which one?

977
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,474
I think that one.

978
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,358
Do you think or are you sure?

979
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,359
I'm not sure.

980
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,590
Ma'am,
Did you find her right here?

981
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,992
I didn't see her getting thrown. 
When I arrived, she was on that stair.

982
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,118
Why don't you tell them anything?
Go show them how he threw you.

983
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,870
I was so sick, I swear I didn't
 even know what happened.

984
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,315
Look, I'll stand right here.

985
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,360
Sir, please stand right here,
push me with all your force.

986
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,033
I'm saying it's impossible to fall there.

987
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,680
Of course you won't fall.
She's was a pregnant woman; she'd
fall if you had just touched her.

988
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,150
Then you come.
Choose anybody you want to push you.

989
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,197
I'm saying it's not possible.

990
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,714
If you push from here,
You won't fall on that stair.

991
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,678
Which stair?
She's saying herself it's this stair.

992
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,633
Sir, everyone is saying they saw her on that stair.

993
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,870
Ma'am, did you see her getting thrown?

994
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,352
Yes. From above there, I couldn't see the house door,
but I could see the stairs that she fell on.

995
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,956
Can you show me where you were seeing this?

996
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,156
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.

997
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,028
How often did you use these stairs?
Why hadn't she gotten dizzy before?

998
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,829
Excuse me, Sir.
That morning when I saw her in the stairs ...

999
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,310
I asked her why there was trash on the stairs,

1000
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,798
She said she had gotten dizzy 
and dropped the trash bag.

1001
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,040
Is that not correct, Ma'am?

1002
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,715
- My kid took the trash.
- You said you had gotten dizzy.

1003
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,150
Ms. Kalani,
Didn't she wash the stairs that day?
They would have been wet.

1004
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,829
She might have slipped and fell on the ground.

1005
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,478
You asshole pushed her that
she slipped.

1006
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,476
Be respectful!

1007
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,471
I'm not saying anything in front of your familty.

1008
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,755
- You shouldn't be saying anything, you bastard!
- Sir, no cursing!

1009
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,512
Take him outside.

1010
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,517
This neighbors lives with them.
She won't say anything that's bad for him

1011
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,478
You can go file a complaint if you 
have a reason to think they are lying

1012
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,039
So do you're saying they are telling the truth?

1013
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,432
F@*k me that I've spent all my time here today.

1014
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,751
Excuse me. Could you give my kid's bag back?

1015
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,951
Here you go.

1016
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,955
Come on. Don't you want your coloring book?

1017
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,274
Honey, don't you be sad if I'm fighting with your parents.

1018
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,790
Here, let me put it into your bag.

1019
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,393
- My mom didn't take money.
- I know.

1020
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,029
And I wasn't fighting because of that, anyway.

1021
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,150
Then what was it for?

1022
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,759
I too get sad to see when she leaves my dad.

1023
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,074
Well, she had gone to a doctor.

1024
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,359
Go on, honey.

1025
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,674
Careful of the stairs.

1026
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,230
According to Court's request, I'll 
examined him and write whatever I see.

1027
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,551
Doctor, You can see that
he no longer speaks.

1028
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,111
Didn't you say he has Alzheimer's disease?

1029
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,556
Yes, but before this incident he spoke a little bit.

1030
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,114
This is a doctor's office. Not a court.
Go prove that there.

1031
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:33,919
- Does he have any bruises?
- Yes, a little bit.

1032
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,399
What happened?

1033
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,477
I'm not sure the bruises are from the fall from the bed.

1034
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,078
Don't run. Slow.

1035
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,230
Mom, open the window.
There's been a fight.

1036
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,474
This is a girls' school.
Can't you see?

1037
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,193
I just have a question from this lady.

1038
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,191
You can't sit here.

1039
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,952
If you want to fight, go get the police.

1040
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,393
I don't want to fight, Ma'am.
I just want to talk to her.

1041
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,870
I have nothing to say to you, Sir.
I don't know either you nor that women's husband.

1042
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,952
- Then why did you lie in court?
- What lies?

1043
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,634
- She knows which lie.
- Ms. Safaei, call the police.

1044
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,633
- Don't scare me from the police.
- You're fighting someone else, what does she have to do with it?

1045
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,598
Then why does she try to talk to my daughter?

1046
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,033
What did I have anything to do with your daughter?

1047
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,317
You're a teacher in this country.
Aren't you ashamed...?

1048
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,438
Why did you tell her 
'your dad hit your mom and killed the baby'?

1049
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,430
When did I ever say that?

1050
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,189
Aren't you ashamed to be basing all this
on a 4 year old child's drawings?

1051
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,231
Is that a reason?

1052
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,435
I didn't say such a thing, Sir.

1053
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,836
Why is that when you look at us, you think
we are beating our wives like animals all day?

1054
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,956
I swear on this Quran,
we're human beings like you, too.

1055
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,473
- Come on and go.
- Sir!

1056
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,070
Ma'am, I have nothing to lose in life.

1057
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,792
Tell your husband to not do something that'll
get both us in big trouble.
- Ok sir, go on.

1058
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,150
Ma'am, I'll be waiting outside...
- Good god Sir, go on.

1059
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,069
I am unemployed so I can wait there all day.
You'll eventually come out.

1060
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,920
Either you come to court and say you lied
or I'll look into what's going on between
you and her husband.

1061
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,117
Be shamefull.
What are you talking about? 
I've tried not to say anything so far ...

1062
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,113
- Then why are you protecting him?
- They call from the court, they asked a couple of questions
and I told the truth.

1063
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,553
- You told the truth?
- Yes!

1064
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,353
Here is a Qur'an. Put your hand and swear on it.

1065
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,800
Sir, why the swearing?
What does it have anything to do with her?

1066
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,711
It's ok, I'm not afraid.
What do I need to say?

1067
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,150
You said her husband didn't know my wife 
was pregnant. Is that right?

1068
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,389
- Yes.
- Then say that.

1069
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,875
I swear to this Qur'an, 
that the day I was in their house ...

1070
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,716
... her husband didn't hear our converation.
He was in the kitchen.

1071
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,954
Is that OK?
Or is there something else I need to say?

1072
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,748
He's crazy.

1073
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,753
Where are going now?
Call your husband.
Don't go alone.

1074
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,190
No, I don't want him to know about this.
- I'm so sorry Mrs. Qahraei.

1075
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,510
Why are you standing there?

1076
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,955
Hello?

1077
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,391
Hello, Mrs. Qahraei.
I left you a message before.

1078
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,913
Could you pick up the phone please?

1079
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,758
This woman that came for nursing to our house,

1080
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,917
Apperently got a gynecologists phone number from you.

1081
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,318
I was wondering if you could give me that number.

1082
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,439
So I could I call them to see if she did indeed go to see them.

1083
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,550
And if she did, what her issue was.
I'd appreciate if you could call me back.
Thank you.

1084
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,558
What do you want to do?

1085
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,871
What?

1086
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,195
You want this to continue?
Fighting everyday?

1087
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,674
Why? What happend?

1088
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,435
Today, he went to her school and started 
yelling in front of everyone...

1089
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,588
What'd he say?

1090
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,199
Shouted in front of everyone:
"His father killed my child".

1091
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,311
How will she be able to go back to that school anymore?

1092
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,192
Do you realize what you're doing?

1093
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,231
What am I doing?

1094
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,034
- He's threatning.
- The hell he is.

1095
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,717
Termeh, go to your room.

1096
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,269
What if tomorrow he killed your kid?

1097
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,472
What do you want me to do?
Take everything and go abroad?

1098
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,836
The hell with abroad.
Why aren't you talking normally?

1099
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,629
I'm talking to you about Termeh.
What sort of situation is this that 
you're creating for her?

1100
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,119
Did I create this situation?
I like how you can look me in
the eye and say this?

1101
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,877
Who left the house?
Who asked for a divorce?

1102
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,758
- You said you can go whenever you want.
- Yeah, I'll say it again. Why'd you come back?

1103
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,429
I didn't come back.
I came to figure out my child's situation.

1104
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,595
The situation is clear.

1105
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,433
- You have two options ...
- Don't you try to threaten me.

1106
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,999
What threat?

1107
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,751
Either you will resolved the situation with this guy ...

1108
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,149
- I'll know what to do with that.
- Didn't you hit her?

1109
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,515
Didn't you throw her into the staires?
Didn't her child die?

1110
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,556
Yeah!
I killed her child!

1111
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,632
Then why are you being so stubborn?
Pay the blood money, so it gets over with.

1112
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,790
- I won't be forced to pay.
- What do you mean forced?

1113
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,313
Just put yourself into these 
misfortunate people's place for one sec.

1114
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,119
- Am I responsible for their misfortunes?
- They're child is dead!

1115
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,956
My father was also injured.
Go look, he can't even utter one word now.

1116
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,998
How much did he talk before?

1117
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:25,118
Just those 4 words.
I was happy with just those 4 words.

1118
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,918
You're comparing this to you killing their child?

1119
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,036
- Where the hell were you to see I hit her?

1120
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:37,358
- Then how did her child die?
- I don't know. Just imagine for one sec
that maybe the husband hit her...

1121
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,995
And now they're trying to accuse me.

1122
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,879
You know what her child said the other day?
She said, they had gone to the doctor.

1123
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,958
What could have happened to her that
she couldn't wait 2 hours.

1124
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,875
Why did she have to lock this old man and leave?

1125
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,428
Inspection officer has said that the 
baby had died becuase of an impact.

1126
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,353
Lets say an impact.
Who's to say I was responsible for this impact?

1127
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,195
I will not accept it
until it's proven to me.

1128
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,520
Ok, then let me take Termeh.

1129
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,876
Shame on you.
Under these curcumstances, you've 
come here to put me under more pressure?

1130
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,268
I'm worried about her.

1131
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,119
Your child wants to stay here
and she has to be here to learn.

1132
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,310
Learn what? 
Stubbornness and confrontation?

1133
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,188
No, to learn not be a coward like you.
Or not to get scared as soon as someone threatened her.

1134
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,792
And he know who to come to threaten.
Why doesn't he come threaten me?

1135
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,360
Yes, I am a coward.

1136
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:28,435
You know what your problem is?
In your life, instead of staying and solving your issues ...

1137
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:34,476
... You've either ran away or you've surrendered.
- Is that so?

1138
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,710
Just tell me why you want to leave this country?

1139
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,119
You're afraid to stay.

1140
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:41,317
Excuse me, one week I was gone,
and see what you've done in this house.

1141
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,709
I couldn't?
Then I'm responsible.

1142
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,312
Let me take Termeh,
Then you can do whatever you want.

1143
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,596
Termeh, honey,
You don't have to stay here.

1144
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,951
Go wherever you're more comfortable.

1145
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,552
Don't you want to come, still?

1146
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,432
They sell it for 2000 rial per killo.

1147
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,388
If they use 270 killo every day,
Write 270.

1148
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,510
Ok, then how much is his revenue?
Meaning how much will his profit be.

1149
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,799
So, how would you solve this?

1150
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,158
Did you lie?

1151
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,908
What?

1152
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,832
Did you lie?

1153
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,279
About what?

1154
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,918
That you didn't know she was pregnant.

1155
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,714
Why?

1156
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:50,597
You said you couldn't hear what Ms. Qahraei
and Razieh were talking about.

1157
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,469
Yeah.

1158
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:56,958
Then how'd you know Ms. Qahraei gave
her the doctor's phone number?

1159
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,311
She didn't say anyhting then.

1160
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,198
Very well.

1161
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,113
If you want to calculate the profit ...

1162
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,876
Yeah, I knew.

1163
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,151
Your mother was telling the truth.

1164
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:32,117
I could hear everything from the kitchen.

1165
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,591
So why did you say that didn't know?

1166
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,269
Do you know what would have happned if I had said so?

1167
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,638
They would have taken me to prison form 1 to 3 years.

1168
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,677
I just thought at that moment what 
would happen to you in that situation. 

1169
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,149
... With whom would you stay with.

1170
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,151
So I said I didn't know.

1171
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,756
If you knew, then why did you hit her?

1172
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,390
Look, I knew she was pregnant,
but I didn't know at that moment.

1173
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,832
I had forgotten.
I wasn't paying attention.

1174
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,515
Then why don't you just tell them this stuff?

1175
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:21,720
Dear, the law doesn't care about this stuff.

1176
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,957
They say you either knew or you didn't.

1177
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,599
Look at me.

1178
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,835
If you tell me to go tell them right now,
I will.

1179
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,838
- Hello.
- Hello dear.

1180
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,756
Didn't I tell you not to come in front of the school?

1181
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,394
Ms. Qahraei!

1182
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,719
What do you want from her?

1183
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,748
Ms. Qahraei, wait one min ...

1184
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,630
If you just stop one second,
I want to explain something to you. That's all.

1185
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,110
Please let me ...
Why...

1186
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,674
Dad!

1187
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,636
Who's responsible for my child's safty right now?

1188
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,398
I can't do anything without a witness.

1189
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:33,155
Now, what am I suppose to do if I don't have a witness?
Should wait till he kills my child, then come to you?

1190
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,034
- How can I know you're tellig the truth?
- Why would I lie?

1191
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:41,551
Would I bring my father and child here to lie to you?

1192
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,756
- Is your daughter here right now?
- Yes, she's outside.

1193
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,791
You can ask yourself.

1194
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,589
I'm afraid to take her to school.
I'm afraid to leave my father at home.

1195
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,633
- Is the plaintiff here?
- I can't leave my dad at home alone...
- Are you done writing?

1196
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,115
Almost done Sir.
- Quick.

1197
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,910
So you didn't know that this man's wife is pregnant, right?

1198
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,195
No, I didn't know.

1199
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:05,716
You didn't hear them when she was talking
about it to you're kids teacher?
- No I didn't

1200
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,433
You didn't hear, huh?

1201
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,273
I'm saying if anybody wants to go arround threaten ...

1202
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,311
Then why did the teacher come and withdrew her statement?

1203
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,348
Saying you knew.

1204
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,553
- She came here saying I knew?
- Yes, she came yesterday.

1205
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,312
Well, he's gone to the school and threatened her...

1206
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,040
Answer me:
Did you hear her or not?

1207
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,309
I said no.

1208
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,317
Then where did you know she had given her the phone number?

1209
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,595
- My daughter told me.
- What did she say?

1210
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,837
Just that she had gotten the number from her teacher.

1211
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,837
Tell her to come inside.

1212
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,473
Right now?
- Yes.

1213
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,799
And you wait outside.

1214
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,114
What question?

1215
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,118
What is he goning to ask?

1216
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,997
I don't know.
Give that to me.

1217
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,832
So, what do you have to say?

1218
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,992
You haven't asked anythig yet.

1219
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,949
Didn't your father tell you what I'm going to ask you?

1220
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,750
- No.
- Which grade are you in?

1221
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,034
Sixth.

1222
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:14,759
And the day that lady came to talk about 
the phone number and the pregnancy...

1223
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,435
... You were there?

1224
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,476
I wasn't there at that moment.
I had gone to get my books.

1225
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,595
Then how'd you know that your teacher 
had given her the doctor's phone number?

1226
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,595
Cause she gave her the number later.
When she was leaving...

1227
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,639
- In front of you?
- Yes.

1228
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,518
Then why didn't you tell this to your dad earlier?

1229
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,715
What?

1230
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,837
That the lady had gotten the doctor's
number from your teacher.

1231
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,790
I didn't think it would be important to my father.

1232
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,352
So then, did you tell your dad or did he hear himself?

1233
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,713
That she had gotten the number?
I told him.

1234
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,271
- You told him?
- Yes.

1235
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,039
OK.
You can go.

1236
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:50,196
- What crime have I commited?
- Nothing. You're right.

1237
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,760
Well, you're husband dosn't accept responsibility.

1238
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,860
I can accepted that he's responsible,
but in the end, what's suppose to happen?

1239
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:58,440
Go to court for one or two years,
to maybe get the blood money in payments of, what,

1240
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,431
Lets say 100,000 per month
- Why do you...

1241
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:04,479
Why do you think it's about the money
that I'm going to court?

1242
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,273
When did I say such a thing?

1243
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,476
You think I'm a bum,
I have nothing to do...
- No!

1244
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,632
And we don't understand anything?

1245
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,030
- I never said such a thing.
- Let's listen to what she has to say.

1246
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,315
There is no other way.
Neither will your child come back,

1247
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,239
Nor will they hang my husband.

1248
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,478
And her husband didn't do it intentionally.

1249
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:26,393
They're good people, I swear.
They're offering you a good solution.

1250
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,911
Take the money and end it all. 
You're unemployed, take it and
use it for something you need.

1251
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,950
Right now we can determine an amount,
I'll get my husband to agree.

1252
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,231
Now, he has to agree.
For God's sake, leave us alone.

1253
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,474
Are you saying this based on anger?

1254
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,518
- Look at yourself for a sec.
- Don't let him go, Ali agha.

1255
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,394
Wait a minute.
I wanna to talk to you.

1256
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

1257
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,353
Are you staying?

1258
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,392
Mom ...

1259
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,437
Let us have our talk.

1260
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,590
Come, sit down.
I want to talk to you.

1261
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,519
I can hear you.

1262
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,437
Today I went to talk with her husband.

1263
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,474
Sit down for one min.

1264
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:30,912
I talked to him. After a whole lot of trouble,
I got him to agree to take 15 million instead of 40 million...

1265
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,673
With three 5 million checks.

1266
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,195
Who let you promise him money?

1267
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,876
- I can't keep being under stress about my child's safety.
- No, you didn't understand me.

1268
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,555
Even now that you had gotten late, I was dying.

1269
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,240
I'm saying, why are you getting involved in this?

1270
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,036
I havn't come here to fight.

1271
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,470
God, what do I have to do 
so she can understand me?

1272
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,632
Didn't you say you were responsible?
Didn't you say I introduced her?

1273
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,911
... Didn't you say if I hadn't gone, 
none of this would have happened?

1274
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,399
But I tell him I'm willing to pay, that'd
mean I've accpeted I'm responsible.

1275
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:02,155
If you pay now, it means that I'm accepting responsibilty.

1276
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,840
- But he'll drop the case...
- You think he'll leave us alone?

1277
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,798
- You think he'll leave us if you don't pay?
- Why would I pay blackmail?

1278
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,199
Think of it as my dowry.

1279
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:15,040
I will get that money if I have to find it under a ...
If I have to, I'll go beg, borrow to get that for you.

1280
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,998
But I neither have nor will I pay unjust money.

1281
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:21,197
You're child going through puberty.
She'd being tortured in this situation.

1282
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:26,873
So you understand the sensitivity
of the age of puberty?

1283
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,799
She wouldn't have stayed if she was being tortured.

1284
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,436
Why do you think she's staying with you?

1285
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,752
You think she's chosen you?

1286
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:38,190
She's staying with you so we don't get seperated.

1287
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,395
She knows I won't go anywhere without her.

1288
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:46,959
She's being tortured, but she doesn't show it.

1289
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,555
Call them right now, tell them my husband won't agree ...


1290
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,194
... until it's proven to him that he's responsible.

1291
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,319
I'll sell my car.

1292
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,477
- I don't want you to sell your car for me.
- It's not for you.

1293
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,995
When your child is not imporatnt enought to you
to pay 15 million...

1294
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,833
What the hell are you talking about?
Who says it's about the money?

1295
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,236
I can't sit around til my child's safety is guaranteed.

1296
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:15,269
Look at me, You have no right to do anything else.
Do you understand?

1297
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:18,433
Had I done nothing,
You'd be in jail.

1298
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,040
Go get your mom's house title back.

1299
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,793
I don't want to be out with the bail you got me.

1300
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,398
Get up, Termeh.
Get up, lets go.

1301
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,112
Get up, I tell you.

1302
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,992
Mother, please.

1303
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,993
- I don't want you to stay here for one more second.
- No, mom, I won't let you.

1304
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,879
If 15 million is more important to you than your child...

1305
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,678
I won't let you do this.

1306
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,349
If his child is not important enough ...

1307
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,516
Mother, please listen,
why are you doing this?

1308
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:08,954
You said you would stay.

1309
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:12,510
- The HELL I did! The HELL I did!
- Mom, please!

1310
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,273
- Mom, please!
- I'll be waiting in the car.

1311
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:29,155
It's ok dear, go there til the end of exams.

1312
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,036
Grandma and grandpa will be there, too.

1313
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,352
You'll be more comfortable.

1314
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,198
Didn't you say this isn't serious?

1315
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,433
It got serious.

1316
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,313
Termeh ...

1317
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,592
Honey ...

1318
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,954
I'll cry too if you cry.

1319
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,918
Why don't you go pay these people so mom would come back?

1320
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,309
Whether your mom comes back has nothing to do with it.

1321
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,311
Yes, it does.
She had come to stay.

1322
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,914
Her stuff was in the back of the car, I saw myself.

1323
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,476
If you think I'm responsible,
Go tell your mom to come back.

1324
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,756
We'll call and setup a time with these people to go pay them.

1325
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,159
I have doubts.

1326
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,878
Didn't he throw you?

1327
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,595
Yes.

1328
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,117
Did something happen at home?

1329
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,075
No. Even before it,
my child didn't move.

1330
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,833
Before he threw you?

1331
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,629
So the child had already died?

1332
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,273
- I do not know. Maybe.
- What happened before?

1333
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:29,275
I'm not sure, but I had
pains the previous night.

1334
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,075
- Have you had a miscarriage before?
- No.

1335
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,837
I was hit by a car.

1336
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,917
His dad had left to go outside.
So I went after him.

1337
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:52,950
He was crossing the steert.

1338
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,032
I ran to get him so he wouldn't get hit by a car,
but a car hit me.

1339
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,393
The pain began that night.

1340
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,316
Does your husband know about this?

1341
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,749
Why don't you go talk about this in the court?

1342
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,154
My husband would kill himself if he 
found out I came here and said these things.

1343
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:19,788
He's been waiting since yesterday,
when he told about it to the lenders.

1344
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,870
What does my husband have to do with this?
Go look what's happend to our life.

1345
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,593
It's my own fault.

1346
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,158
Whe you called him yesterday about the money...

1347
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,432
... I got really scared.
I called a few people.

1348
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,637
They said if you have doubts,
It'd be a great sin to take the money.

1349
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,557
It has to be proven that my husband is innocent,
so we wouldn't have to pay the money. 

1350
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,677
No please.
I beg you not to take these words outside here.

1351
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:52,350
But your husband's not letting go.

1352
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,998
I fear for my child.

1353
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:57,954
I fear too if I take the money;
Something might happen to my kid

1354
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,318
So now what can I do?

1355
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,272
Don't pay this money.

1356
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,949
Don't.

1357
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,951
Will your husband let it go?

1358
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,753
Give that to me.
Go bring some plates.

1359
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,996
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

1360
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:19,031
Whenever you withdrew your complaint,
We'll give you these three checks right there.

1361
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,839
God bless.

1362
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,993
Hojjat, go bring a pen and paper, 
Write all these down.

1363
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,076
I just wanted to say something before...

1364
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:31,869
- Lets just end it.
- I accepted, but...
- There's no need for...

1365
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:38,308
Sure, I just wanted to say something in the
presence of my daughter and his wife.

1366
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,353
Why isn't she coming?

1367
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,434
Thank you, Ma'am.

1368
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,710
Could you call my daughter too, please.

1369
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:54,157
Little girl,
your father needs you.

1370
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,196
Termeh, come sit here.

1371
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,956
Excuse me.
- No problem.

1372
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,355
Look ...

1373
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,836
I wrote the checks and I'll give them to you.
No problem.

1374
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,469
Done.

1375
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,792
I had a favor to ask, though.

1376
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,676
Ma'am, you're a religious woman.

1377
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,596
Please swear on a Quran that I was
the casue of your miscarriage.

1378
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,511
Please bring a Quran.

1379
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,474
Go bring it yourself.

1380
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,355
Come back soon, or they'll get suspicious.

1381
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:11,351
Lenders are here for the money.
Don't make us look bad, I beg you.

1382
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,831
I won't swear.

1383
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,757
Didn't you say the car hit you
when you went after his father?

1384
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:26,352
- Why aren't you coming?
- She's afraid to swear.

1385
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,639
- What do you mean?
- I... I have doubts.

1386
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,517
Oh God ...

1387
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,712
Azam, you go be with them.

1388
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:49,675
Why are you saying this now?

1389
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,516
I swear I told Azam.

1390
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,749
Tell me exactly what happened.

1391
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,272
The day before it, a car hit me.

1392
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,074
And I had a lot of pain that night.

1393
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,069
- Let's go, I'll take responsibility for the sin.
- No.

1394
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,072
It's a sin. I asked.

1395
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,232
What sin? He himself agreed to give.
Let's go.

1396
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,118
I'm scared.
I swear to god, we'll become hapless.

1397
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:28,476
More hapless than this?
Look at my situation for one second.

1398
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:32,354
Have mercy on me.
Have mercy to your child.

1399
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:35,079
I'm afraid something would happen to our child.
Why are you doing this?

1400
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,192
- Let's go.
- I can not.

1401
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,835
- Let's go.
- I can not.

1402
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:45,231
I swear I can't.
- Come on, I'm hapless, let's go.

1403
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,273
Lady, why'd come you here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1404
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,510
Didn't I say we don't want this money?

1405
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,195
How can I live in this house anymore?

1406
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,710
Why did you do this to my life?

1407
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,835
Come on, honey.

1408
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,358
Honey, Let's go.

1409
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,960
- Hello.
- Hello. Come on in.

1410
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,551
So, what's the decision?

1411
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:27,070
Your parents have left the decision to 
you now that they are seperating.
Which do you prefer to live with?

1412
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,037
Your dad or your mom?

1413
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,036
- Have you made your decision yet?
- Yes.

1414
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,472
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1415
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,599
- Have you made your decision, or not?
- Yes.

1416
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,798
So what's it going to be, my dear?

1417
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,391
Do I have to say it now?

1418
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,875
- If you havn't thought about it ...
- Yes, I have.

1419
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,671
- If you havn't thought about it yet...
- Yes, I've made my mind.

1420
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,869
So?

1421
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,272
If it's too hard for you,
do you want them to go outside?

1422
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,913
Can they?

1423
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,318
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1424
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,869
You too please, Ma'am.

1425
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:40,869
