1
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,376
Hold positions!

2
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:54,972
Fire the arrows!

3
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:54,590
Tinúviel the elven-fair

4
01:07:55,747 --> 01:08:02,790
Immortal maiden elven-wise

5
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:10,090
About him cast her night-dark hair

6
01:08:11,638 --> 01:08:15,520
And arms like silver glimmering.

7
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:18,090
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

8
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:23,490
Hear my voice...come back to the light.

9
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:57,767
Stay with the Hobbits,
I'll send horses for you.

10
01:19:57,769 --> 01:20:00,246
I'm the faster rider, I'll take him.

11
01:20:00,248 --> 01:20:01,737
The Road is too dangerous.

12
01:20:03,134 --> 01:20:05,675
Frodo is dying.
If I can get across the river...

13
01:20:05,677 --> 01:20:08,890
...the power of my people
will protect him.

14
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:15,723
As you wish.

15
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,390
Ride fast Asfaloth!

16
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,529
Waters of the Misty Mountains,
listen to the great word.

17
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:53,641
Flow waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths

18
01:22:53,643 --> 01:22:56,793
Waters of the Misty Mountains,
listen to the great word.

19
01:22:56,795 --> 01:23:00,171
Flow waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths

20
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:09,590
Hear my voice...
come back to the light.

21
01:35:46,201 --> 01:35:48,919
The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn

22
01:35:49,903 --> 01:35:53,490
Not over you, not over me.

23
01:36:04,657 --> 01:36:07,898
Do you remember when we first met?

24
01:36:11,384 --> 01:36:15,418
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

25
01:36:16,315 --> 01:36:18,990
Long years have passed.

26
01:36:20,037 --> 01:36:23,690
You did not wear the
troubles you carry now.

27
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,839
Do you remember what I told you?

28
01:38:59,006 --> 01:39:03,072
"One ring to rule them all...

29
01:39:03,074 --> 01:39:06,788
...One ring to find them...

30
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:11,169
...One ring to bring them all...

31
01:39:11,171 --> 01:39:17,290
...and in the darkness bind them."

32
01:40:44,526 --> 01:40:46,429
Sit down, Legolas.

33
01:41:57,462 --> 01:41:59,901
One ring to rule them all...

34
01:43:14,092 --> 01:43:16,874
One ring to rule them all...

35
01:43:16,876 --> 01:43:19,388
...One ring to find them...

36
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:21,488
One ring to rule them all...

37
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,593
...One ring to find them...

38
01:43:23,595 --> 01:43:25,588
One ring to rule them all...

39
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:27,794
...One ring to find them...

40
01:43:27,796 --> 01:43:29,690
One ring to rule them all...

41
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:15,675
She wanted to protect her child.

42
01:46:17,272 --> 01:46:20,672
She thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

43
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:11,421
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

44
01:55:13,966 --> 01:55:16,060
May your horn be bloodstained!

45
01:55:35,325 --> 01:55:41,558
Sleep Caradhras, be still,
lie still, hold your wrath!

46
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:47,194
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

47
01:55:47,196 --> 01:55:50,858
May your bloodstained horn...

48
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:54,760
...fall upon enemy heads!

49
01:59:47,983 --> 01:59:52,792
Gate of the elves, open now for me!

50
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:07,860
...listen to the word of my tongue.

51
02:00:43,043 --> 02:00:45,043
Gate of elves...

52
02:00:46,547 --> 02:00:49,047
...listen to my word..

53
02:00:49,543 --> 02:00:51,743
...threshold of dwarves...

54
02:00:58,722 --> 02:00:59,922
Doorway of the dwarf-folk...

55
02:31:13,554 --> 02:31:16,392
Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.

56
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:19,972
Our fellowship stands in your debt,
Haldir of Lórien.

57
02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:24,446
Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...

58
02:31:24,796 --> 02:31:26,496
...you are known to us.

59
02:31:39,403 --> 02:31:44,003
I spit upon your grave!

60
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:14,558
We need your protection.
The road is fell!

61
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:18,026
I wish we may come with you. 
Please, understand, we need your support!

62
02:32:33,025 --> 02:32:40,340
I wish we may come with you.
The road is very dangerous.

63
02:48:54,788 --> 02:48:56,860
You are being tracked.

64
02:50:49,319 --> 02:50:50,660
For her love...

65
02:50:51,543 --> 02:50:56,943
...I fear the grace of
Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

66
02:50:57,830 --> 02:51:02,330
I would have her leave these shores...

67
02:51:02,806 --> 02:51:06,006
...and be with her people.

68
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:13,080
I would have her take
the ship to Valinor.

69
02:51:38,253 --> 02:51:39,018
Farewell.

70
02:51:43,619 --> 02:51:47,419
There is much you have yet to do.

71
02:51:49,071 --> 02:51:57,401
We shall not meet again, Elessar.

72
03:02:36,947 --> 03:02:40,447
They will fall.
