HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

3
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,562
Miss Sophie

4
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:17,106
I've closed up the shop

5
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:19,692
You should come too, Sophie

6
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:22,778
I'll just finish this
Go have some fun

7
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,905
All right, then, I'm off

8
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,199
I'm going

9
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,327
Look, it's Howl's castle

10
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,912
What? Howl? Where, where?

11
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,956
Look how close it is

12
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, no

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,085
I wonder if Howl's in town

14
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,344
It took off

15
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,097
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers

16
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,808
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

17
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,311
They say Howl tore her heart out

18
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,312
How scary...

19
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:58,814
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours

20
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:01,942
Hurry up

21
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,237
Really?

22
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,907
Oh, cut it out...

23
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:10,946
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

24
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,115
Oh, no... I'm fine

25
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:15,659
Then how about a cup of tea?

26
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,036
Care to join me?

27
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,829
No thank you, I'm busy

28
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,582
She sure is a cute little mouse

29
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,917
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

30
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:25,753
Let me pass!

31
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:29,298
See, it's those whiskers of yours

32
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,383
She's even cuter when she's mad

33
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,260
Hey, there, I'm sorry

34
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:35,637
Where've you been?

35
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,097
Who are you?

36
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm with her

37
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,602
Why don't you two take
a little walk

38
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:47,316
What the... '?
Hey, wha...

39
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,569
Don't hold it against them

40
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,905
They're harmless

41
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:56,241
Where to? I'll be your escort

42
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,827
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari's

43
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:01,538
Act normal
I'm being followed

44
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,831
Just walk

45
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,979
Sorry, I got you involved

46
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,943
This way

47
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:39,493
Hold on

48
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:48,001
Drop your legs, keep walking

49
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,717
That's right, don't be frightened

50
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:12,693
Very nice

51
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,543
I'll draw them off

52
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,378
Wait here until the coast is clear

53
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,921
Yes

54
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:35,090
That's my girl

55
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,188
Any chocolate Letties?

56
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:50,814
Look this way, Lettie

57
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,941
- Hey, make room
- Let's go for a walk, Lettie

58
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,026
My sister?

59
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,446
Come back soon, Lettie

60
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,367
Sophie?

61
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,913
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

62
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:07,414
Have you become an angel?

63
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,626
It feels like I'm in a dream...

64
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,961
Lettie, why not use the office?

65
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:16,423
Thanks, but I should really
be working

66
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:21,178
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

67
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:23,263
He was so kind...

68
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:26,266
He rescued me...

69
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,102
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart

70
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,815
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up

71
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,819
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties

72
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,738
There you go again

73
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:43,116
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times

74
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:46,036
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl

75
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,622
Sophie?

76
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:51,625
Oh, you...

77
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,588
Lettie, the Madeleines are done

78
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,966
Okay, be right there

79
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,259
All right

80
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,637
I'm going home

81
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,973
It's a relief to know
you're doing well

82
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,101
Hello, Lettie

83
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,310
Nice to see you

84
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:14,314
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

85
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,444
It meant so much to Papa
Besides, I'm the eldest

86
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:23,532
That's not what I meant
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

87
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:25,117
Well, I...

88
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,451
Bye, Lettie

89
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,911
Come by the shop next time

90
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:28,912
Sure

91
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,163
I'll be on my way

92
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:34,001
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself

93
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:44,321
Sorry, the shop's closed

94
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:46,907
I thought I'd looked the door

95
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:53,914
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats

96
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:58,085
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself

97
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:02,005
This is just a simple hat shop

98
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,263
I think you had better leave

99
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:14,768
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste

100
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:16,937
The Witch of the Waste?

101
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:27,948
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell

102
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:30,367
My regards to Howl

103
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,582
Is this really me!

104
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:21,168
I've got to stay calm

105
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,519
I've got to calm down

106
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,397
It's no use panicking, Sophie

107
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,568
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

108
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:52,532
I've got to calm down

109
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,378
I'm back!

110
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,963
Welcome home, Ma'am!

111
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,673
- Welcome home
- How do you like it?

112
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,634
It's all the rage in Kingsbury

113
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,843
Amazing

114
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:12,886
It suits you

115
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:15,305
Don't you think it's wonderful?

116
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:16,223
Sophie!

117
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:21,061
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

118
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,063
I wonder what's the matter?

119
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:27,067
Sophie!

120
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,659
Don't come in

121
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,078
I've got an awful cold

122
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,913
I don't want you to catch it

123
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,666
You sound just awful...

124
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,793
Like some 90 year-old woman

125
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:47,629
I'll stay in bed today

126
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,423
You sure? All right, then

127
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:54,678
Here we go...

128
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:07,607
You'll be fine, old lady

129
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:11,945
You're still healthy, and these clothes
finally suit you

130
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:16,783
But I can't stay here

131
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,628
Ouch, ouch

132
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:31,673
It's not easy being old

133
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:44,394
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

134
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,325
Like a hand, granny?

135
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:02,370
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage

136
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:06,082
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

137
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,835
Just a bit farther than where
you're going

138
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,592
I don't recommend it, granny

139
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:18,345
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead

140
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:20,263
Thank you

141
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,350
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

142
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,852
Says her youngest sister's there

143
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,869
I've hardly made any progress at all

144
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:48,041
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth

145
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:57,634
That'll make a good cane

146
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,552
Up we go

147
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,144
Might be a bit too thick

148
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,321
Ouch, ouch

149
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,699
What a stubborn branch

150
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,537
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie

151
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:27,372
Heave

152
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,429
A Scarecrow, eh? I thought you were
working for the Witch

153
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,724
But how do you stand by yourself?

154
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,353
Your head's a turnip

155
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:54,190
I've always hated turnips

156
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,943
At least you're not
upside down anymore

157
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,611
So long

158
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:07,620
It's so cold

159
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,415
The town's still so close

160
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,508
Don't follow me
You don't owe me a thing

161
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,969
You must be a magical whatever-you-are

162
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:25,847
I've had enough of witches and spells!

163
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:29,267
Just go stand wherever you like!

164
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:53,792
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

165
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:58,171
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

166
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:12,018
Seems you get more cunning with age

167
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:24,739
What a huge battleship

168
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:31,579
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old

169
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:52,308
I smell smoke
Maybe there's a cabin

170
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,706
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

171
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,877
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

172
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,306
What is this?

173
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,891
You call this a castle?

174
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:55,163
Is that the way in?

175
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,000
Just wait up there

176
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,837
Hey, there!

177
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,883
Are you going to let me on, or not!

178
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,222
My shawl!

179
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:30,031
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip
I'm going in

180
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,324
Thank you

181
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:35,328
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine

182
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,958
This time, it's really goodbye

183
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,919
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

184
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,963
May you find happiness

185
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:36,431
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap

186
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:49,736
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

187
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:01,539
That's some spell you're under

188
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,501
It won't be easy to break

189
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:08,629
The fire talked

190
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,132
And you can't even
tell anyone about it

191
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,217
You're Howl?

192
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:17,805
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

193
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:22,602
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

194
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:24,312
Easy

195
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,939
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

196
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,609
I'll break your spell in a flash

197
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:33,279
In other words, bargain with a demon

198
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,656
You sure you can keep that promise?

199
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,326
Demons don't make promises

200
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:41,621
I suggest you look elsewhere

201
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,831
But I'm an exploited demon

202
00:22:43,831 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death

203
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,588
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving

204
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:54,300
My, you've got it rough

205
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:58,930
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break

206
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,808
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too

207
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:06,354
All right
A bargain, eh?

208
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,652
Granny

209
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,529
Granny

210
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,327
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her

211
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,175
Hey, who's this?

212
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:19,051
Porthaven!

213
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,220
When did she get in?

214
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,353
Stand by

215
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,735
Why, Mayor, sir

216
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:39,739
The sun is already high
Is Master Jenkins at home?

217
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,074
The Master is out

218
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,744
I answer in his stead

219
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,206
An invitation from His Majesty

220
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:49,582
It has come to war

221
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:52,543
His Majesty desires every wizard

222
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:55,546
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland

223
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,925
His presence is imperative
That is all

224
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:03,262
War, how awful

225
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:06,098
And who might you be?

226
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,517
Calcifer let me in

227
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:11,896
Don't look at me
She wandered in from the Wastes

228
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:13,439
The Wastes?

229
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,776
That's strange
You're not a witch, are you?

230
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:19,654
A witch could never get in

231
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:22,114
Porthaven, again

232
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,367
A customer?

233
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,662
Stand by

234
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:32,375
State your purpose

235
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,126
Mama sent me

236
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:37,296
The usual spell?

237
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,758
Behave yourself, now

238
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,193
It's not the Wastes

239
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:02,113
Granny, are you a witch, too?

240
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:06,951
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land

241
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:10,079
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it

242
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,247
Sure

243
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,167
Many thanks

244
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,588
I can't have you making up things

245
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:21,590
You should give up that disguise

246
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,510
It's not a disguise, it's magic

247
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:28,139
The Kingsbury door

248
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:30,808
Stand by

249
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,150
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

250
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,359
It is, indeed

251
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,696
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty

252
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:48,200
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace

253
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:51,037
Our thanks to you

254
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:08,387
A city fit for a king

255
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:11,140
Get back in or you'll lose your nose

256
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:18,564
Stop wandering around

257
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:57,686
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad

258
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,648
This is a magic house, isn't it?

259
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:01,774
Oh, boy!

260
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:04,068
Where does the black one lead?

261
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:05,444
Only Master Howl knows

262
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:08,447
I'm having my breakfast

263
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:20,126
But you've got bacon and eggs

264
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,171
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away

265
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:29,635
I'll cook for you

266
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,178
But you can't

267
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,265
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl

268
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,476
That's right, I won't cook for you

269
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,770
Oh, here's my hat

270
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:46,485
All right, Calcifer
Be a good fire, now

271
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:49,155
Forget it, I'm a demon

272
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,824
I answer to no one

273
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:55,494
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you

274
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:58,497
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

275
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:03,836
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in

276
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,838
So, what'll it be?

277
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,303
That's right, there's a good fire

278
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:17,183
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon

279
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:19,852
Calcifer's doing what she says

280
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:22,688
I'd like some tea, too
Have you got a kettle?

281
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:23,856
Sure

282
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,242
Welcome home, Master Howl

283
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,453
You have letters from the king

284
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:39,872
To Jenkins and to Pendragon

285
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:53,886
Calcifer, you're so obedient

286
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,888
She bullied me

287
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:59,141
Not an easy thing to do

288
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,101
Who exactly are you?

289
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,313
I'm Grandma Sophie

290
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:07,107
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady

291
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:08,776
Give me that

292
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,908
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs

293
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,429
Yummy

294
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,765
Yummy

295
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:48,899
And who hired you to clean?

296
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,277
Why, I hired myself

297
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:53,779
I've never seen such a filthy house

298
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,656
Hmm

299
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,533
Markl, plates

300
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:03,497
You're all ganging up on me

301
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,374
Please join us, Sophie

302
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:12,506
Sit over here

303
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:28,314
Pick one

304
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,816
Everything else is dirty

305
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:35,821
I've got my work cut out for me

306
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:39,158
Markl

307
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,159
Yes

308
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:43,037
Sophie

309
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,496
Thank you

310
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:48,584
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread

311
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:49,710
Our daily bread

312
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,212
Haven't had a real breakfast
in along while

313
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,889
So many manners to teach...

314
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:05,726
So, what's that in your pocket?

315
00:32:07,603 --> 00:32:09,021
What?

316
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,364
I wonder what it is

317
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:20,032
Let me

318
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:28,874
It's scorched into the table
Master Howl, this is...

319
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,502
Ancient sorcery

320
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:32,878
And powerful, too

321
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,713
The Witch of the Waste?

322
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:39,593
“He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless men

323
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:42,012
“Your heart shall be mine..."

324
00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:43,514
Well, so much for the table

325
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,238
Wow, it's gone!

326
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,740
The Scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell

327
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,952
Brethren, continue your meal

328
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,248
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers

329
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:16,880
And send hot water to the bath

330
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,048
Not that, too!

331
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,928
Do you work for the
Witch of the Waste?

332
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:28,267
Don't be stupid! The witch...

333
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:35,691
Actually...
the witch... I...

334
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,777
Confound it!

335
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:42,906
Damn that Witch of the Waste
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

336
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,950
Let me finish eating this

337
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:52,624
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out

338
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:57,171
Every last one of you, mocking me

339
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:06,221
There's a spell I need

340
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:07,473
Later

341
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,641
A witch rages within

342
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,649
Sophie

343
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:22,821
Sophie, I'm going out

344
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,908
I'll die without some fresh wood

345
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,368
What, what are you doing?

346
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,039
I'll fall, I'll fall
I'm in peril

347
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:34,374
I'm sweeping the ashes

348
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:35,501
Won't be a minute

349
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,544
Oh, no
Oh, no

350
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:39,338
I'm in danger

351
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,799
I'm in danger...

352
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,383
I'll go out

353
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:49,473
Oh, no
I'm slipping...

354
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,689
Hurry, Sophie

355
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:22,881
Try not to torment my friend

356
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:30,430
Master Howl, are you going out?

357
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:37,396
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away

358
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,069
What'd you do, Sophie?

359
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:46,572
She abused me

360
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:49,992
If I die, Howl goes with me

361
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:51,577
I'm the cleaning lady

362
00:35:51,577 --> 00:35:53,871
It's my job to clean

363
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:57,916
No, not the 2nd floor!

364
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,420
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry

365
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:04,423
Save my room for later

366
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,762
My little outburst gave me back
my strength

367
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:16,643
What a strange house

368
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:54,890
Amazing!

369
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,142
Calcifer, Calcifer!

370
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,436
Are you moving the castle?

371
00:36:59,436 --> 00:37:02,147
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am

372
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,649
You're incredible, Calcifer

373
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:07,194
Your magic's first class
I misjudged you completely

374
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,114
You think so?

375
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:13,533
You really think so!

376
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,959
Oh, no, not yet!

377
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:55,826
How beautiful

378
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,953
It's called Star Lake

379
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,002
Something's stuck in there

380
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:07,504
Oh, dear
Lend me a hand, Markl

381
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:08,630
Sure

382
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,054
And up!

383
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:17,723
A Scarecrow

384
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:19,683
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head

385
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:22,728
You sure like being upside down

386
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:34,156
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me

387
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:36,199
He followed me here

388
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,493
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

389
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:42,247
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land

390
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:14,321
Turnip, don't pull it so tight

391
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:25,624
Seems like he likes doing the wash

392
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,418
They'll dry in no time

393
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:33,298
Turnip must belong to the demons

394
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:35,133
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him

395
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,136
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead

396
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,891
But he led me
to this wonderful place

397
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:28,186
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie

398
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:31,648
Why, thank you
We'd better be getting back

399
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:33,775
How mysterious

400
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:37,320
I've never felt such peace

401
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:56,983
Stinks

402
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,070
You reek of burnt flesh and steel

403
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:22,801
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back

404
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:29,933
Isn't it great! Sophie did this for me

405
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:34,604
The fighting is fierce

406
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:38,692
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border

407
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,027
I hate the fire in gunpowder

408
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:44,322
They have no manners

409
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,950
My own kind attacked me

410
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,493
The Witch of the Waste?

411
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:52,038
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters

412
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:55,417
They'll cry plenty later on,

413
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,877
when they can't regain human form

414
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:01,339
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry

415
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:04,342
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

416
00:43:04,342 --> 00:43:05,760
Yes, well...

417
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,387
Hot water for my bath

418
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:09,389
Oh, no, not again

419
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:43,673
Is that Howl?

420
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:46,051
Yeah, wasting my hot water again

421
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:54,309
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast

422
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:55,518
No matter'

423
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:57,103
Morning

424
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:02,233
It's lovely shopping in the morning

425
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:04,194
I've never seen the ocean

426
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:06,988
Such beautiful, sparkling water

427
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,032
Same as it always is

428
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:20,251
I myself hate potatoes

429
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:21,419
Pay up

430
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:22,962
Thank you

431
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:24,214
Thanks

432
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:28,593
Fish, all fresh off the boat

433
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:30,011
That one's tasty

434
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:32,055
I myself hate fish

435
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,891
The fleet's come home

436
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,975
Is that the smoke?

437
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:37,602
There's been another battle

438
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:39,938
Really? Sorry, lady, later

439
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,523
That ship's on fire!

440
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,006
Sophie, let's go get a closer look

441
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:10,218
No, I've no stomach for such things
Let's go home

442
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:13,638
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this

443
00:45:18,268 --> 00:45:20,687
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby

444
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,355
Don't move

445
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:24,607
They work for the Witch of the Waste

446
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:31,739
They're gone

447
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:34,117
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

448
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:41,708
Look! Up there!

449
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,793
That's what dropped those bombs!

450
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:45,795
An enemy airship, Sophie

451
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,553
Sophie, flyers

452
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,890
Ignore the flyers
They're enemy propaganda!

453
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:03,146
Are you OK, Sophie?

454
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,488
A glass of water, please

455
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:12,614
Sure

456
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:31,257
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

457
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:34,385
My hair's turned this weird color!

458
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:36,346
What... what beautiful hair

459
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:37,514
Take a good look!

460
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:41,100
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells

461
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:44,896
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up

462
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:46,898
Cleaning, always cleaning

463
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:50,235
I told you not to get
too carried away

464
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:52,111
It's hopeless

465
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:55,073
How humiliating

466
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:59,035
It's not so very bad

467
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:09,796
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way

468
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:14,801
I'm done for. What's the point
in living, if you aren't beautiful...

469
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:29,232
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

470
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:31,609
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness

471
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:34,779
He did this last time
a girl ditched him

472
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:40,159
Please, Howl, that's enough

473
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:44,122
You can just dye your hair again

474
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:56,801
I've had enough of you, Howl!

475
00:47:57,093 --> 00:48:00,138
I've never once been beautiful!

476
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:03,683
I've had enough of this place!

477
00:48:43,222 --> 00:48:46,851
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind Scarecrow

478
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:49,854
Please come back, Sophie
Howl's in trouble!

479
00:48:50,355 --> 00:48:53,399
Cut it out, Howl
I'm going out

480
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:55,860
Sophie!

481
00:48:56,944 --> 00:48:58,279
Get over here

482
00:49:00,531 --> 00:49:01,824
My, he's dramatic

483
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:03,117
Is he dead?

484
00:49:03,117 --> 00:49:06,371
Don't worry
A tantrum never killed anyone

485
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,789
Help me, Markl

486
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:14,420
Get that hot water running, Markl

487
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:17,757
C'mon, you can still walk

488
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,104
You look after him now, Markl

489
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:32,355
Sure

490
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,900
I'll have to clean all over again

491
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:00,717
I'm coming in

492
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:11,686
Here's some hot milk
Drink up

493
00:50:14,772 --> 00:50:18,651
I'll leave it here
Drink it while it's hot

494
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:24,157
Don't leave me, Sophie

495
00:50:32,123 --> 00:50:33,833
Try a little milk?

496
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:47,013
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house

497
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:51,809
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port

498
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:54,645
The truth is, I'm a coward

499
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:58,316
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away

500
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:00,526
I'm scared to death

501
00:51:02,153 --> 00:51:05,531
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

502
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:10,077
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her

503
00:51:10,453 --> 00:51:14,040
But she terrified me
and I ran away

504
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:19,921
Now the king's ordered
me to report to him

505
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:22,924
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

506
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:25,259
How many names do you use, Howl?

507
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:28,012
Enough to guarantee my freedom

508
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:31,349
Can't you refuse the king?

509
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:32,892
See that...

510
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:37,647
The oath I took at
the Sorcery Academy

511
00:51:39,857 --> 00:51:42,527
Say, Howl
Why not visit the king?

512
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:43,861
What!

513
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:46,489
Just say it to his face

514
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:50,368
“Stop this foolish war
I refuse to help you”

515
00:51:52,662 --> 00:51:55,248
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like

516
00:51:55,873 --> 00:52:00,878
But he's the king, right? A king thinks
only of what's best for his people

517
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:02,880
I know!

518
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,216
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

519
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:09,428
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother

520
00:52:09,804 --> 00:52:13,224
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing

521
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:16,227
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me

522
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:18,563
Madam Suliman?

523
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:23,860
You're wearing that hat?

524
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,237
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

525
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:27,321
Off I go

526
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:28,406
Sure

527
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,366
See you later!

528
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:41,419
This charm
assures your safe return

529
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:46,299
Don't worry, I'll follow you in disguise

530
00:52:46,591 --> 00:52:48,092
There
Off you go!

531
00:52:56,142 --> 00:52:58,936
I'm sure this will never work

532
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:11,115
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow

533
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:20,291
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

534
00:53:26,672 --> 00:53:27,965
Not that...

535
00:53:39,518 --> 00:53:42,313
The Palace is so far away

536
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:27,191
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl

537
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:35,574
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things

538
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:38,369
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

539
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:44,750
How nice to see you
The little hatter, right?

540
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,711
The Witch of the Waste!

541
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:49,880
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl

542
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:54,343
How's Howl doing?

543
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:56,220
Quite terrified

544
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:59,807
Thanks to you,
I've become a cleaning lady

545
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,727
My how delightful

546
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,981
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

547
00:55:06,981 --> 00:55:10,568
Job hunting
I'm sick of working for Howl

548
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:11,736
And yourself?

549
00:55:12,236 --> 00:55:14,697
The king invited me

550
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:19,744
It seems that idiot, Suliman,
finally needs my power

551
00:55:19,994 --> 00:55:23,372
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me

552
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,291
That's impossible

553
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:29,503
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them

554
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:32,048
See you later, then

555
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:35,926
Hey, wait a minute
Just wait!

556
00:55:37,053 --> 00:55:39,764
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane

557
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,241
What's wrong with you?

558
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:02,745
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point

559
00:56:02,745 --> 00:56:04,455
Please continue on foot

560
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,123
That Suliman

561
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:09,960
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs

562
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:23,849
We'll catch up
Pay her no mind

563
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:52,044
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

564
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:05,850
You... Hey... Wait

565
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,685
What is it?

566
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:11,856
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

567
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:15,442
I told you...

568
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,861
I don't know how

569
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:19,029
Then, start studying up

570
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:25,953
I don't get it

571
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:29,165
Where does she get all that energy?

572
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:39,258
I have to put you down

573
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:49,393
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it

574
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:54,899
It's been 50 years now,
since they drove me out of here...

575
00:57:55,107 --> 00:58:00,196
I've been longing for this day...
Ever since

576
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:01,739
Good luck to you, then

577
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:05,284
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out

578
00:58:05,784 --> 00:58:07,119
Come, Howl

579
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,706
You heartless wench

580
00:58:10,706 --> 00:58:13,417
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too

581
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:36,440
Hurry up!

582
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:39,318
Madam, follow me

583
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:42,821
First, you should help her

584
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:45,616
We are forbidden to assist anyone

585
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,953
But the king himself invited her

586
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:51,747
Hang in there!

587
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:54,291
Just a little farther

588
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:57,503
And you call yourself a witch?

589
00:58:58,671 --> 00:59:00,589
Who asked you?

590
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:05,261
You suddenly look older

591
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:09,431
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

592
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:12,518
Pull yourself together

593
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:14,770
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

594
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:21,568
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

595
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:25,781
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar

596
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:29,493
Of course it does
That was the name of my hat shop

597
00:59:29,493 --> 00:59:30,703
It was?

598
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:32,997
Please wait here

599
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:40,629
A chair!

600
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:42,589
It's mine!

601
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:56,478
Howl, get back here

602
01:00:04,528 --> 01:00:06,238
Madam, this way please

603
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,759
I understand you're Howl's mother

604
01:01:09,676 --> 01:01:11,762
Yes
My name is Pendragon

605
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:14,765
I'm sure you're weary
Please have a seat

606
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:16,266
Yes

607
01:01:26,193 --> 01:01:29,738
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch

608
01:01:35,828 --> 01:01:37,287
Um, that dog is...

609
01:01:37,913 --> 01:01:39,206
Ah, you mean Heen?

610
01:01:39,456 --> 01:01:43,127
He does my errands
I asked him to escort you

611
01:01:47,297 --> 01:01:49,633
Howl won't join us, then?

612
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:54,179
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses

613
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:57,141
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty

614
01:01:58,308 --> 01:02:00,477
What a shame

615
01:02:00,936 --> 01:02:03,981
He was my lest apprentice...

616
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:08,485
A student of such marvelous gifts

617
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:12,531
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir

618
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,120
But then, a demon stole his heart,

619
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,164
and he abandoned me

620
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:24,501
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses

621
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:28,380
Mrs. Pendragon

622
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:30,674
That boy is dangerous

623
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:34,636
His power is too great
for one with no heart

624
01:02:36,054 --> 01:02:40,434
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste

625
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:41,143
Bring her

626
01:02:47,691 --> 01:02:49,359
What happened?

627
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:54,323
I just restored her to her real age

628
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:56,325
All her powers are gone

629
01:02:56,783 --> 01:03:00,829
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch

630
01:03:01,246 --> 01:03:04,082
She made a bargain with a demon

631
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:07,419
who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago

632
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:11,423
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

633
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:13,258
to disreputable wizards and witches

634
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,095
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

635
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:20,057
I will teach him how to break
with the demon

636
01:03:20,432 --> 01:03:24,353
If hot, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers

637
01:03:25,521 --> 01:03:26,563
Now just a minute

638
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:31,193
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here

639
01:03:31,652 --> 01:03:33,237
Something's not right

640
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:37,699
Forcing your aged guests to climb
stairs, dragging them into strange rooms

641
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:39,076
It's like a trap

642
01:03:39,368 --> 01:03:41,411
You call Howl heartless!

643
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:45,582
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable

644
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:49,086
But he's straight as an arrow
He only wants to be free

645
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,089
Howl won't turn into an evil monster

646
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:54,925
He'll battle the demon on his own

647
01:03:55,217 --> 01:03:57,094
I believe in him

648
01:03:57,636 --> 01:04:00,389
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl

649
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:04,268
Howl...
Howl's coming?

650
01:04:04,476 --> 01:04:07,563
I want Howl's heart, I want it

651
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:11,441
That's enough from you
Howl's not coming

652
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:15,070
Howl will most certainly come

653
01:04:15,946 --> 01:04:18,615
Now, I've found his weakness

654
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:26,456
Your Majesty

655
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:27,916
As you are

656
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,793
How are you feeling?

657
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:31,169
Thank you for asking

658
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:34,631
Meetings bore me
I flew out for e breather

659
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:36,633
How lovely

660
01:04:36,633 --> 01:04:37,884
These are?

661
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:40,971
This is Wizard Howl's mother

662
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,139
I see

663
01:04:46,184 --> 01:04:50,814
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic

664
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,819
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs

665
01:04:56,028 --> 01:04:58,697
But they just fall on neighboring towns

666
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:01,366
That's how magic works
Right, Suliman?

667
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:03,827
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty

668
01:05:03,827 --> 01:05:05,329
Suliman!

669
01:05:08,332 --> 01:05:12,294
This is the final battle
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp

670
01:05:15,213 --> 01:05:19,468
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news

671
01:05:19,468 --> 01:05:20,844
Thank you kindly

672
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:23,347
Have my generals assembled?

673
01:05:27,351 --> 01:05:29,895
It's been awhile, Howl

674
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:32,314
Delighted to see you doing so well

675
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:34,733
I saw right through you

676
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:36,693
I've kept my oath

677
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:39,696
I've no wish to fight you

678
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:41,198
I'll take my mother

679
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:42,866
I won't let you go

680
01:06:04,638 --> 01:06:06,765
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down

681
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:10,268
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are

682
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:07,284
Howl, don't! It's a trap

683
01:07:20,464 --> 01:07:21,631
Hold tight

684
01:07:29,431 --> 01:07:31,141
Sophie, sit up front

685
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:36,563
Oh, ho, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along

686
01:07:38,106 --> 01:07:39,441
Nice doggie

687
01:07:39,983 --> 01:07:42,903
You're just Suliman's spy

688
01:07:43,153 --> 01:07:45,822
Oh, well, too late to toss you now

689
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:47,657
Sophie, you steer

690
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:50,160
What! I can't possibly!

691
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,411
They're after us

692
01:07:56,708 --> 01:08:00,086
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes

693
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:02,130
What! That's impossible!

694
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,300
Don't worry, the ring will guide you

695
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,677
Summon Calcifer with your heart

696
01:08:07,677 --> 01:08:09,262
Summon Calcifer?

697
01:08:12,516 --> 01:08:13,558
It's glowing

698
01:08:15,101 --> 01:08:18,188
Follow the light
You'll be there by nightfall

699
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:21,691
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

700
01:08:21,691 --> 01:08:24,319
Your presence gave me
the courage for it

701
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,822
She's too terrible to
face on my own

702
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:31,409
You've saved me
I was in grave danger back there

703
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:34,371
Don't let go!

704
01:08:41,545 --> 01:08:43,255
- You're good
- Stop joking!

705
01:08:45,715 --> 01:08:47,425
We've got a lead now

706
01:08:47,717 --> 01:08:50,595
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
now's your chance

707
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:55,600
HOWL!

708
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,698
No, thank you

709
01:09:10,073 --> 01:09:13,618
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages

710
01:09:13,994 --> 01:09:16,538
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

711
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,125
His mother's awfully young

712
01:10:10,926 --> 01:10:13,261
We're not far
That's my hometown

713
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:20,143
Don't look so friendly
I don't trust you

714
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:46,127
The castle
They've come to meet us

715
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,134
Sophie!

716
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:54,886
Markl, help!

717
01:10:55,178 --> 01:10:57,138
I don't know how to stop this thing!

718
01:11:09,526 --> 01:11:10,986
Sophie!

719
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,029
Doggie

720
01:11:15,365 --> 01:11:16,408
Markl

721
01:11:17,325 --> 01:11:18,702
I'm home

722
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,996
Sophie, are you hurt?

723
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:23,039
You're home!

724
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:25,625
Thank you for coming to meet us

725
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:59,242
Oh, no, you've gone too far

726
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:19,929
I wonder if Howl's back

727
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:15,652
Howl?

728
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:19,883
Howl? Is it you?

729
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:25,221
Are you hurt? In pain?

730
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:28,391
Stay away

731
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:30,310
I want to help you

732
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,562
I want to break the spell you're under

733
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:37,066
You can't even break your own spell

734
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,569
But I love you!

735
01:14:39,861 --> 01:14:41,779
Too late

736
01:14:45,867 --> 01:14:47,243
HOWL!

737
01:15:00,381 --> 01:15:02,091
Howl must be back

738
01:15:02,091 --> 01:15:06,596
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick

739
01:15:07,055 --> 01:15:09,349
We're both running out of time

740
01:15:09,349 --> 01:15:12,268
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

741
01:15:12,268 --> 01:15:15,813
I can't tell you that
I'm a demon

742
01:15:17,607 --> 01:15:20,026
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

743
01:15:20,026 --> 01:15:23,112
Howl has given you
something very precious

744
01:15:23,112 --> 01:15:25,114
What is it?
Where is it?

745
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:28,034
That's confidential information

746
01:15:28,034 --> 01:15:30,703
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

747
01:15:30,703 --> 01:15:33,456
How dare you!
Howl will die with me

748
01:15:53,309 --> 01:15:54,936
Good morning, Turnip

749
01:15:54,936 --> 01:15:56,521
We've got to be brave

750
01:16:00,233 --> 01:16:02,527
Ready, Sophie!

751
01:16:02,527 --> 01:16:05,863
OK! Open wider, Calcifer

752
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:10,118
Here goes! Push!

753
01:16:10,118 --> 01:16:11,828
Heave!

754
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:24,007
I... said... move!

755
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:26,009
Come on!

756
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:51,367
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap

757
01:16:53,953 --> 01:16:56,372
It's time to eat!

758
01:17:02,587 --> 01:17:04,339
Here, old girl

759
01:17:05,131 --> 01:17:08,092
But, Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste

760
01:17:08,426 --> 01:17:10,053
No need to worry

761
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:12,221
Why's she staring at me?

762
01:17:12,472 --> 01:17:14,807
Such a pretty fire

763
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,686
Howl

764
01:17:18,686 --> 01:17:20,021
Hello, everyone

765
01:17:20,021 --> 01:17:21,105
Welcome home

766
01:17:21,105 --> 01:17:23,274
Master Howl,
can we keep this puppy?

767
01:17:23,858 --> 01:17:26,903
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog

768
01:17:26,903 --> 01:17:29,280
VVhy'd you let them in, Calcifer?

769
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:33,576
Don't look at me!
They blew in with Sophie

770
01:17:36,371 --> 01:17:38,081
Sophie, always dramatic...

771
01:17:38,581 --> 01:17:41,167
So you're Turnip

772
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:45,755
You're under quite a spell, too

773
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:48,925
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

774
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,135
He's so handsome

775
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:54,972
This is a busy day
We're moving

776
01:17:54,972 --> 01:17:56,057
Moving?

777
01:17:56,057 --> 01:17:59,310
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere

778
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:03,189
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here

779
01:18:03,398 --> 01:18:07,610
But you'll have to stay behind
The magic in your spell's too risky

780
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:15,284
All right, that's done

781
01:18:15,827 --> 01:18:18,079
Take it away, Calcifer

782
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:34,762
Excehent

783
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:36,431
Stay right where you are

784
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:41,769
Be gentle...

785
01:18:45,231 --> 01:18:46,441
Here goes

786
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,362
We've moved
You can get up now

787
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:38,159
Amazing, Master
It's so grand

788
01:19:38,659 --> 01:19:41,370
What a pretty fire

789
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:56,552
This is...

790
01:19:56,928 --> 01:20:00,556
I added a bathroom
For our growing family

791
01:20:00,765 --> 01:20:03,935
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

792
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:10,233
I added a bedroom, too
Go in

793
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,411
This is... why?

794
01:20:22,703 --> 01:20:25,873
I thought it would suit you
Do you like it?

795
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:30,378
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper

796
01:20:30,711 --> 01:20:33,756
I got you new clothes, too
Open them later. Next

797
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:37,301
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

798
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:39,720
A courtyard!

799
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,264
There's a shop, too

800
01:20:41,931 --> 01:20:43,599
Let's go, Heen!

801
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:47,186
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit

802
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:53,609
My gift to you, Sophie
Step outside

803
01:21:18,801 --> 01:21:20,678
It's my secret garden

804
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:23,055
Beautiful

805
01:21:25,224 --> 01:21:27,435
Did you make it with your magic?

806
01:21:27,977 --> 01:21:30,605
Only a little, to help the flowers

807
01:21:39,947 --> 01:21:42,158
Thank you, Howl!

808
01:21:42,575 --> 01:21:44,160
It's like I'm dreaming

809
01:22:07,058 --> 01:22:08,351
Sophie

810
01:22:09,685 --> 01:22:13,773
How mysterious
I feel I've been here before

811
01:22:14,273 --> 01:22:16,192
I could cry with happiness

812
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:17,443
Come

813
01:22:26,035 --> 01:22:27,036
Look

814
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,959
A sweet little house

815
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,212
My favorite hideaway

816
01:22:36,712 --> 01:22:40,174
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone

817
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:43,177
Alone?

818
01:22:43,969 --> 01:22:47,807
My Uncle, the Wizard,
left it to me in secret

819
01:22:48,057 --> 01:22:50,643
Make yourself at home there, Sophie

820
01:22:54,397 --> 01:22:55,523
What's wrong?

821
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:57,274
I'm scared

822
01:22:57,274 --> 01:23:00,403
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside

823
01:23:03,072 --> 01:23:05,408
Howl, tell me the truth

824
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:08,411
I don't mind if you're a monster

825
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:17,628
I want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably

826
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,924
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

827
01:23:22,383 --> 01:23:24,927
You'd be good at it, Sophie

828
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:27,096
And then, you'd go away?

829
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:31,809
I want to help you, Howl

830
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:36,147
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

831
01:23:36,564 --> 01:23:39,191
Sophie, you are beautiful

832
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,949
The good thing about being old
is that you've so little to lose...

833
01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:02,548
Why's that flying here?

834
01:24:02,548 --> 01:24:03,507
A battleship?

835
01:24:03,507 --> 01:24:05,092
On its way to burn cities and people

836
01:24:05,426 --> 01:24:06,719
The enemy's'? Ours?

837
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,804
What difference does it make?

838
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:22,610
Murderers

839
01:24:29,992 --> 01:24:32,953
Look at all those bombs

840
01:24:48,886 --> 01:24:50,304
It stopped

841
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,555
Did you do that?

842
01:24:51,889 --> 01:24:54,558
I'm just tinkering
It won't crash

843
01:24:57,978 --> 01:24:59,104
HOWL!

844
01:24:59,104 --> 01:25:01,732
Oops, looks like they're onto us

845
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:14,537
Madam Suliman's deputies
Let's go back

846
01:25:14,537 --> 01:25:16,539
Run! Move those legs

847
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,346
Hurry on in!

848
01:25:32,346 --> 01:25:33,973
No! Don't let go!

849
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:45,276
What happened, Sophie?

850
01:25:46,485 --> 01:25:48,237
I've had it with this place!

851
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,665
Good night, Sophie

852
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:01,375
Good night

853
01:26:03,252 --> 01:26:07,882
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end

854
01:26:08,674 --> 01:26:10,384
Thank you, Markl

855
01:26:10,593 --> 01:26:11,719
Need the toilet?

856
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:13,262
I'm fine

857
01:26:13,262 --> 01:26:14,930
Good night

858
01:26:15,472 --> 01:26:16,473
You're in love

859
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:22,771
Sighing away like that

860
01:26:34,408 --> 01:26:36,327
I thought so

861
01:26:36,327 --> 01:26:38,871
Were you ever in love?

862
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:41,832
Of course I was
I'm still in love

863
01:26:41,832 --> 01:26:42,958
What?

864
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,295
Men, why ever should we went them...

865
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:48,964
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

866
01:26:49,465 --> 01:26:50,966
Unbelievable

867
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:53,552
And so adorable, too

868
01:26:57,306 --> 01:26:58,682
What is that?

869
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:00,309
Air raid siren

870
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:02,186
Air raid?

871
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:07,691
It's not for here
But best not go out tonight

872
01:27:09,193 --> 01:27:13,822
Suliman's creatures are searching
high and low for our house

873
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:20,829
What a good fire,
hiding us so well

874
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:58,534
Sophie, a stranger got in!

875
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:07,084
Mother

876
01:28:07,376 --> 01:28:09,545
Sophie!

877
01:28:11,714 --> 01:28:14,842
Where have you been!
I searched for you everywhere!

878
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:17,845
But, oh, look how you've aged!

879
01:28:18,303 --> 01:28:20,264
It's all my fault

880
01:28:22,224 --> 01:28:24,810
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

881
01:28:25,394 --> 01:28:26,937
Mother...

882
01:28:29,314 --> 01:28:31,567
I barely recognize the house

883
01:28:31,775 --> 01:28:33,235
Who is that?

884
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,404
Oh, your landlady

885
01:28:35,821 --> 01:28:39,074
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

886
01:28:39,366 --> 01:28:42,244
He's such a wonderful man
And he's rich, too!

887
01:28:42,244 --> 01:28:43,912
We can all live together again

888
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:46,707
You'll never have to clean again

889
01:28:47,249 --> 01:28:50,085
But I'm happy here...

890
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:52,087
Really?

891
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:53,380
Oops, I forgot

892
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,799
My car's waiting
I've got to run

893
01:29:00,304 --> 01:29:03,932
I'm so glad I found you again

894
01:29:03,932 --> 01:29:06,101
We'll really catch up next time

895
01:29:06,101 --> 01:29:08,395
In the meantime, you take care

896
01:29:13,942 --> 01:29:17,905
A peeping-bug, eh?
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman

897
01:29:18,113 --> 01:29:19,782
All yours, Cal

898
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:31,794
May you find happiness, Mother

899
01:29:31,794 --> 01:29:34,088
Thank you
You too, Sophie

900
01:29:38,425 --> 01:29:41,345
I've done what I was told
Take me back to my husband

901
01:29:41,762 --> 01:29:44,681
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased

902
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,685
Forgive me, Sophie...

903
01:29:52,689 --> 01:29:54,149
Look at all these people

904
01:29:54,775 --> 01:29:58,195
They're all running away
The town will be empty

905
01:29:58,195 --> 01:29:59,988
Do you wish to run, too?

906
01:30:01,448 --> 01:30:03,659
That's what that lady spoke of...

907
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:07,454
So, she did
I'm glad we made up

908
01:30:07,704 --> 01:30:09,414
Don't go, Sophie!

909
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:13,669
I love you, Sophie
Please stay

910
01:30:15,337 --> 01:30:18,340
I love you, too, Markl
Don't worry, I won't go

911
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,508
Really!

912
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:22,344
Are we a family?

913
01:30:22,344 --> 01:30:24,179
Yes, we're family

914
01:30:24,638 --> 01:30:25,806
Oh, good!

915
01:30:34,356 --> 01:30:37,025
I'll never let Suliman
get hold of Howl

916
01:30:53,876 --> 01:30:56,253
But the paper says we won

917
01:30:56,253 --> 01:30:59,089
Only fools swallow such lies

918
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:03,760
How strange
I can't get Calcifer going

919
01:31:04,344 --> 01:31:06,388
Grandma, will you stop that?

920
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:08,056
Such an awful stink

921
01:31:08,056 --> 01:31:11,059
Why deny an old lady her pleasures

922
01:31:11,643 --> 01:31:13,228
Open the window, Markl

923
01:31:17,357 --> 01:31:19,735
I wouldn't open that now...

924
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:26,074
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly keep them out

925
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:29,161
Markl!

926
01:31:39,922 --> 01:31:41,256
Close it quick!

927
01:31:47,638 --> 01:31:50,432
Look after Grandma, Markl
I'll check on the shop

928
01:32:09,243 --> 01:32:12,996
How dare you, now? If you've
energy to spare, put out the fires

929
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:38,647
HOWL!

930
01:32:52,327 --> 01:32:53,829
Dramatic as usual...

931
01:33:07,175 --> 01:33:08,010
HOWL!

932
01:33:10,178 --> 01:33:12,556
I'm sorry
I had too many enemies, tonight

933
01:33:13,348 --> 01:33:16,226
Howl, oh, Howl

934
01:33:33,076 --> 01:33:35,120
Master Howl!
Sophie!

935
01:33:37,873 --> 01:33:41,001
Calcifer, be strong

936
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:49,843
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

937
01:33:50,302 --> 01:33:53,388
That granny fed me something nasty

938
01:33:53,972 --> 01:33:56,391
Why, if it isn't HOWL

939
01:33:56,892 --> 01:34:00,604
I feel we need a nice long chat

940
01:34:01,229 --> 01:34:04,983
Likewise, Madam
But we've no time, now

941
01:34:05,525 --> 01:34:09,821
How unlike you
You're not running away

942
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:11,323
Until later, then

943
01:34:12,449 --> 01:34:15,577
Stay here, Sophie
Calcifer will protect you

944
01:34:15,577 --> 01:34:17,371
I'll see to things outside

945
01:34:19,164 --> 01:34:20,582
Wait, Howl!

946
01:34:20,582 --> 01:34:22,959
Don't go! Please stay

947
01:34:23,668 --> 01:34:27,130
Another round of bombs is coming
Even Calcifer can't stop those

948
01:34:27,506 --> 01:34:29,466
Let's run away
Don't fight

949
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:32,469
I'm through running away

950
01:34:33,053 --> 01:34:35,806
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

951
01:34:36,264 --> 01:34:37,516
You

952
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,313
HOWL!

953
01:36:07,939 --> 01:36:09,357
That's our town

954
01:36:13,945 --> 01:36:15,155
There's Howl

955
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:25,582
HOWL!

956
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:37,427
Sophie!
Turnip...

957
01:36:41,223 --> 01:36:43,016
Markl, come inside!

958
01:36:43,225 --> 01:36:46,353
Move? You're nuts
There's nothing there

959
01:36:46,353 --> 01:36:49,731
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting

960
01:36:50,065 --> 01:36:51,608
He's better off a coward

961
01:36:51,816 --> 01:36:53,235
Grandma, get up

962
01:36:53,527 --> 01:36:55,070
Going for a stroll?

963
01:36:55,445 --> 01:36:57,447
Suliman will find us, right away

964
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:01,243
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive

965
01:37:01,243 --> 01:37:02,577
Sophie!

966
01:37:02,577 --> 01:37:04,120
The castle's falling apart

967
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,331
That's all right
Markl, take Grandma

968
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:07,332
Sure

969
01:37:09,584 --> 01:37:11,086
You, too, hop up now

970
01:37:11,461 --> 01:37:15,090
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace

971
01:37:15,507 --> 01:37:18,093
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you

972
01:37:19,135 --> 01:37:20,053
Watch it!

973
01:37:20,303 --> 01:37:22,430
Cut it out! Cut it out!

974
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:25,725
If I leave, the house will collapse

975
01:37:25,725 --> 01:37:26,601
Fine!

976
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,023
We're out

977
01:37:32,023 --> 01:37:34,109
I'd better go last

978
01:37:35,151 --> 01:37:38,446
Even I don't know what'll happen...

979
01:38:07,267 --> 01:38:09,644
I told you, it would collapse

980
01:38:09,644 --> 01:38:10,979
Rain!

981
01:38:13,565 --> 01:38:15,233
Is that heading for town?

982
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:16,943
Look after Grandma, Markl

983
01:38:16,943 --> 01:38:18,862
Turnip, find us a way in

984
01:38:19,904 --> 01:38:22,324
Don't worry, Grandma
I'll take care of you

985
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:27,412
Markl, we can get in here

986
01:38:37,172 --> 01:38:39,841
The roof's leaking
I'll go out

987
01:38:40,258 --> 01:38:41,635
Wait here

988
01:38:41,635 --> 01:38:42,969
It's wet here...

989
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:51,102
Hurry

990
01:38:53,271 --> 01:38:54,898
Too damp

991
01:38:58,526 --> 01:39:00,362
Bring Grandma here, Markl

992
01:39:00,654 --> 01:39:02,322
The castle's empty

993
01:39:02,781 --> 01:39:06,159
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it

994
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:11,206
Calcifer, please
You're my last hope

995
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,376
I want to go to Howl
Move the castle

996
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:19,339
I know you can do it
You're so strong

997
01:39:19,714 --> 01:39:22,550
But there's no chimney here...

998
01:39:23,218 --> 01:39:24,678
And the wood's damp...

999
01:39:25,345 --> 01:39:29,724
As the saying goes, “The best
blaze brightest in adversity”

1000
01:39:29,724 --> 01:39:32,060
I've heard that, but...

1001
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,853
You really think so?

1002
01:39:33,853 --> 01:39:35,980
You're so pretty, Cal

1003
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,232
Sit here, Grandma

1004
01:39:37,732 --> 01:39:40,485
Then, give me something of yours,
Sophie

1005
01:39:40,485 --> 01:39:41,528
Of mine?

1006
01:39:41,528 --> 01:39:44,239
I can't do it alone
How about your eyes?

1007
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:45,573
My eyes?

1008
01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:46,658
This?

1009
01:40:52,474 --> 01:40:55,185
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

1010
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:58,688
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart

1011
01:40:58,688 --> 01:41:01,649
Heart! You have a heart?

1012
01:41:04,444 --> 01:41:06,154
Oh, my!

1013
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:21,044
There's Howl
He's trapped

1014
01:41:26,341 --> 01:41:28,176
Hurry, Calcifer!

1015
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,178
Don't!

1016
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:32,055
Grandma!

1017
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,973
Stop it!

1018
01:41:34,808 --> 01:41:36,768
Howl's heart

1019
01:41:38,019 --> 01:41:39,687
Cut it out!

1020
01:41:48,863 --> 01:41:49,864
Grandma!

1021
01:41:52,075 --> 01:41:53,910
It's hot, hot!

1022
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:55,703
Let go!

1023
01:41:56,204 --> 01:41:57,747
You'll die, Grandma

1024
01:41:57,747 --> 01:42:00,041
No, it's mine!

1025
01:42:18,268 --> 01:42:19,811
Sophie!

1026
01:42:23,523 --> 01:42:24,774
Sophie!

1027
01:42:25,483 --> 01:42:28,820
She's so mean
That's mine

1028
01:43:12,071 --> 01:43:15,742
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done
I poured water on Calcifer

1029
01:43:18,745 --> 01:43:21,623
What if I've killed Howl, too...

1030
01:43:48,107 --> 01:43:50,526
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

1031
01:43:50,902 --> 01:43:52,403
Show me where he is

1032
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,010
The castle door...

1033
01:45:34,422 --> 01:45:35,423
Heen...

1034
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:11,959
Howl...

1035
01:46:30,603 --> 01:46:33,147
This must be Howl's childhood...

1036
01:47:52,185 --> 01:47:54,061
Howl!
Calcifer!

1037
01:47:56,147 --> 01:47:59,692
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you

1038
01:48:01,194 --> 01:48:03,196
Wait for me in the future!

1039
01:48:36,187 --> 01:48:38,856
I'll walk there
Heen, I'll walk

1040
01:48:39,523 --> 01:48:41,234
I can't stop crying

1041
01:49:05,591 --> 01:49:06,634
Howl

1042
01:49:13,474 --> 01:49:16,102
I'm sorry I took so long

1043
01:49:16,644 --> 01:49:18,938
You've been waiting all this time

1044
01:49:23,901 --> 01:49:26,654
Take me to Calcifer

1045
01:50:29,633 --> 01:50:30,718
Is he dead?

1046
01:50:30,718 --> 01:50:32,219
No, he's fine

1047
01:50:36,891 --> 01:50:38,267
Grandma...

1048
01:50:38,267 --> 01:50:41,520
Don't look at me
I don't have anything

1049
01:50:42,396 --> 01:50:43,397
Please

1050
01:50:45,816 --> 01:50:47,276
Grandma

1051
01:50:50,071 --> 01:50:52,740
You want it that badly?

1052
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:53,908
Yes

1053
01:50:54,742 --> 01:50:58,329
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it

1054
01:50:59,246 --> 01:51:00,456
There

1055
01:51:01,916 --> 01:51:04,085
Thank you, Grandma

1056
01:51:20,267 --> 01:51:21,769
Calcifer

1057
01:51:22,937 --> 01:51:25,773
Sophie...
I'm all worn out

1058
01:51:25,773 --> 01:51:28,943
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1059
01:51:29,276 --> 01:51:31,821
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie

1060
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:36,784
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me

1061
01:51:36,784 --> 01:51:38,369
I'd better try, then

1062
01:51:41,664 --> 01:51:45,084
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird

1063
01:51:45,084 --> 01:51:47,336
It's still only a child's heart

1064
01:51:48,295 --> 01:51:51,465
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1065
01:51:51,465 --> 01:51:54,510
and may Howl recover his heart...

1066
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:07,356
I'm alive!

1067
01:52:07,356 --> 01:52:09,024
I'm free!

1068
01:52:15,489 --> 01:52:17,241
He moved, he's alive!

1069
01:52:21,996 --> 01:52:23,831
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1070
01:52:38,679 --> 01:52:39,680
Turnip!

1071
01:52:52,693 --> 01:52:54,236
Turnip, are you OK?

1072
01:52:54,236 --> 01:52:56,197
I'll get you a new stick, right away

1073
01:52:58,824 --> 01:53:00,367
Thank you, Turnip

1074
01:53:08,834 --> 01:53:10,377
Thank you, Sophie

1075
01:53:11,504 --> 01:53:13,714
I'm a prince from the next kingdom

1076
01:53:13,714 --> 01:53:16,217
A cruel spell turned me
into a Scarecrow

1077
01:53:16,217 --> 01:53:17,259
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break

1078
01:53:17,259 --> 01:53:19,470
“beyond these fears ” A spell that
only your beloved's kiss could break

1079
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:19,595
“beyond these fears ”

1080
01:53:19,595 --> 01:53:22,640
“beyond these fears ” Exactly.
And if Sophie hadn't saved me, I would have died

1081
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,266
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
I would have died

1082
01:53:24,558 --> 01:53:26,852
“my flickering smile”
My, you're good-looking

1083
01:53:26,852 --> 01:53:27,019
“my flickering smile”

1084
01:53:27,019 --> 01:53:29,730
“my flickering smile” What
a racket What's the fuss?

1085
01:53:30,606 --> 01:53:31,315
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1086
01:53:31,315 --> 01:53:33,067
“holds the promise of love”
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1087
01:53:33,067 --> 01:53:33,442
“holds the promise of love”

1088
01:53:33,442 --> 01:53:35,778
“holds the promise of love”
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden

1089
01:53:36,153 --> 01:53:38,239
Oh, Sophie, your hair is
