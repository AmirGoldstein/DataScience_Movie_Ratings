00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,100
<i>The latest ceasefire
came too late to save these villages...</i>

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,774
<i>Today,
President Clinton voiced concerns</i>

3
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>at the deteriorating
situation in Sarajevo...</i>

4
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,284
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,</i>

5
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:40,122
<i>why do I hate all the Tutsi,
I say, "Read our history."</i>

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,292
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.</i>

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,295
<i>They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.</i>

8
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,673
<i>Now, they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.</i>

9
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,010
<i>They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.</i>

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,096
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.</i>

11
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,681
<i>We are the majority.</i>

12
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,351
<i>They are a minority
of traitors and invaders.</i>

13
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,024
<i>We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

15
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,114
<i>Stay alert. Watch your neighbors.</i>

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,262
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir. Thank you.

17
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,339
- Thank you.
- These are for you, sir.

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,237
- They're fresh from Havana.
- Wonderful.

19
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,447
Next time you are there,
tell Fidel I said hello.

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,866
Good to see you, gentlemen.

21
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,310
Oh, that is a fine cigar, sir.

22
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,439
This is a Cohiba cigar.
Each one is worth 10,000 francs.

23
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,400
Ten thousand francs?

24
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,736
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

25
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,530
What do you mean, sir?

26
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,078
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

27
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,413
He is rich.

28
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,124
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

29
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:52,087
straight from Havana, Cuba,
hey, that is style, Dube.

30
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,131
Style.

31
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:08,770
- Cohiba, a fantastic cigar.
- The best, eh?

32
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,899
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

33
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,611
Uh... I will try my best, George,

34
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,281
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

35
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,784
Politics is power, Paul. Hutu power.

36
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,662
And money.

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,376
It's time for you to join your people.

38
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,004
Thank you, George.

39
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,423
But time is also money.

40
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,804
I need six extra cases of beer today,
along with the regular order.

41
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,435
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

42
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,605
I'm always glad to see you, Paul.

43
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,112
Hey! Hey! Put that back!

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,031
Put that back! That's not beer!

45
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,038
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,126
Paul, don't worry about the Carlsberg,
OK? I'll give you Heineken.

47
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,545
- And I won't charge you extra.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,219
A bargain buy from China.

49
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,637
Ten cents each.

50
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:29,768
- You know, I'll get at least 50.
- At least.

51
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,860
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

52
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,823
I've heard him on the radio telling
the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

53
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,993
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,120
Their time is soon over.

55
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,331
Anyway, this is business.

56
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,672
Oh, no.

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,424
Do as they say. Pull over.

58
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,529
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

59
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,617
Smile, Dube.
Don't attract attention to yourself.

60
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,577
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

61
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,288
Just smile as if they are friends.

62
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,838
- No!
- Tutsi, what are you doing here?

63
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,717
No, no, hey. Hey. Hutu power.
Hutu power!

64
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,637
Yes.

65
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,559
Get out of here.

66
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,944
There's water coming from the box.

67
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,405
Park here. We'll go in the front.

68
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,161
Gregoire, please help with this water.

69
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,121
Gregoire!

70
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,873
Deal with this right away.

71
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,834
We were hoping
to go see the gorilla.

72
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,047
Dube, this is the lobby.

73
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,926
- Paul, what's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

74
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,598
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

75
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,436
Ten alive, 12 are dead.

76
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,899
All right.

77
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,068
But save the shells.

78
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,820
Fill them with, uh...

79
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,573
...a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

80
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,327
- Cassava?
- And the fish.

81
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,579
- And tipali.
- Yes.

82
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,875
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

83
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,002
- Dube.
- Style, sir.

84
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,462
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,176
The problem is, General Bizimungu,

86
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,389
I have information
that the Interhamwe Militia

87
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,808
will not heed the peace agreement.

88
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,228
Colonel, the UN need not worry
about the Interhamwe.

89
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,688
We will control them.

90
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,940
- General.
- Ah! Paul.

91
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,109
This Scotch is exceptional.

92
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,487
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

93
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,865
Colonel Oliver, it is
a pleasure to see you, sir.

94
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,950
Good to see you, Paul.

95
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,704
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

96
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,622
It is spectacular,
straight off the plane.

97
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,333
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

98
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,668
Thank you.

99
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,546
I left a little something
for you at the coat check.

100
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,215
Excuse me, gentlemen.

101
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,470
I need flour.
Get me two bags of flour.

102
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,436
Good afternoon, ladies.

103
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,980
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

104
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,565
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,068
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

106
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,113

112
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,968
Hello, Mr. Paul.

113
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,068
- Hello, Jeremiah.
- Hello, sir.

114
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,784
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

115
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,411
See you soon.

116
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,290
So your brother
and the girls are here.

117
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,500
Yes.

118
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,463
Oh!

119
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,757
OK, let me see, your turn.

120
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,634
One, two, three.

121
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,264
Who is the winner?
Oh. It doesn't matter.

122
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,474
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

123
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,017
Watch this.

124
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,481
Oh, my goodness. Well, here.
Chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

125
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,984
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

126
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,445
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

127
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,949
- Thank you.
- OK, OK. Let's go in.

128
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,500
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

129
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,628
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

130
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,631
- Foreign press arriving for the...
- Soldiers!

131
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,009
- What?
- There are soldiers.

132
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,845
- Where?
- On the street.

133
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,352
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

134
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,023
We know you are Tutsi.

135
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,525
Please, sir, this is my husband.

136
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,278
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,864
- We do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

138
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,367
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any...

139
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,328
- What is it?
- Shut up!

140
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,039
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

141
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,041
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

142
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,962
No, Captain, you see...

143
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,965
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, captain.

144
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,801
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

145
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,209
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi cockroach.

146
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,308
- No! No!
- We must do something.

147
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,143
- Do what?
- Call someone.

148
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,063
I'm not going. I'm not going!

149
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,191
- No!
- Get him in the truck. Now!

150
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,901
Oh!

151
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,153
Oh...

152
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,031
Get him in the truck. Now!

153
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,950
We must do something.

154
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,458
There is nothing we can do.

155
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,170
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

156
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,384
No!

157
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,680
Why would they arrest Victor?

158
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,601
He has no politics. He's a gardener.

159
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,728
Who knows?

160
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,984
Who knows? Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

161
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,946
Happens all the time now.

162
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,869
And maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

163
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,455
It wouldn't help.

164
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,919
- You could ask as a favor.
- No, I could not.

165
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:59,008
All day long I work
to please this officer.

166
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,636
That diplomat, some tourist.

167
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,807
To store up favors, so if there
is a time when we need help,

168
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,809
I have powerful people I can call upon.

169
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,228
But Victor was a good neighbor.

170
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,566
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

171
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:20,613
Please. Please, leave
these things to my good judgment.

172
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,590
This assignment is bullshit.

173
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,676
Come on, a few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

174
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,432
Gentlemen,
welcome to the Mille Collines.

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,851
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

176
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,644
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,812
- How do you do?
- Anything that you need, find me.

178
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,398
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

179
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,951
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

180
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,372
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

181
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,125
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

182
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,878
- How?
- They picked people.

183
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,547
Those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

184
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,635
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

185
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,135
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

186
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,638
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

187
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,890
and of course the Hutus took revenge

188
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,226
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

189
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,144
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

190
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,564
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

191
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,985
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali. An expert on the subject.

192
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,988
So, what are you, Paul?

193
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,117
I am Hutu.

194
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,119
Gentlemen.

195
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,919
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

196
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,213
Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?

197
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,717
- I am Tutsi.
- And your friend, Tutsi?

198
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,386
No, I am Hutu.

199
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,016
- They could be twins.
- Get the camera.

200
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,769
The general's going
to give us an interview.

201
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,775
Hey, I'm in room 22.
I'd love to finish this conversation.

202
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,448
<i>Senior UN officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

203
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,785
<i>and arming the Hutu militia
called the Interhamwe.</i>

204
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:35,290
<i>I put this claim to the head of the
armed forces, General Bizimungu.</i>

205
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,127
<i>No. No, we have not been
training the militia.</i>

206
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,129
<i>The UN are mistaken in this accusation.</i>

207
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,630
<i>Do you support
your president's agreement</i>

208
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,798
<i>to make peace with the rebels?</i>

209
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,302
<i>The president has
the full support of the army.</i>

210
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,430
<i>That peace agreement
will be signed today in Tanzania</i>

211
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,808
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyarimana.</i>

212
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,730
This is a great day for Rwanda
and for all of Africa.

213
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,149
Negotiation has replaced
confrontation...

214
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,985
Paul, have a drink.

215
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,570
Friendship has replaced fear.

216
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

217
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,325
to the signing of the peace agreement.

218
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:16,456
- To our president. May he find peace.
- May we all find peace.

219
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:22,170
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

220
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,505
- To peace.
- Peace!

221
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,890
- I am planning on returning...
- Thank you. Hi.

222
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,558
Thomas.

223
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,187
Hello, Fedens.

224
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,983
- Well, this is a surprise.
- Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.

225
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,819
Yes, what's wrong?

226
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,697
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

227
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,408
- Who?
- This...

228
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,243
Thank you, Sullivan.

229
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,666
My assistant, the Hutu Power man.

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,669
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

231
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,213
Give me this man's name.

232
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,883
Please, Paul, even though
he is Interhamwe, he's a friend.

233
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,718
He wants your job, Thomas.

234
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,060
He said that there is a signal.

235
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,229
It is "cut the tall trees."

236
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,566
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

237
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,487
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

238
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,698
You are Hutu. You will be safe.

239
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,620
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

240
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,622
And I know what we have seen, Thomas.

241
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,458
But please,
the United Nations are here now.

242
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,961
The world press are watching.

243
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,047
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work...

244
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,716
What was that?

245
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,430
Power cuts.

246
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,725
We are running on generators.

247
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,185
Fedens...

248
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,646
Please, don't worry.

249
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,191
Tomorrow you will come by the house,

250
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,194
and we will discuss this
with Tatiana. All right?

251
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,868
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

252
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,147
Shit!

253
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:05,750
Stay in your houses. Stay in your house.
Everybody stay in your house!

254
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,866
Tatiana?

255
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,523
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

256
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,192
What is going on here?

257
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,760
- Our house has been burned.
- What?

258
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,572
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

259
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,992
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

260
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,869
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

261
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,497
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

262
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,086
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

263
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,422
Jean Baptiste, find them
seats in the other room.

264
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,591
Odette, please.

265
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,262
Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?

266
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,764
Yes. I told them to go home.

267
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,142
Go and call them, Tatsi.

268
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,519
I've tried. Our phones,
they do not work.

269
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,442
Why do the neighbors run to us?

270
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,777
You are the only Hutu they can trust.

271
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,446
You are a Tutsi.

272
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,908
They are scared, Paul. I am scared.

273
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,958
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

274
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,794
We must remain calm for the children.

275
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,924
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

276
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,259
Gone? Gone where?

277
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,971
- He was afraid for his friend, Simon.
- Where has he gone?

278
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,264
He went next door.

279
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,851
- Paul!
- Tatiana.

280
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,145
- Please.
- You have to stay here.

281
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,189
- Please...
- No, no!

282
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh, no, please.
Tell me what is wrong.

283
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,328
Oh, my son, where are you hurt?

284
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,205
Talk to me! Where are you hurt?!

285
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,506
Odette! Odette!

286
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,509
Oh, no.

287
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,637
Get his clothes off.
Please get some water. He's hurt.

288
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,807
- Please, let's get his clothes off.
- He's covered in blood.

289
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,436
- He wanted to talk to...
- Shh...

290
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,948
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

291
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,449
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

292
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,868
Tell your mother what happened. Roger.

293
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,581
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

294
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,543
This is not his blood.

295
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,212
You are not hurt!

296
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,799
My darling is OK. He's OK.

297
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,720
- Roger, look at your mother.
- Come here, Elys.

298
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,515
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

299
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,561
You are safe. You are safe.
You are safe, Roger.

300
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,355
You are safe, Roger. It's OK.

301
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,317
I love you.

302
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,588
Oh, son.

303
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,052
Paul.

304
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,388
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.</i>

305
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,599
<i>Terrible news...</i>

306
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,893
- It is true.
<i>- Horrible news...</i>

307
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:39,440
<i>Our great president is murdered
by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

308
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,816
Oh, my God!

309
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,445
<i>They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.</i>

310
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,198
<i>Then they shot his plane from the sky.</i>

311
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:52,745
<i>It is time to clear the brush,
good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

312
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,499
<i>We must cut the tall trees.</i>

313
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,462
<i>- Cut the tall trees now!</i>
- The soldiers are here!

314
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,340
<i>- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.</i>
- No, no.

315
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,259
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

316
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:11,639
<i>Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.</i>

317
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,267
Split up. Everybody out.

318
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,814
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

319
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,026
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,493
I... I better go have a word with them.

321
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,455
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

322
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,832
Yes, sir!

323
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,503
- Who's in charge here?
- You.

324
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,677
Can I help you, sir?

325
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,345
Everybody out! Out!

326
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,181
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

327
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,350
I am a good friend of General Bizimungu.

328
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,227
Get out!

329
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,023
Get out of here!

330
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,526
Everybody, out! Get out, get out!

331
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,028
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

332
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,323
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

333
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,993
I used to work at the Diplomat.

334
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,787
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

335
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,290
You must open it. Let's go.

336
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,918
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

337
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,754
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

338
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,675
- There are Tutsi spies everywhere.
- I cannot take all these people.

339
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,719
No, no, sir.
You do not have to.

340
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,555
We have our car and our van.

341
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,725
<i>- Captain Kaliso, come on.</i>
- Roger.

342
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,686
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry!

343
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,938
- Go around, go around.
- We found him.

344
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,356
Let's go. Let's go!

345
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,570
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

346
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,998
Oh, Jesus, no!

347
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,376
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

348
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,338
Don't look, don't look.

349
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,507
Don't look, Tatsi.

350
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,655
The safe is in the manager's office.

351
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,949
- You two, go with him.
- Yes, sir!

352
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,667
Look at this. Beer.

353
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,681
Hey!

354
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:48,022
I've got them.

355
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,782
Get down, all of you!

356
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,250
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

357
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,006
- No!
- Traitor!

358
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,884
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

359
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,595
Let me explain, sir. Please wait.

360
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,393
Shoot them.

361
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,232
Please, I don't use guns. I don't.

362
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,610
It's easy.

363
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,575
Shoot them, or you die first.

364
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:46,246
Sir, what could
I pay you not to do this?

365
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,584
- You wanna pay me?
- Why not? Look at them.

366
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,420
These are not rebels.

367
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,924
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

368
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,718
- How much?
- You name a price.

369
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,772
- Ten thousand francs for each.
- Sir, I don't have that much.

370
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,733
- OK.
- Wait, wait! Here.

371
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,278
It's 1,000 US. And here.

372
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,907
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

373
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,201
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

374
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,869
Go, go, go.

375
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,622
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

376
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,292
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

377
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,883
Sir, I have more money actually.

378
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,930
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

379
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,432
All right?

380
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,811
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

381
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,148
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

382
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,445
Here you are. See?

383
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,116
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

384
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,952
Sir...

385
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,166
I will give you
100,000 francs for all of them.

386
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,253
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

387
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,505
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

388
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,966
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the UN.

389
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:25,679
Sir, I swear, 100,000 francs.

390
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,349
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

391
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,146
Please, sir. Please.

392
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,983
- Let's go.
- OK. Everyone in the van.

393
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,027
Come on now. Hurry.

394
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,915
Go with my soldiers.

395
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,334
And hurry back if you
want to keep these cockroaches.

396
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,716
- The soldiers are here.
- Where is the car?

397
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,551
There is nothing I can do.

398
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,261
Excuse me, sir!
Please, could you...?

399
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,652
Here's the money.
100,000 francs as promised.

400
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,404
Now, please, let them go, sir.

401
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,241
Take the money.
We will get them later.

402
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,620
- You can go.
- Thank you.

403
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,749
Traitor.

404
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,004
Thank you, Paul.

405
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,388
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

406
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,599
- You must tell him when he comes...
- Here he is.

407
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:57,229
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

408
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,274
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

409
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,442
It's OK, It's OK...

410
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,944
Come on.

411
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,031
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

412
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,956
- Andre, we need two suites.
- Please, where is my...?

413
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,959
Yes, I understand.
I know, I understand. Please.

414
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,794
If you give me one moment, please.

415
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,840
Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.

416
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,427
What about our neighbors?
What will they do?

417
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,473
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

418
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,563
Please... put these guests
in two staff rooms.

419
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,981
Right away, sir.

420
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,201
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

421
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,833
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

422
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,669
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

423
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,597
This mess is unacceptable.
Call housekeeping,

424
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,876
get them up here right away.

425
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,716
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

426
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,762
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

427
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,725
Operator, I need a line.

428
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,895
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

429
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:29,154
- You did not reach them?
- No. No answer.

430
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,990
<i>It is a very tense situation,</i>

431
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,910
<i>and I just want to assure the families
of those who are there</i>

432
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,372
<i>that we are doing everything
we possibly can to ensure the safety</i>

433
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,875
<i>- of our citizens there.</i>
- Is the airport actually open?

434
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,878
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

435
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,381
We are trying to get as much information
for you as we can.

436
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:52,177
And yes, your passport, yes.
Antoinette will take care of this.

437
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,556
Dube, where is Gregoire?

438
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,145
Sir, he has moved into
the presidential suite.

439
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,869
Ah! Mr. Manager.

440
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,748
What do you think you are doing?

441
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,419
- Who is that?
- It's OK, darling.

442
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,464
- What do you want?
- You had better get out of this room,

443
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,759
- and back downstairs right away.
- I don't have to listen to you.

444
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,764
Yes, you do. I am in charge.
Now, get out of this room right now.

445
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,400
Mr. Manager, you notice the smell
of cockroaches?

446
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,238
If I were leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

447
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,616
And I know people who can cleanse it.

448
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,287
But maybe it doesn't bother you.

449
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,706
Why is that?

450
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,458
You're used to the smell.

451
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,544
Not me.

452
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,797
I need a clean room to escape it.

453
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,307
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

454
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,060
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

455
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,980
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor. But
we are operating at capacity as it is.

456
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,648
- I can give you one room.
- Paul!

457
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,776
But you will have to share it.
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:35,155
There's no way we can share.
There are eight of us.

459
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,991
- Yes? Yes, Madame Archer.
- I need your help.

460
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,835
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis Orphanage.

461
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,962
OK, come on, let's go.

462
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,465
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

463
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,511
Come.

464
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,514
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

465
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,810
Corporal, take that lady's bag,
please, and quickly.

466
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,357
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

467
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,318
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

468
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,116
Madame Archer,
I have a favor to ask of you.

469
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,284
My brother-in-law and his family,

470
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,955
they live near the St. Francis
on O'Clare, 20.

471
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,958
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

472
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,085
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

473
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,214
Please, keep moving!

474
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,302
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

475
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,889
- Please move into the hotel!
- Come on, don't be afraid.

476
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,101
- Around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving.

477
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,193
- Has he spoken to you yet?
- No.

478
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,750
Is your face still hurting?

479
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,170
It's all right.

480
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,387
The neighbors asked me to thank you
for your kindness.

481
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,309
I shouldn't have brought them here.

482
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,731
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

483
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,442
was to never lower
the tone of the hotel.

484
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,738
"Maintain the Mille Colline's dignity
at all times, Paul."

485
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,661
Soon, all of this will be over.

486
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,124
What if I lose my job?

487
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,463
- Oh, my God!
- Where are you going?

488
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,006
I'll be right back.

489
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,321
- Take care of them.
- How, sir?

490
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,991
Bathe them. Feed them.

491
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,827
Put them to bed.

492
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,666
I will send you some help.

493
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,964
OK, babies.

494
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,341
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

495
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,010
Will the UN intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

496
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,180
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

497
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,849
My orders are not to intervene.

498
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,311
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

499
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,646
Here. Over here.

500
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,774
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

501
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,151
We're not allowed to do that, Jack.

502
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,862
David, the shit's going down
outside these walls.

503
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,407
- We gotta cover it.
- We're not leaving the hotel grounds

504
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,867
unless we have an armored car.
That's the ground rules.

505
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,954
The ground rules? Where do you
think we are, fucking Wimbledon?

506
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:16,167
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

507
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,837
Shoot some B roll of the refugees.

508
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,385
- Can you move out the way?
- Let's go.

509
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,179
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

510
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,057
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

511
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,561
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

512
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,148
This is not a refugee camp.
Can you not take them with you

513
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,610
- to your facilities?
- No, I can't do that. I'm sorry.

514
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:48,658
I'm overwhelmed at my refugee camp.
I'm under attack, constant attack.

515
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,704
As soon as we can stabilize
the situation, then I'll take them.

516
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,253
<i>...Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.</i>

517
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,757
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge called Makesa...</i>

518
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,593
<i>...is hiding at 4...</i>

519
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:11,765
- <i>...Kabulla and his cockroaches...</i>
- Turn that radio off.

520
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,934
<i>Watch out for him. He...</i>

521
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,772
And get back to work.

522
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,523
We have a hotel to run.

523
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,777
There's no work here, anyway.
The boss has left.

524
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,528
I am your boss.

525
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,921
<i>Sir, there's a call from the
Mille Collines in Rwanda on line one.</i>

526
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,590
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

527
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,844
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

528
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,055
I met you on your
last visit here, Mr. Tillens.

529
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,726
Ah, yes, Paul, I remember.
How are things there?

530
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,187
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

531
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,567
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

532
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,736
until this unrest is over.

533
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,989
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?</i>

534
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:17,080
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

535
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,418
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

536
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,587
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

537
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,091
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

538
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,261
Very well, Paul. Very well.

539
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,265
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

540
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,685
If there is anything I can do,
please call.

541
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,981
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you, right away.

542
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,360
Let me tell you it was an
embarrassment to have to ask for this.

543
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,448
Most of us in this room have known
each other and worked together

544
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,283
for many years.

545
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:58,121
Is it really necessary for me
to get a letter from Belgium

546
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,706
for you to perform your duties?

547
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,963
In fact, forget this letter.

548
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,175
If you don't want to work for me,
and would rather be out there,

549
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,885
then leave now.

550
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,518
Please, everyone, back to work.

551
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,234
Paul, thank you for coming.

552
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,361
The air conditioner's on the blink.

553
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,905
Is there any way
you can have a look at it?

554
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,698
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

555
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:38,203
Fred, let me know when you get
the satellite feed. Thanks.

556
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,831
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

557
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,083
Thank you, Paul.

558
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,505
You're an oasis in the desert.

559
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,592
<i>...the elements of the government
and army are following the example</i>

560
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,928
<i>of what happened to
the Americans in Somalia.</i>

561
00:41:55,095 --> 00:42:00,266
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,
try to attack us, and...</i>

562
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,604
<i>...hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.</i>

563
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,105
<i>Do you think they'll succeed?</i>

564
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,566
<i>No, they won't. The UN's here to stay.</i>

565
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,276
<i>What about the outbreak of violence</i>

566
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,364
<i>since the shooting down
of the president's plane?</i>

567
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,697
What the hell do you think you're doing?

568
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,201
I'm responsible for
the safety of this crew.

569
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,247
What is this?

570
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,113
- Where'd you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

571
00:42:55,281 --> 00:43:00,451
Fred. It's David. I've got
incredible footage. It's a massacre.

572
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,288
Dead bodies, machetes.

573
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,332
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

574
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,543
Yeah.

575
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,550
You have to lead with this.

576
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,761
I point at you, you do a shot.

577
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,599
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking...

578
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,934
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

579
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,730
Listen, sorry about earlier.

580
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,482
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have...

581
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,152
I am glad that you
have shot this footage,

582
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,987
and that the world will see it.

583
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,616
It is the only way we have a chance
that people might intervene.

584
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:47,165
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

585
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,837
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

586
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:57,508
I think
if people see this footage,

587
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,803
they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible."

588
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,972
And then go on eating their dinners.

589
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,730
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna...

590
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,483
I have more work to do.
Thank you for your offer.

591
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,068
Please, enjoy your evening.

592
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,742
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

593
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,078
We've got trouble at the gate.

594
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,755
Here, get up, get up.

595
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:44,347
- They're killing everyone.
- To the hotel!

596
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,225
Come on!

597
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,359
Hold on! Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

598
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,972
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,142
You two,
take up positions behind...

600
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:33,980
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian UN soldiers.

601
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,816
They were protecting
the lady prime minster.

602
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,318
- She is dead.
- Yeah, she is dead.

603
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,031
The Europeans are putting
together an intervention force.

604
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,839
- They'll be here in a few days.
- Yes, I understand that, Colonel,

605
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,370
but there is simply no place
for me to put all of them.

606
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,415
What can I do?
I'll put two more men on the gate,

607
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,084
two of my best lieutenants.

608
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,502
- All right.
- All right.

609
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,504
I understand. Thank you.

610
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,185
Madame Archer. Hello.

611
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,937
We were expecting you five days ago.

612
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,105
I'm sorry.

613
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,649
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

614
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,319
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

615
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,155
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

616
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,159
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

617
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,497
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

618
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,500
OK. But...

619
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:40,588
My brother and his wife,
did the old lady know of them?

620
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:47,678
My brother is dead. They would
never leave their children.

621
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,682
Perhaps they could not make it home,
Tatiana. They are hiding.

622
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,853
Please, can you return and
bring the girls back here to us?

623
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,398
I can't. There are Interhamwe
roadblocks everywhere.

624
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,738
When I reached the orphanage...

625
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,783
...the Interhamwe were there.

626
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,370
They'd already started killing children.

627
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,330
They made me watch.

628
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:22,797
There was one girl, she had her
little sister wrapped on her back.

629
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,720
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me:

630
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,433
"Please don't let them kill me. I..."

631
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,854
"I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

632
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,815
Please, I can't.

633
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:52,326
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

634
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,796
I've nowhere to take the orphans, Paul.

635
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,675
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon,

636
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,596
and then we will
get the orphans out then.

637
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,445
They're here!

638
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,160
They're here! We are safe!

639
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,331
- Soldiers have arrived!
- Wow, look, it's the French!

640
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,459
- Yes!
- Thank goodness!

641
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,794
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

642
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,297
- Yes.
- Well done.

643
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,760
About time, gentlemen.

644
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,180
Thank you for saving our lives.

645
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,354
It's OK, Roger.

646
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,191
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

647
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,864
See, it's OK.

648
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,540
Sweetheart,
I told you we'd be safe.

649
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,460
See? I told you. Yeah.

650
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,591
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

651
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,428
- Something strong.
- Scotch?

652
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,846
Yeah.

653
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:43,729
Congratulations, Colonel.
You have performed a minor miracle.

654
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,609
- Congratulations?
- Yes, sir.

655
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,864
You should spit in my face.

656
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,453
- Excuse me, Colonel?
- You're dirt.

657
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,332
We think you're dirt, Paul.

658
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,293
Who is "we"?

659
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,798
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

660
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,884
They think you're dirt,
they think you're worthless.

661
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,429
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

662
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:21,726
Oh, come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.
You're the smartest man here.

663
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,730
You got them all
eating out of your hands.

664
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,817
You could own this freaking hotel,
except for one thing.

665
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,444
You're black.

666
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,989
You're not even a nigger.

667
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,575
You're an African.

668
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,458
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

669
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,587
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

670
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,550
- Please.
- Got it.

671
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,929
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

672
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,808
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

673
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,105
What is it?

674
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,237
All the whites are leaving.

675
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,158
They are being evacuated.

676
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,911
But... what about us?

677
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,580
We have been abandoned.

678
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,583
But the soldiers will stop the killers.

679
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,086
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

680
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,422
I said all the whites are leaving.
The French, the Italians,

681
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,383
even the UN Belgian soldiers.
All of them!

682
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,099
- Who is left?
- I don't know.

683
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:50,147
Colonel Oliver said he has 300 UN
peacekeepers for the whole country.

684
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,611
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

685
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,947
And they are not allowed to shoot.

686
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,374
- I am a fool.
- No. No, no.

687
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,211
They told me I
was one of them, and I...

688
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:19,343
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style...
I swallowed it.

689
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,096
I swallowed it. I swallowed all of it.

690
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,266
And they handed me their shit.

691
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:34,191
I have no history. I have no memory.

692
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,319
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

693
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,739
You are no fool.

694
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,662
I know who you are.

695
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,251
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

696
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,754
<i>A United Nations source reports that
the US and British representatives</i>

697
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,424
<i>on the Security Council
will lobby for the removal</i>

698
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,093
<i>of all UN peacekeepers from Rwanda.</i>

699
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,283
- Please don't go.
- Wait, he's British.

700
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,784
Pull out your passport.

701
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,495
Please don't...

702
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,917
Can we talk just one second?

703
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,962
Please don't. Please.
They'll put me on the street.

704
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,214
They'll chop me.

705
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,261
Just take... take this.

706
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,264
- No, no, no!
- Just take it. Take the money.

707
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,934
You must go.
Please, they are waiting.

708
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,644
- Paul?
- They are waiting.

709
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,188
Paul.

710
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,274
He won't put you out. Here.
Give her anything she needs.

711
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,318
- Anything, just...
- It's not necessary.

712
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,656
- That's it.
- We have to let him go.

713
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:16,168
Don't do that, please. I'm so ashamed.

714
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,932
Wait! Wait!

715
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,689
Hold the buses!

716
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,023
Peter!

717
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,373
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

718
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,500
- No Rwandans.
- What?

719
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,378
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

720
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,146
But you can't leave the children behind.

721
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,048
Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

722
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,633
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

723
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,552
Father, it is of no use.

724
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,722
These men are not here...
they are not here to help us.

725
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,432
Please, there is nothing we can do.

726
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,101
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

727
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,020
It is of no use, Father. Please, hurry.

728
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,526
No, no, no. No, no, no. No.

729
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,069
To the hotel. To the hotel.

730
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,740
No... no!

731
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,368
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

732
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:35,622
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel. Go inside.

733
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,168
Go inside the hotel, all of you.

734
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,212
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

735
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,591
Go into the hotel.

736
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,511
No!

737
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,391
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

738
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,484
Excuse me. Excuse me.

739
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,491
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

740
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,161
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

741
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,248
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

742
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,132
- Paul.
- Hmm?

743
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,177
I want you to go.

744
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,638
Go where?

745
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,520
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

746
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,689
- Your card says Hutu.
- What are you saying?

747
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,192
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

748
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,821
- I want you to go.
- No, Tatiana, no.

749
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,116
I will never leave you.

750
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,912
I will never leave you.

751
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,794
Oh, Tatsi.

752
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:54,887
Let us sleep, my wife. Let us sleep.

753
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,902
Get up. Get up.
Get up, get up, get up.

754
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,238
Are you the manager?

755
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,491
Yes, sir. What's the matter?

756
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,036
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

757
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,246
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

758
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,664
It's an order.

759
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:28,754
I need some time,
20, 30 minutes, to take a shower.

760
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,883
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

761
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,513
Please, let me get you some beers, eh?

762
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,807
You and your boys. And I'll
be down right away, all right?

763
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,268
- As quick as I can.
- Ten minutes.

764
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,312
Yes, sir, ten minutes.

765
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,399
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

766
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,778
Roger's not here. Where is he?
Where's Roger?

767
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,739
- Under the bed.
- Roger.

768
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,618
Shh! It's Papa. They've gone.

769
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,788
Come, come. Shh, shh...

770
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:10,504
Oh, my darling, it's OK.
Come on, it's OK.

771
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,090
Go to the roof, Tatiana.

772
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,093
- The roof?
- Yes, yes, go to the roof right now.

773
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,471
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

774
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,309
He is where?
No, that is unacceptable.

775
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,979
Who would order such a thing?

776
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,566
Yes, did you find the general?

777
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,321
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

778
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,240
Get me the guest list.

779
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,034
Yes, sir.

780
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,079
Yes?

781
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,707
<i>Sorry, sir, but I have
a call from Paul in Kigali.</i>

782
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,085
<i>- He says it's urgent.</i>
- Paul, are you all right?

783
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,838
<i>- We have a big problem, sir.</i>
- What?

784
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,008
The Hutu army have come.
They've ordered us,

785
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,511
- all of us, out of the hotel.
- Why are they doing this?

786
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,265
- I think they will kill us all.
- Kill?

787
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,353
What do you mean... all? How many?

788
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:13,358
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

789
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,360
- Eight hundred?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

790
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,405
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.</i>

791
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,325
I do not have much time left, sir.

792
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,997
I, um... I want to thank you

793
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,541
<i>for everything that you
have done for me and my family,</i>

794
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,628
<i>and please thank all
of my friends at Sabena.</i>

795
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,967
Paul, wait. I'm gonna
put you on hold. Stay by the phone.

796
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,888
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

797
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,224
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

798
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,978
Louis, get on to the UN.
Tell them what's happening.

799
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,266
Did you need something, sir?

800
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,817
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

801
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,152
OK.

802
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,909
- Paul, are you there?
- Yes, sir.

803
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,869
Who can I call to stop this?

804
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,916
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

805
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:16,546
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

806
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,886
What are you doing, Dube?

807
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,306
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

808
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,769
Go and get these boys some more beer.

809
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,730
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?
- Thank you.

810
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,694
Come with me, please.

811
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,075
- Sir, that was two weeks ago.
- Shh!

812
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,373
Here you are, sir.

813
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,628
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

814
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,965
What is this? Huh?

815
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,094
It is the guest list, sir.

816
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,139
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

817
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:12,310
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

818
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:16,440
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

819
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:21,319
Get me the names of all
the cockroaches in there now.

820
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,157
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

821
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:29,911
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

822
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,248
then I'll kill everyone in there.

823
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,418
Starting with you.

824
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,753
Leave.

825
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:44,009
Yes, sir.

826
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,304
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

827
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:57,147
- Yes, sir.
- Who did you call?

828
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,151
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

829
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:07,616
- What is your name?
- Rusesabagina.

830
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,368
Paul Rusesabagina.

831
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,871
I'll remember you.

832
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,209
I'll remember you. Let's go.

833
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,086
Hey, come on.
Come on, we're leaving.

834
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,847
They're gone.

835
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,190
I was afraid for you.

836
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,320
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

837
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,781
I must talk with this man.

838
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,123
- Mr. Tillens.
<i>- Paul, what's going on?</i>

839
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,418
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

840
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,630
I got through to the
French president's office.

841
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,218
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

842
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:13,598
I pleaded with the French and the
Belgians to go back and get you all.

843
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,435
<i>I am afraid this is not going to happen.</i>

844
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,107
They're cowards, Paul.

845
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:26,278
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

846
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,824
The French, the British, the Americans.

847
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,118
I am sorry, Paul.

848
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,079
Thank you.

849
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,460
There will be no rescue...

850
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,297
...no intervention force.

851
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,009
We can only save ourselves.

852
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,721
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

853
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,141
- You must call these people.
- Please, fax this...

854
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,645
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

855
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,189
Say goodbye.

856
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,654
But when you say goodbye,
say it as though you are

857
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:13,450
reaching through the phone
and holding their hand.

858
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,037
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

859
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,332
...you will die.

860
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:27,464
We must shame them into sending help.

861
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:34,763
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

862
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,934
The Interhamwe believe that the Mille
Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

863
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,187
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

864
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,856
Have you printed the bills?

865
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,526
Thank you. Now,
please erase the register.

866
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:49,694
Erase it?

867
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,364
Yes. I want no names to appear there.

868
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,407
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

869
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,243
Tell them to remove all
of the numbers from the doors.

870
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,621
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

871
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:10,006
Good day. Here is your bill
for the last week.

872
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,676
If you cannot pay or think
you will not be able to pay,

873
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,846
please go to the banquet room and Dube
will take care of you. Thank you.

874
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,560
<i>Does the
State Department have a view</i>

875
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,314
<i>as to whether or not what is
happening could be genocide?</i>

876
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,566
<i>We have every reason to believe</i>

877
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,235
<i>that acts of genocide have occurred.</i>

878
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:35,240
<i>How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?</i>

879
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,368
<i>That's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.</i>

880
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,913
<i>Is it true that
you have specific guidance</i>

881
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,541
<i>not to use the word
"genocide" in isolation,</i>

882
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,293
<i>but always to preface it
with this word "acts of?"</i>

883
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:53,717
<i>Um, I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.</i>

884
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:57,887
<i>I have... There are
formulations that we are using</i>

885
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,598
<i>that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of...</i>

886
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,603
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

887
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,440
As long as it is Scotch.

888
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,362
Your... your white friends
have abandoned you.

889
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,616
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

890
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,452
I will take care of you.

891
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,121
I'm glad to hear that
because I was wondering

892
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,248
if perhaps you could
spare us a few policemen.

893
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,959
- To protect us, sir.
- The police are very busy, Paul.

894
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,589
Yes, I'm aware of this. But when I
last spoke to the president of Sabena,

895
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:36,092
he assured me that anyone who
helped protect Belgian property

896
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,844
would be well rewarded.

897
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,138
I will see what I can do.

898
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,391
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

899
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,353
Where has all our beer gone?

900
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,981
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

901
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,442
How much beer?

902
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,360
Many.

903
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:00,575
...come down to the
reception. Then he says to me,

904
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,410
"How do you want the girls?"

905
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,748
There's our cockroach manager,
always kissing ass.

906
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,339
General...

907
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,009
I'm glad you came by.

908
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,762
I overheard something that
I think you should know about.

909
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,848
- What did you overhear?
- It was a discussion

910
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,434
between a UN colonel
and an American Embassy official.

911
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,562
- And what did they say?
- The American assured the colonel

912
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,440
- that they would watch everything.
- How? They have gone, Paul.

913
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,652
With their spies. Satellites.

914
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,948
Americans.

915
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,866
Oh, Gregoire!

916
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,081
You know, I admire you, General.

917
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,126
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

918
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,547
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

919
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,508
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

920
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,010
He won't work, listens to no one.

921
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,722
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

922
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,444
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

923
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:20,405
Satellites?

924
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:25,076
What was I going to say, that the
Americans were hiding in the trees?

925
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:40,884
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

926
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,929
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

927
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,808
- No. No, no.
- I have to, Tatiana.

928
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,769
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

929
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,521
You cannot go alone.

930
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,817
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

931
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,154
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

932
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:13,374
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

933
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,210
Please, sir,
accept my humblest apologies.

934
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:19,214
Please, please.
We have a job this morning.

935
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,925
We are going to see George Rutaganda.

936
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,302
Please get the van.

937
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,822
Show me your ID.

938
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,033
<i>Remember how those Tutsi women</i>

939
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:50,912
<i>would look down their
long noses at Hutu men?</i>

940
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,083
<i>- Now they beg for their lives.</i>
- I'm here to see George Rutaganda.

941
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,586
<i>I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.</i>

942
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,589
<i>Then they'll know what
Hutu power is, my warriors.</i>

943
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:05,718
<i>Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.</i>

944
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,096
<i>We need to exterminate these vermin.</i>

945
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,379
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

946
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,678
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

947
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,723
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

948
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,731
Paul, everything
is double the price now.

949
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:03,359
- You understand that?
- Yes. I need rice, beans,

950
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:08,448
powdered milk, beer
and your best whiskey.

951
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:11,993
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

952
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:16,164
- You have no whiskey?
- No whiskey, no spirits.

953
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,044
Your, uh... rich guests
will have to do without their Scotch.

954
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:25,089
Anyway, Paul, I have
bled that cow enough now.

955
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,759
What are you saying, George?

956
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,137
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,

957
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,182
their money is no good to them anymore.

958
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,684
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

959
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,482
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

960
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,193
And why not?

961
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,029
Why not?

962
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,948
We are halfway there already.

963
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,830
So, Paul, you want 12 bags of rice, eh?

964
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:00,666
Give him 12 bags of rice
and four crates of beer.

965
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,377
Yes, sir. Right away.

966
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:07,465
Oh, and Paul, I'll give you
a crate of soft drinks,

967
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,425
for the kids. Free of charge.

968
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,470
Thanks.

969
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:16,641
Um... Ten bags of beets. Come! Quick!

970
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,602
And put those in the van. You!

971
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,648
Let me give you a little tip, my friend.

972
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,336
Our generals in the army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines"

973
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,402
"or they will send the
Belgian soldiers back here."

974
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:32,782
But soon, those generals will have gone,
and we will be in charge.

975
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,329
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

976
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,466
Let's go.

977
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,555
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

978
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:58,307
You have some very important traitors
at that hotel.

979
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:02,353
Now, if we were to get them,
then maybe we will let you

980
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,689
have one or two cockroaches of your own.

981
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,317
Do you understand?

982
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,238
It is almost dawn, George.

983
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,616
We really must be going.

984
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,954
Take the river road back. It's clear.

985
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,434
Oy!

986
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,479
Oh! Gregoire. What is going on now?

987
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,397
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

988
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,817
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

989
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,260
Ah!

990
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,320
Back up the car, Gregoire.

991
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,282
Listen to me.

992
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,703
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

993
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,413
No one, Gregoire.

994
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,014
Oh, Dube.

995
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,225
Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

996
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,636
Oh, dear.

997
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,260
- Sir, are you OK?
- Don't come in!

998
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:07,181
Don't come in!
I'll be out in a minute!

999
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,894
- Sir, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

1000
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,939
Don't come in. I'll be out.

1001
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,474
Hundreds.

1002
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,687
It was too many to count.

1003
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,526
Why are people so cruel?

1004
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,449
Hatred.

1005
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,493
Insanity, I don't know.

1006
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,083
There you go.

1007
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,210
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1008
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,880
Oh, yes.

1009
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,716
...to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

1010
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,218
I remember...

1011
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:28,888
No, no, no, you make a mistake. Hello.

1012
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,514
Come with me.

1013
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,351
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

1014
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,161
It's beautiful.

1015
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,372
You like it?

1016
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:08,719
- I hear we must pay for everything.
- Yes, this is true.

1017
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:13,682
So... how much for this?

1018
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,144
A kiss.

1019
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:33,744
You are a good man, Paul Rusesabagina.

1020
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,346
I have a confession.

1021
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,268
- When you worked as the nurse...
- In Ruhengeri.

1022
01:20:57,435 --> 01:21:00,479
Yes. When we first met.

1023
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,650
I had you transferred to Kigali.

1024
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,320
What?

1025
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,615
I bribed the Minister of Health

1026
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:13,742
to have you transferred to Kigali.

1027
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,414
- Why?
- To be closer.

1028
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,417
So that I could marry you.

1029
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,425
What was the bribe?

1030
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,306
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

1031
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,267
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

1032
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,147
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1033
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,149
I want to know.

1034
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,320
- A Volkswagen.
- A Volk...?

1035
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:54,742
I hope it was a new one.

1036
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,978
We have had a good life, you and I, yes?

1037
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:30,527
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

1038
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,371
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

1039
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,042
Our children cannot see us die first.

1040
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,712
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

1041
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,674
- I don't want to...
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

1042
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,510
- I don't want you to talk like that.
- We have to, Tatiana.

1043
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:01,558
If I do not make it, you must
take all of our children by the hand.

1044
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,770
You must jump.

1045
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,067
- What are you saying?
- You have to, Tatiana.

1046
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,903
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

1047
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,365
The machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

1048
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,994
- I couldn't...
- You have to promise me, Tatiana.

1049
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,579
Please. Promise me you will do it.

1050
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,043
Please, Tatiana.

1051
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,840
Please.

1052
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,302
I'm sorry. I love you.

1053
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,639
I love you.

1054
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:50,232
I'm gonna get you!

1055
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,110
Diane, Elys, you know better.

1056
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,529
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

1057
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,282
- Take these children in the back.
- Sorry, Papa.

1058
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,757
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

1059
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:07,124
Paul, I've got good news.

1060
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:13,589
Congratulations, your calls have worked.

1061
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:17,426
I have exit visas
for the following families.

1062
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:20,846
Abukesu, Tanzania.

1063
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:24,058
Bidori, Kenya.

1064
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,646
- Gituaranga, Zambia.
- Hallelujah!

1065
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,983
- Khalesa, Belgium.
- Oh, thank you!

1066
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,652
Dakuzi...

1067
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,822
...Kenya.

1068
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:42,034
Masambo, Zambia.

1069
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,955
Zinguru, Ghana.
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

1070
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,126
All right, that's it.

1071
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:56,632
So remember,
families be ready at 7am. Let's go.

1072
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,008
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

1073
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,261
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

1074
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,973
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

1075
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:08,685
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

1076
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,062
Excuse me.

1077
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:15,317
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

1078
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,568
Yeah.

1079
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,156
The girls...
Paul, I will not leave without them.

1080
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,501
What have you brought us?

1081
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,838
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

1082
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,339
Thank you.

1083
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,716
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

1084
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,176
Are you on the list?

1085
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:50,018
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

1086
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:54,273
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1087
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,358
and bring the girls back here to us?

1088
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:00,279
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

1089
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:02,698
They're probably dead.

1090
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:09,621
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

1091
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,126
I'll try.

1092
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,671
We have to leave by 7am.

1093
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,174
Who'll take care of
the orphans when you're gone?

1094
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:24,011
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

1095
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:32,102
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

1096
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,689
I will find someone. I promise you.

1097
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,652
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1098
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,578
Come on, take my hand.

1099
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:53,123
<i>News Service Africa.
Today a Red Cross representative</i>

1100
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,751
<i>claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict</i>

1101
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:59,421
<i>may have climbed to as many
as 500,000 victims.</i>

1102
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:04,343
<i>One report stated that 40,000 bodies
had been removed from Lake Victoria.</i>

1103
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:07,137
Where is she?

1104
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:10,766
I don't know. We wait until seven.

1105
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,810
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

1106
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:16,355
...she may not be coming.

1107
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,067
Thank you.

1108
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,319
Please, take these letters.

1109
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,446
Yes, I will take your letters.

1110
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,282
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

1111
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,620
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

1112
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:32,955
Thank you very much.

1113
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:36,541
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

1114
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,963
God be with you.

1115
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,673
Yes, do you have any children?

1116
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,175
Yes, you're clear to go.

1117
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:50,347
- No, sorry, no good.
- Come. Come, children.

1118
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,433
Tatsi, come.

1119
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,395
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

1120
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:58,397
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

1121
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:01,358
- There you go.
- Let's move out!

1122
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,030
Good luck, sir.

1123
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,711
I am not leaving.
You hold Tatiana.

1124
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:23,839
Take care of my family.

1125
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,178
Paul. Paul!

1126
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,181
I cannot leave these people to die.

1127
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,226
- I cannot leave these people.
- Papa!

1128
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:39,313
Roger! Roger,
I will follow on the next flight.

1129
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,149
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1130
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,694
Don't worry. Don't worry,
children. Your father's going to be OK.

1131
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,905
Papa! Don't worry. He's OK.

1132
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:52,200
- I want Papa!
- It's OK.

1133
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:21,104
<i>I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches</i>

1134
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:23,357
<i>are the same as cockroaches.</i>

1135
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,444
<i>- They are all the same.</i>
- This is crazy.

1136
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:31,656
<i>Their fate should be the same.</i>

1137
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,797
<i>The Tutsi cockroaches of
the rebel army must be denied recruits.</i>

1138
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:50,133
<i>Come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.</i>

1139
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:53,637
Goddamn radio station.

1140
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:57,849
OK. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

1141
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:02,813
<i>Stand by your radios.</i>

1142
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,440
<i>I am hearing some urgent news.</i>

1143
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:09,152
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

1144
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,697
It is important!
It is on the radio. You have to hear it.

1145
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,327
<i>We have received reports
of very important cockroaches</i>

1146
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:20,997
<i>and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille Collines Hotel.</i>

1147
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:22,666
<i>Gather up your weapons.</i>

1148
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,669
<i>Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.</i>

1149
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:29,172
<i>- They are being smuggled away...</i>
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?

1150
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,676
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

1151
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,813
Please, sir, I will
give you whatever I have.

1152
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,482
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

1153
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,696
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush!

1154
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,468
Slow down.

1155
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:17,596
Stay calm.

1156
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,307
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

1157
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,311
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

1158
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,147
No, no. I've got
UN personnel in these trucks.

1159
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,483
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

1160
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,986
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this.

1161
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,156
- I am.
- Cover me.

1162
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,831
Go to the back.

1163
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,925
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

1164
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,520
Get back! You're not
to hurt these people.

1165
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:10,232
Get back! Move back!

1166
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:12,692
Look, I told you, you've got
cockroaches in your truck.

1167
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,530
No, no, no. They're political
refugees under UN sanction.

1168
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:24,079
<i>News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army</i>

1169
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,540
<i>who will not let us punish them.</i>

1170
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,597
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

1171
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:37,133
No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

1172
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:40,428
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

1173
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,264
Stop him!

1174
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:43,431
Ah!

1175
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:52,941
What's your name?

1176
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,277
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

1177
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:56,987
Kill them!

1178
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,072
Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1179
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,950
What's your name?
What's your name?

1180
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:05,745
Let's move! Drive! Move! Get out!

1181
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,664
Out, or I'll shoot!

1182
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,084
Get out!

1183
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,007
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1184
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,843
Help us get out of here.

1185
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,636
Clear the street!

1186
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,773
<i>I am receiving
more news, good Hutus.</i>

1187
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:37,652
<i>I have learned that the traitor
Rusesabagina's cockroaches</i>

1188
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:41,698
<i>are on a truck.
10,000 francs for their heads!</i>

1189
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:46,661
Stay still. Give me your shirt, quickly.

1190
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,173
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

1191
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,343
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

1192
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,765
- Please, please.
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!

1193
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:09,809
- You need to hurry up, please.
- Come, hurry, hurry!

1194
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,482
- Let me help you.
- Someone give the guard a hand, please.

1195
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,694
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

1196
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:24,658
I was so worried about you.

1197
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:29,120
- Get him inside!
- Tatiana. Tatiana.

1198
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,415
You left me. You left me.

1199
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,918
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1200
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,879
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

1201
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,923
Shh! Shh! Shh...

1202
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,802
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

1203
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:47,055
- Papa, Mama! Mama...
- I love you.

1204
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,608
I wanted you to be safe. All of you.

1205
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:02,112
That was not your decision to make.

1206
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:04,364
We make our decisions together.

1207
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,492
- That was our promise.
- You are right.

1208
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,619
You are right.

1209
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,455
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

1210
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:15,291
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, some more water.

1211
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:17,919
What are they doing?

1212
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:21,131
- Dube.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1213
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:23,967
They shot down the water.
This is all we have.

1214
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,727
- General.
- Where are my supplies?

1215
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,479
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

1216
01:35:36,647 --> 01:35:41,484
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1217
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:44,012
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1218
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:49,200
- Sir, I have money from the guests.
- Rwandan francs!

1219
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:51,619
Those are only good for wiping your ass.

1220
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,248
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

1221
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:59,085
No more police, no more protection.

1222
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:02,213
Let the UN take care of you.

1223
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:08,052
Drive. Go!

1224
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,727
What would Sabena make of all this?

1225
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,611
Watch out!

1226
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:33,244
Get down, get down!

1227
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,042
Are you hurt? Hurt?

1228
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,377
Stay still, there's glass here.

1229
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:45,381
- Is anyone hurt here?
- Lots of cuts and bruises.

1230
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:54,224
Thank God it was a storeroom.

1231
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,645
<i>And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report</i>

1232
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,147
<i>that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army</i>

1233
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:05,193
<i>has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.</i>

1234
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,195
<i>One aid worker described it</i>

1235
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:10,532
<i>as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.</i>

1236
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:14,077
The rebels have taken half the city,
and they have proposed a deal

1237
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,538
the Hutu generals
are willing to accept.

1238
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:20,500
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

1239
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,335
and you people, all of you,

1240
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:25,839
will be able to move behind
the rebel lines where it's safe.

1241
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:29,384
- The Interhamwe, what about them?
- No one controls them.

1242
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,386
This time, they will kill us all.

1243
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:36,474
They will kill us all if we stay here.
We have to take the chance.

1244
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,102
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1245
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,230
I can put it together in two days, Paul.

1246
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,524
Two days?

1247
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,193
Colonel, there is no way that
we can hold out for two days.

1248
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,070
I have nothing left to bribe them with.

1249
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:54,158
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

1250
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:24,105
Diane. Shh... Let your mother rest.
You rest, too, sweetheart. Go to sleep.

1251
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,490
Diplomat.

1252
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,911
What?

1253
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,163
I have to go to the Diplomat.

1254
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,926
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

1255
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:56,387
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

1256
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,682
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1257
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,518
No. Let us see what
you have to offer first.

1258
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:16,699
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

1259
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,343
Move, move!

1260
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,557
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:42,892
Hurry!

1262
01:39:45,604 --> 01:39:48,731
Come on, show me.

1263
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,952
Look at this. Nice, yes?

1264
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,829
And here you are.

1265
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:11,838
The rebels are getting closer, yes?

1266
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:15,425
The rebels can have this graveyard.

1267
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:18,094
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

1268
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,723
Here.

1269
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:24,434
Have a drink.

1270
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:34,569
- You know what the Scottish call it?
- No.

1271
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,741
Uisge beatha. Water of life.

1272
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:49,459
I went once on a tour of the finest

1273
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:51,794
single malt distillery in the world.

1274
01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:55,298
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

1275
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,885
Wonderful country.

1276
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,470
Wonderful golf.

1277
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:04,766
I wonder... will I ever go back?

1278
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:07,769
What do you think?

1279
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:10,980
No.

1280
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:14,817
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

1281
01:41:16,528 --> 01:41:17,987
Can we go now, please, sir?

1282
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:22,366
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

1283
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:24,494
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

1284
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:27,538
Pack those carefully,
put them in my Jeep and guard them.

1285
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,877
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

1286
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:38,257
- I do not want to go to Gitarama, sir.
- Well, you can't go back to the hotel.

1287
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:40,426
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

1288
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:45,890
Sir... General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

1289
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:49,060
Trust me, we are better off here.

1290
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:53,940
General, these are difficult times.

1291
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:55,942
We need to help one another.

1292
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,278
And what help can I get from you, Paul?

1293
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,824
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

1294
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,702
You are on a list. The Americans have
you on their list as a war criminal.

1295
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,747
Paul, I am sick and tired of your lies.

1296
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:14,752
Are you stupid, General?
How do you think these people operate?

1297
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,421
You sit here
with five stars on your chest.

1298
01:42:17,589 --> 01:42:19,549
Who do you think
they are coming after?

1299
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:25,096
Fine.

1300
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:30,476
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

1301
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:34,188
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

1302
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:37,358
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

1303
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,193
They blame you
for all their misfortunes.

1304
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:42,321
- They say you led the massacres.
- I led no massacres!

1305
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:44,323
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1306
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:45,950
You will tell them the truth!

1307
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,369
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

1308
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,789
What are you going to do, shoot me?

1309
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:58,504
Shoot me. Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

1310
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:02,133
I will pay you to shoot my family.

1311
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,343
You cannot hurt me.

1312
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:07,263
You will tell them that I did nothing!

1313
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,769
We are leaving. Right now.

1314
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,449
Get out!

1315
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,910
Get these people away from the gate!

1316
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,459
Stop it! Stop it!

1317
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:39,462
Clear the hotel.

1318
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,631
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

1319
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:43,841
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

1320
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:45,343
Get out!

1321
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:49,889
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1322
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,037
Oh, no, no!

1323
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:19,794
That's him, that's him!

1324
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:26,384
I've got him! Help, I've got him!

1325
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,012
Stop this!

1326
01:44:36,853 --> 01:44:38,521
Stand where you are!

1327
01:44:55,872 --> 01:45:00,543
Tatiana!

1328
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,755
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

1329
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,387
- Paul, what is happening?
- No, no, I have to find my wife!

1330
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:20,271
Tatiana!

1331
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,549
They've gone. They've gone.

1332
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,719
They've gone.

1333
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,642
What were you going to do with this?

1334
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:12,114
I thought you had...

1335
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:27,922
Everyone, on the trucks!
Please! Thank you!

1336
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,340
Families, please stay together.

1337
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:32,301
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can.

1338
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:34,845
There's enough room for everyone.

1339
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:42,937
- I hope someday we will come back.
- Let's move out.

1340
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:57,326
- What is wrong with her?
- She has a very high fever.

1341
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:07,169
Where are we going, Daddy?

1342
01:47:08,004 --> 01:47:09,839
Someplace safe.

1343
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,397
My God.

1344
01:48:30,712 --> 01:48:32,671
What's happening?

1345
01:48:57,155 --> 01:49:00,324
Come on, let's go. Children on the
ground. Bring the children this way.

1346
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:02,701
Pass them back, pass them back.

1347
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:11,919
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

1348
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:25,808
Get down!

1349
01:49:28,478 --> 01:49:29,645
Stay down!

1350
01:49:53,044 --> 01:49:54,670
What's happening there?

1351
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:01,552
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

1352
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,014
It's OK. We're safe.

1353
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:06,682
It's OK.

1354
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,559
It's OK, you are safe here.
You are safe.

1355
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:11,729
It's OK now. Sit back down.

1356
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:15,399
Hello.

1357
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:47,973
Get some more water.

1358
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:51,977
The doctor says he is very dehydrated.

1359
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:54,772
We made it. Come on, let's get down.

1360
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,107
- Come on.
- It is OK.

1361
01:50:57,275 --> 01:50:59,568
- She is sick.
- OK.

1362
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:02,237
Yeah, she's very sick. Take her.

1363
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:08,702
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

1364
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,038
They'll take you to Tanzania.

1365
01:51:11,206 --> 01:51:15,042
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

1366
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:16,543
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1367
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:18,462
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1368
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:23,926
- Thank God.
- We made it.

1369
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,260
Please, please.

1370
01:51:25,428 --> 01:51:26,512
We are here, yeah?

1371
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,263
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

1372
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:30,599
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

1373
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:33,102
Mr. Manager.
I just want to thank you.

1374
01:51:33,269 --> 01:51:35,270
- Of course, Steven.
- Constance!

1375
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:38,899
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

1376
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:41,568
Have you seen my brother and his wife?

1377
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:45,698
- None of them.
- Has anyone seen these people?

1378
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:48,158
Mama, come see, quick.

1379
01:51:49,452 --> 01:51:52,162
Can you see them anywhere?

1380
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:56,250
- Here, Mama, look.
- Please...

1381
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,460
Do you see them, Mama?

1382
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:02,756
Is that them? Is that them, Mama?

1383
01:52:04,759 --> 01:52:06,635
Do you recognize these people?

1384
01:52:06,803 --> 01:52:10,347
- This little girl, her name is...
- No.

1385
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:11,640
Do you recognize her?

1386
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:17,020
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

1387
01:52:17,188 --> 01:52:19,481
Have any of you seen these girls?

1388
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,152
Anais. And that's my brother.

1389
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:27,573
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1390
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,251
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1391
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:42,004
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

1392
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:45,424
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- OK.

1393
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:50,763
Boussey?

1394
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,181
It's you.

1395
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:56,769
Where'd you find this child?

1396
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:59,730
They just arrived on trucks
from the Mille Collines.

1397
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:05,444
<i>All Mille Collines evacuees
to the buses now!</i>

1398
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:07,070
Oh, no.

1399
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:18,707
Wait!

1400
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:30,302
Hold it, please!

1401
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:34,181
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

1402
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:37,100
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

1403
01:53:37,268 --> 01:53:39,728
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

1404
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:41,104
Come. Come, come.

1405
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:43,398
Please, wait for us.

1406
01:53:43,566 --> 01:53:46,443
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought...

1407
01:53:47,737 --> 01:53:51,198
- It's wonderful to see you.
- Come quickly.

1408
01:53:58,873 --> 01:54:01,041
Carine? Anais?

1409
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:02,334
Anais?

1410
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:05,254
Just wait.
It's gonna be just a minute now.

1411
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:09,466
Anais? Carine?

1412
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:26,149
Oh, my God!

1413
01:54:26,317 --> 01:54:29,486
Oh, my God!

1414
01:54:29,654 --> 01:54:31,280
Come, come, come!

1415
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:38,453
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

1416
01:54:41,165 --> 01:54:42,958
Do you see your cousins?

1417
01:54:50,758 --> 01:54:53,093
They said there wasn't any room.

1418
01:54:53,261 --> 01:54:55,012
There's always room.
