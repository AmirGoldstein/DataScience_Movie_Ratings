Ain't gonna bite you.

Two-five-two actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming them up back there. Over.

You are one simple

I'm sorry, Sergeant.

42
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,203

You got some fucking red ants.

hit 15 klicks north of here.

115

Charlie had claymores
strung up in the trees.

116
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,122
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.
Bad shit.

117
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,342
Yeah, I got two
lieutenants and a captain.

119
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,177
All right, Sergeant, who
do you want on ambush?

120
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,013
Elias, you take your squad out.

121
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,558
Warren, you stay in,

122
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,397

Junior from your squad.

123
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,516

124
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,813

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

127

Fu Sheng's going on
an R&R tomorrow,

128
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,658

them out on an ambush?

They don't know shit, Barnes,

131
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,334

gonna run into something.

132
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,417
Think about it.

133
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,582
That's just great, Bob,
and what do you want me to do?

134
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,000
Send one of my guys
out to get zapped

135
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,876
so some lame-ass just in from the
world can get his beauty sleep? No.

136
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,924
Hey, O'Neill, take a break.

137
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,719
You don't have to be a prick every
day of your life, you know.

138
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,717
Elias, get your men ready.

139

140
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,266
O'Neill, your short-timers
stay in, but you go out.

141
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,230
I need veterans out there.

142
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,191
Sergeant Barnes.

143
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,565
Sergeant.

144
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,664
I think, in front of the men, it's
necessary for me to give the orders.

145
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,748
Yes, sir.

146
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,045
Shit, looks like
it's gonna rain.

147
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,927
Man, it's gonna piss
on us all night.

148
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,759
Gonna put a serious case of crotch rot
on that your ugly face of yours, Junior.

149
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,643
Goddamn, man. You break
your ass for the white man.

150
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,015
No justice, right?

151
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,940
What's O'Neill got, a nose up
the lieutenant's ass already?

152
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,188
How come we always
get fucking ambush?

153
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,690
'Cause it's politics,
man, politics.

154
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,449
Hey, Chris, did I show you
a picture of Lucy Jean?

155
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,788
No, you didn't.

156
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,658
She's the one for me, all
right, that Lucy Jean.

157
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,953
- And she's waiting for me, too.
- Yeah, she's real pretty.

158
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,579
You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

159
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,082
- Hey, you got a picture of your girl?
- No.

160
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,003
I guess that leaves some unlucky
girl back at home, don't it?

161
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,383
Tuck this in.

162
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,973
Shitcan this.

163
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,803
Don't need this. Turn around.

164
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,436
Come on.

165
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,358
Tex, you got Junior and
Taylor here on your position.

166
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,231
God damn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig.

167
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,449
I ain't getting greased
on this bush tonight,

168
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,160
so you keep this sorry
cheese-dick off my ass.

169
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,529
You got Taylor.

170
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,405
Gardner, you're with me.

171
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,416
Look, case anything happens to
you, you get lost or separated,

172
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,834
- Don't yell out, okay?
- Okay.

173
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,833
- Just sit tight, and we'll get to you.
- All right.

174
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,339
Yo! Saddle up!

175
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,553
Lock and load!

176
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,438
<i>Of course, Mom and Dad
didn't want me to come here.</i>

177
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,232
<i>They wanted me to
be just like them,</i>

178
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:51,107
<i>respectable, hard-working,
a little house, a family.</i>

179
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,694
<i>They drove me crazy with their
goddamn world, Grandma.</i>

180
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,115
<i>You know Mom.</i>

181
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,333
<i>I guess, I mean, I've always
been sheltered and special.</i>

182
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,123
<i>I just want to be anonymous,
like everybody else.</i>

183
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,254
<i>Do my share for my country.</i>

184
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,126
<i>Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.</i>

185
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,966
<i>Well, here I am,
anonymous, all right.</i>

186
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,259
<i>With guys nobody
really cares about.</i>

187
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,675
<i>They come from the end of
the line, most of them,</i>

188
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,803
<i>small towns you never heard of.</i>

189
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,772
<i>Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.</i>

190
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,979
<i>Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.</i>

191
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,482
<i>Two years high
school's about it.</i>

192
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,823
<i>Maybe if they're lucky, a job
waiting for them back in a factory</i>

193
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,532
<i>But most of them got nothing.</i>

194
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,868
<i>They're poor. They're
the unwanted.</i>

195
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,205
<i>Yet they're fighting for our
society and our freedom.</i>

196
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,460
<i>It's weird, isn't it? They're the
bottom of the barrel, and they know it.</i>

197
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,045
<i>Maybe that's why they
call themselves grunts,</i>

198
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,086
<i>'cause a grunt can take
it, can take anything.</i>

199
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,086
<i>They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma.
The heart and soul.</i>

200
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,053
Hey, Taylor.

201
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,847
Hey, cheese-dick, you're up.

202
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,679
- What?
- You're up.

203
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,935
You sure you know how to
work the claymores, dude?

204
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,106
Yeah. I'm sure.

205
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,196
Flick the safety off and bang
on that sucker three times.

206
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,031
Three times. I got it.

207
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,497
And don't catch any "Z"s on me,
buddy, or I'll sling your sorry ass.

208
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,374
- You hear me?
- Okay.

209
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,847
<i>Maybe I finally found
it, way down here in the mud.</i>

210
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,971
<i>Maybe from down here I
can start up again.</i>

211
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,187
<i>Be something I can be proud
of without having to fake it,</i>

212
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,976
<i>be a fake human being.</i>

213
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,853
<i>Maybe I can see something I don't yet see
or learn something I don't yet know.</i>

214
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,358
<i>I miss you.</i>

215
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,236
<i>I miss you very much.</i>

216
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,696
<i>Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.</i>

217
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,174
Junior.

218
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,598
Junior.

219
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,970
Hey.

220
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,561
All right, motherfucker!

221
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,146
It's your shift, man!

222
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,849
Okay?

223
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,064
Here, take this.

224
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,190
Blow the fucking claymorel

225
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,149
Take the safety off! Goddamn it.

226
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,029
- Drop it!
- Take the safety off, boy!

227
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,705
Feed me, Junior! Get
over here and feed me!

228
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,367
<i>Bravo
Two, Bravo Two, we...</i>

229
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,846
My fucking arm! My fucking arm!

230
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,569
- Jesus fucking Christ! My arm!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

231
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,107
I'm getting you medicine.

232
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,448
Doc, over here.
Gardner's hit!

233
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,788
- Be right there!
- Oh, shit.

234
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,290
I'm hit!

235
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,492
- Doc, he's hit, too.
- Taylor's hit!

236
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,119
- Taylor's hit!
- Oh, shit.

237
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,165
Doc.

238
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,547
How bad is it, Doc?

239
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,507
That dumb fuck didn't
blow his claymorel

240
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,718
Just relax,
man, it's a scratch.

241
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,211
Hold this on here.

242
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,009
Don't lie to me, Doc!
How bad is it?

243
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,258
He let them walk right up on us. He
was sleeping on his goddamn shift!

244
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,135
No, I did not.

245
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,809
Big Harold, you keep an eye on him.
You don't let him go into shock.

246
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,314
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!
Take the pain!

247
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,665
<i>Redleg, Redleg, Bravo Six.
I have NDPs at this time. Over.</i>

248
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,639
Hey, little guy,
you're gonna be okay.

249
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,054
Okay? Don't worry.

250
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,511
Big Harold.

251
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,936
Do you know if... If
you're gonna die?

252
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,562
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

253
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,157
Don't give me that morbid bullshit.
We're about to get out of here.

254
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,073
They gonna give you
three hot meals a day,

255
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,991
white sheets.

256
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,452
Them pretty white nurses,

257
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,701
they gonna give you blowjobs
if you pay them enough.

258
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,543
I heard all about
them white bitches.

259
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,037
Don't baby-talk him, man!

260
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,883
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them
walk right up on us and he don't do shit!

261
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,839
Just shut up, Junior.

262
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,800
You relax, okay, man?

263
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,339
Okay.

264
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,512
It's not so bad,

265
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,061
dying.

266
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,564
How long is...

267
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,359
How long is...

268
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,577
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there! You're gonna make it!

269
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,045
Come on, Gardner, hang in there!
You're gonna make it.

270
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,206
Come on! Don't quit!

271
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,469
Come on, Gardner! Help me!
Don't give up!

272
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,872
Y'all take a good look
at this lump of shit.

273
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,467
Remember what it looks like.

274
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,420
You fuck up in a firefight

275
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,595
and I goddamn guarantee you
a trip out of the bush

276
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,850
in a body bag!

277
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,971
Out here, assholes, you keep your
shit wired tight at all times!

278
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,311
And that goes for
you, shit-for-brains.

279
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,947
You don't sleep on
no fucking ambush!

280
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,572
And the next son of a bitch I
catch copping "Z"s in the bush,

281
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,871
I'm personally gonna take an
interest in seeing him suffer.

282
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,123
I shit you not.

283
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,211
Doc, tag him and bag him.

284
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,344
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

285
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,509
- It was Junior.
- Shut your face, chicken shit.

286
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,303
You in big trouble, boy.

287
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,639
Excuses are like
assholes, Taylor,

288
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,645
everybody got one.

289
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,179
Knock it off!

290
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,108
We got two men need
attention here.

291
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,188
Police up your extra
ammo and frags.

292
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,949
Don't leave nothing
for the dinks.

293
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,610
Junior,

294
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,865
Tony,

295
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,163
carry Gardner.

296
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,583
The man would be alive if he had a
few more days to learn something.

297
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,649
Hey, Taylor.
What's in the breeze?

298
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,866
- Okay, got light duty. Three days' worth.
- No shit!

299
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,455
- Yeah.
- Well, too bad we in base camp anyway.

300
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,869
- What you got, beers?
- Yeah.

301
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,663
Just stole me some
from the Top's supply.

302
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,916
Shit, he been stealing
it from us anyway.

303
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,040
Hey, Taylor! What, are you back?

304
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,375
Yeah, it looks like it.

305
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,424
Hey, King, where'd you
get those beers, boy?

306
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,592
- I found it.
- Oh, you found it.

307
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,261
You going on report, son, now.

308
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,102
Yeah, both of you come with me.
I got a little job for you.

309
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:33,730
<i>Good
morning, Vietnam.</i>

310
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,560
Motherfucker!

311
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,063
<i>This is the bright
sound in the a.m.</i>

312
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,606
Motherfucker!

313
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,535
I'm too short for
this shit, man.

314
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,574
They always fucking with us!
No letup.

315
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,790
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

316
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,878
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far
up Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.

317
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:04,264
Thirty-nine and a wake-up, a pause for
the cause, and I'm a gone motherfucker!

318
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,509
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

319
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,636
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit.

320
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,262
Ninety-two left to go.

321
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:15,893
April 17, heroes, man.
Home to California.

322
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,738
I'll be sitting outside, checking
out the babes on the beach.

323
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,982
The surfing's gonna be good.

324
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,784
March, man, in Tennessee.
Sniff the pines.

325
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,497
Sniff that cross-mounted
pussy down by the river.

326
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,741
Hot damn!

327
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,663
Hey, Taylor, how
long you got left?

328
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,464
- Three hundred and what?
- Thirty-two.

329
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,919
Three hundred and
thirty-two days.

330
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,217
<i>Xin loi, my boy!</i>

331
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,592
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man.

332
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,102
You gotta, like, count
backwards or something.

333
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,811
You know, like, you
got 40 days in.

334
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,602
I mean, think positive, dude.

335
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,151
Hey, Taylor. How in the
fuck you get here anyway?

336
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,439
- Why, you look educated.
- I volunteered for it.

337
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,906
You did what?

338
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,196
I volunteered. I dropped
out of college,

339
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:10,072
and told them I wanted the
infantry, combat, and Vietnam.

340
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,540
You volunteered
for this shit, man?

341
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,993
You believe that?

342
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,129
You's a crazy fucker,
giving up college.

343
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,133
It didn't make much sense. I
wasn't learning anything.

344
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,252
I figured why should just
the poor kids go off to war

345
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,346
and the rich kids always
get away with it?

346
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,307
Oh, I see. What we got
here is a crusader.

347
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,892
Sounds like it.

348
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,931
Shit.

349
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,856
You gotta be rich in the first
place to think like that.

350
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,434
Everybody know

351
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,272
the poor always being
fucked over by the rich.

352
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,525
Always have, always will.

353
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,867
I tell you what, if you be cool, I
introduce you around to some of the heads.

354
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,500
What are the heads?

355
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,210
Later, man.

356
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,379
What's up, brother?

357
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,010
Your highness has arrived.

358
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,137
Hey, what's happening?

359
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,015
Man, I thought you
was hanging 10 in Cambodia.

360
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,604
Come on, man.

361
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,521
How's it going?

362
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,451
What you doing in the
underworld, Taylor?

363
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,820
Well, this here ain't Taylor.

364
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,164
Taylor been shot. This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

365
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,795
You lame, Taylor?

366
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,385
- Am I what?
- Are you lame or something?

367
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,511
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

368
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,902
Give it here.

369
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,401
This shit's in the wind, troop.

370
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,486
Hey, man, what's happening, brother?
Why you...

371
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,909
You're gonna do that pot,
you better do it right.

372
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,121
You're weird, man.

373
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,838
You're a child, Lerner. Rhah
don't waste time on you.

374
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,052
- First time?
- Yeah.

375
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,978
Then the worm has definitely
turned for you, man.

376
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,647
Feel good?

377
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,070
Yeah, it feels good.

378
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,489
I got no pain in my neck now.

379
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,825
Feeling good, it's good enough.

380
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,746
Put your mouth on this.

381
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,612
Man, where the hell
is everybody, man?

382
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,522
They're getting
high, that's what.

383
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,867
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special, man.

384
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,867
Listen to that.
That's a bad jam.

385
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,957
Redneck noise, dude.
That's all it is.

386
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,372
Make about as much
sense as you do.

387
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,172
All them chucks be rapping
about how they losing they ho,

388
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,713
saying how they ain't
got no bread for beer.

389
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,672
Fuck that honky shit. Ought to
give me some Motown jams, dig it?

390
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,514
Man, what are you
talking shit for, man?

391
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,013
- Hey, Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude.

392
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,141
You see, y'all be trying
to keep the black man down

393
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,938
and string him out on that shit.

394
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,654
But the time be coming, my man, when
the black man throw that yoke off.

395
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,694
Simple. Free your mind,
your ass will follow.

396
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,404
Yeah, I can dig it, man.

397
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,496
You smoke that shit, everything kind
of gets weird. You know what I mean?

398
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,367
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass,

399
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,993
so we don't fight, so
we become pacifists?

400
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,630
Hey, but don't you worry, Bunny,
'cause you's a killer anyway, man.

401
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,250
Yeah, but I still like a piece
of pussy once in a while.

402
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,594
Ain't nothing like a piece of
pussy except maybe the Indy 500.

403
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,806
Only way you get some pussy, man, is
a bitch dies and wills it to you,

404
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,549
and then, maybe.

405
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,934
How's it going, Bunny?

406
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,859
L.T., check it out.

407
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,321
You like that?

408
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,822
Terrific.

409
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,863
I'll send it home.

410
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,286
Hey, Junior.

411
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,534
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

412
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,626
Hey, Rodriguez, that's quite
a shrine you got there.

413
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,968
Thank you, sir.

414
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,012
- You need anything?
- No, sir.

415
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,758
...around this flyboy's neck on
the floor of the hot, hothouse, okay?

416
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,805
Now wait a minute. This guy is
easily three, four times my size.

417
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,928
- Come on, man.
- No. No.

418
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,474
'Cause I got him in the
O'Neill death grip.

419
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,144
He didn't know whether to shit
or go blind, for Christ's sake.

420
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,858
- Hey, what do you say there, L.T.?
- How you doing there, Red?

421
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,147
Not good. Not good.

422
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,146
This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

423
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,442
Full house.

424
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,823
Look like you're doing all
right there, Sergeant.

425
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,160
Yeah, and I ain't
even cheating yet.

426
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,121
Hey, Lieutenant, some
Kentucky windage?

427
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,199
Thanks, Sandy.

428
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,168
Play, Lieutenant?

429
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,710
No. Wouldn't want to
get raped by you guys.

430
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:57,127
Why's that, Lieutenant? What
you saving up to be, Jewish?

431
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,425
Jewish.

432
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,759
I gotta run.

433
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,978
I'll catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

434
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,355
<i>News
is up in five...</i>

435
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,692
Well, that is one
sorry-ass motherfucker.

436
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,654
What do you say there, Bob?

437
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,074
A guy like that make it?
Yes or no?

438
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,290
I have to tell you, that's
precisely what I saw.

439
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,457
I mean, sometimes I just
look at a guy, and I know.

440
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,204
This fella's not gonna make it.

441
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,796
Just no fucking way.

442
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,171
- Yeah!
- I'm going now.

443
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,137
Come on, now!

444
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,398
I want some, now.

445
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,696
<i>'Cause I tell a joke or two</i>

446
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:06,829
<i>Although I might be
laughing loud and hearty</i>

447
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,750
<i>Deep inside I'm blue</i>

448
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,789
<i>So take a good look at my face</i>

449
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:20,343
<i>You'll see my smile
looks out of place</i>

450
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,556
<i>If you look closer,
it's easy to trace</i>

451
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,893
<i>The tracks of my tears...</i>

452
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,229
Yeah!

453
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,888
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

454
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,184
<i>I need you</i>

455
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,854
<i>Need you
Need you</i>

456
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,689
<i>New Year's Day, 1968.</i>

457
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,576
<i>Just another day, staying alive.</i>

458
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,492
<i>There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.</i>

459
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,911
<i>Regiments of NVA moving across.</i>

460
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,455
<i>A lot of little
firefights, ambushes.</i>

461
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,872
<i>We drop a lot of bombs,</i>

462
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,498
<i>then we walk through the jungle
like ghosts in a landscape.</i>

463
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,856
Bunker

464
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,108
Where?

465
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,505
<i>Bravo
Two, Bravo Two-Five.</i>

466
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,504
<i>We got beaucoup bunkers up here.
Over.</i>

467
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,841
<i>Two-five-two, roger.
Bunkers at point.</i>

468
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,639
<i>Two actuals on the way.
I'm out. Over.</i>

469
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,766
Bravo Six, Bravo Six, Bravo Two.

470
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,265
Be advised. There is a
bunker complex up front.

471
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,642
<i>Turning right
on our way down. Over.</i>

472
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,529
See you next week.

473
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,588
<i>Bravo Two. This is Alpha.
Be advised. We're at the tunnels...</i>

474
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,174
<i>- I got swiped three times in my first week.
- ...and one man down at this time. Over.</i>

475
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,046
Taylor, get your ass up on
that flank about 50 meters.

476
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,389
Washington, you cover this side.

477
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,634
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

478
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,894
Bummer.

479
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,071
Christ. Look at that, will you?
The teapot's still boiling.

480
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,989
Man, they were just here.

481
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,995
Man, this is spooky, Sandy.
Let's get out of here.

482
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,405
Watch it. Watch it!

483
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,298
Look what we got, Sal.
We got maps.

484
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,424
We got S-2 stuff.

485
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,923
Man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get out of here!

486
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,971
No, Sal. This is important.
This is important.

487
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,899
Let's leave. Let's go.

488
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,603
Booby trap! Get down!

489
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,447
Medic!

490
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,948
Holy...

491
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,593
God damn it.

492
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,394
We got...

493
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,015
We got two men down, sir.
There was an explosion.

494
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,563
This... We need help, sir. ASAP.

495
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,153
Move your ass out of here! Let's go.
One round would get all you guys out.

496
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,523
Rodriguez, move it!
Junior, let's go!

497
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,149
- Lieutenant.
- What?

498
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,532
Tell Six we need engineers. This
pos is crawling with traps.

499
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,949
They're on their way.
Now listen.

500
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,199
The NVA out of here have been spotted in
the village half a klick down the river.

501
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,050
- Now Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
- Okay.

502
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,587
Also, leave four of your men
here and a medic, okay?

503
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,630
- All right.
- Move it out.

504
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,857
Pull the flanks in!
Let's move!

505
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,033
- Hey, where's Manny?
- Manny!

506
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,410
- Yo, Manny!
- Hey, Washington.

507
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,416
Manny!

508
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,414
- Hey, Manny!
- Manny!

509
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,140
- Washington!
- Yo, Manny.

510
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,289
Manny, where you at?

511
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,860
<i>We had to get to
the village before dark.</i>

512
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,830
<i>So we left Elias with some men to keep
looking and to wait for the engineers.</i>

513
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,542
<i>But it was King who found him,
about 1,000 yards downriver,</i>

514
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,206
<i>not far from the village.</i>

515
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,421
<i>It was the end of the mystery.</i>

516
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,408
The motherfuckers.

517
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,837
<i>The village, which had
stood for maybe 1,000 years,</i>

518
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,134
<i>didn't know we were
coming that day.</i>

519
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,258
<i>If they had, they
would have run.</i>

520
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,844
<i>Barnes was at the
eye of our rage.</i>

521
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,434
<i>And through him,
our Captain Ahab.</i>

522
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,766
<i>He would set things right again.</i>

523
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,608
<i>That day, we loved him.</i>

524
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,066
There he goes, Sarge.

525
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,083
- Check him out.
- Yeah. You got it, Sarge.

526
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,203
Tubbs and Ebenhock, let's go.

527
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,916
Get that stupid
look off your face!

528
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,426
Hey, piggy, piggy. Hey, pig

529
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,681
Don't leave a hooch.
Spread out on the right!

530
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,938
Okay, watch your back!

531
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,480
Let's go!

532
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,654
What do you got here, huh?

533
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,487
Let's go! Move it! Go!

534
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,200
Get over there. Move it!

535
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,370
Come on! Let's go!

536
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,701
Let's go, Junior. Bring them in.

537
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,166
We have some people down here.

538
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,876
Get out of there, you fuckheads!
Move!

539
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,019
Come on!

540
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,694
Put them in the pig pen.

541
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,367
Give me your Willy Pete.

542
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,538
Shut up! Get back!

543
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,874
Fire in the hole!

544
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,298
Shut up! I said shut up!
Shut up!

545
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,883
Get them out of here.

546
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,476
Fuck. We got one.

547
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,266
Get the fuck out of the hole!
Move!

548
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,985
Get the fuck out of there. Let's go!
Come on, motherfucker!

549
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,526
Be cool. Be cool. They're scared, man.
They're scared.

550
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,899
They're scared, huh?
What about me, man?

551
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,114
What about me? I'm sick
of this fucking shit.

552
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,237
Come on, motherfucker, move!

553
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,455
Watch this, fucker!

554
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,790
Fuckers don't want us here, man.

555
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,500
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for, huh?

556
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,584
Yeah, one more!

557
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,587
Hey! Hey!

558
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:10,552
Well, well. What have we here?

559
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:17,726
One, two, three, four MAG 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

560
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,928
We got two, four...

561
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,567
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

562
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,235
Sergeant Warren, you bring
that honcho over here.

563
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,618
Tubbs, get over here.
Junior, burn it.

564
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,493
What the fuck's the matter with you?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

565
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,661
Look like I was gonna
fucking hurt you?

566
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,628
Why didn't you listen to me, huh? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

567
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,091
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole.
Get the fuck up here!

568
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,052
Come here, motherfucker.
What are you smiling at?

569
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,215
- Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?
- Do him, man. Do him!

570
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,968
What are you smiling at, huh? You
want something to smile at, huh?

571
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,060
You want something to
smile at, motherfucker?

572
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,639
Dance, motherfucker!

573
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,438
Do him, man! Do him!

574
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,028
Dance, motherfucker!

575
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,646
Dance! Dance!

576
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,195
Dance!

577
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,159
One-legged motherfucker!

578
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,245
Come on, man. Let's go, man.

579
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,503
Fucking pussy, man.
He's laughing at you.

580
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,881
That's the way the gook laughs.

581
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,807
Yeah, sure you are.

582
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,893
You're real sorry, ain't you?

583
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:46,516
You're just crying your little hearts
out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

584
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,017
Forget about it, Bunny, huh?
Let's go.

585
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,565
What do you say?

586
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,544
Holy shit! You see that
fucking head come apart, man?

587
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,632
I never seen brains
like that before, man.

588
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,437
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show, man.

589
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,523
She probably cut Manny's throat.

590
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,934
She'd probably cut my balls
off if she had the chance.

591
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,278
Bunny, we leave now. Nobody
saw a fucking thing!

592
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,361
- You understand me, Taylor?
- Fucking woman, man.

593
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,572
Not a fucking thing.

594
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,988
Come on, man, let's fucking do her, man.
Let's do this whole fucking village!

595
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,910
Look at the scars on
this gook honcho, Sarge.

596
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,246
Get out of here, Tubbs.

597
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,378
Where'd he get these wounds?

599
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,728
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure.

600
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,023
Ask him why those
weapons are here.

601
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,938
Says they had no choice.

602
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,861
Says the NVA killed the old
honcho when he said no.

603
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,278
Now he says all the
rice is theirs.

604
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,494
Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

605
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,956
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

606
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,382
He doesn't know. He says that the NVA
ain't been around in a couple of months.

607
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,377
Look, maybe he was a scout
or something, Sarge.

608
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,094
Yeah, sure, a scout.

609
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,431
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

610
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,971
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying!
He understands. Don't you, pop?

611
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,938
- Goddamn right he does.
- You bet.

612
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,773
Damn it! He's lying through his teeth.
Come on!

613
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,018
Waste the fucker,
then see who talks.

614
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,146
The boy doesn't fucking
know anything.

615
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,448
He swears he doesn't
know anything.

616
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,266
He hates the NVA, but
they come when they want,

617
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,408
- and they just take the...
- What's the bitch saying?

618
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,161
I don't know. She's going on
about Why'd we kill the pigs,

619
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,379
they're farmers, they got to make a living.
All that kind of shit.

620
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,497
Jesus!

621
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,267
Enough! Shut the fuck up!
Enough.

622
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,330
You tell him he starts talking,
or I'm gonna waste more of them.

623
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,164
Tell him, Lerner!

624
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,757
Hey, Sarge, let us
in on this, all right?

625
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,732
Let's go for it! Let's do
the whole fucking village!

626
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,522
Come on, Sarge! What the
fuck are we waiting for?

627
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,823
Let's do them, all right?

628
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,909
This is his daughter, right?
Right?

629
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,883
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

630
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,722
Barnes!

631
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,605
Barnes!

632
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,563
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

633
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,777
Stay out of this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

634
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,615
You ain't a firing squad,
you piece of shit.

635
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,663
- Get him!
- Get up, Barnes!

636
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,410
Elias! No, no, no!

637
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,588
Chief! Chief, tear
his fucking head off!

638
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,591
Get him! Get him!

639
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,085
Tear him apart!

640
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,095
Come on, Elias!

641
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,467
Send him to hell!
Send him to hell, Elias!

642
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,228
Come on, boys, break it up now!

643
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,357
Break it up!

644
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,316
Break it up!

645
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,232
Come on, Elias, chill!

646
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,576
You're dead, Elias! I swear
to fucking God, you're dead!

647
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,830
You're going to do time!

648
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,370
This shit won't wash,
you fucking puke!

649
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,661
Break it up! Shut up!

650
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,922
Break it up! Listen up!

651
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,339
The captain says to torch this place!
You hear that?

652
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,128
Torch this place!

653
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,762
Blow the weapons in place! Round up
all suspected VC and shake it up!

654
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,179
We ain't got much light left.

655
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,679
Lieutenant, why the fuck
didn't you do something?

656
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,601
What are you talking about?

657
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:22,271
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about!

658
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:26,271
No, I don't. I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, Elias.

659
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:34,241
All right, move it out! Let's go! You
heard the Lieutenant! Move it out!

660
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,661
Taylor, let's go,
for Christ's sake!

661
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,829
Move it out! Police up the
weapons and let's go!

662
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,577
Come on, Harold. It's cool.

663
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,447
Fire in the hole!

664
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,209
Fire in the hole!

665
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,672
Hey, come on.

666
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,720
Fucker. You fucker,
get out of here!

667
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:19,808
Get the fuck off!

668
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,186
Don't do it! Don't do it!

669
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,231
You fucker! What is this, huh?

670
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,695
What are you, a
homosexual, Taylor?

671
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,361
What the fuck is your problem, Taylor?
She's a fucking dink.

672
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,951
She's a fucking
human being, man!

673
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,283
- Fuck you!
- Go fuck a cherry, Taylor.

674
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:44,621
Fucking animal! All of you,
you're fucking animals!

675
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,244
Fucking lame fuck!

676
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,588
You don't belong in the Nam, man.
This ain't your place at all.

677
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,208
You don't fucking get
it, do you, man?

678
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,423
You just don't fucking get it.

679
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,634
It's okay.

680
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,094
Get out of there!

681
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,764
Fuck you, too, man.

682
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,231
Come on, guys. Police up your
dicks and let's get out of here.

683
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,914
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

684
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,788
That dink was reported to me as
NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

685
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,792
My report, sir, will include Lieutenant
Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

686
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,418
All right, Elias.

687
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,217
- Staff Sergeant Barnes?
- Sir!

688
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,013
I want a full report from you on
this when we get back to the CP.

689
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:28,059
You got it, Dai-'Uy, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

690
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,352
Not now, god damn it! Not now.

691
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,564
We'll get into this when we
get back to the base camp.

692
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,482
And I can promise you something.

693
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,950
If I find out there was an illegal
killing, there will be a court-martial.

694
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:44,533
Right now I need every man in the
field, and you two will ceasefire.

695
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,624
Staff Sergeant Barnes,
Sergeant Elias, you hear me?

696
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,959
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

697
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,087
Now, we're going back into that
NVA bunker complex tomorrow.

698
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,581
This time from the East.

699
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,127
You people get some rest

700
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,298
and be back up here at the
CP at 1900 for a briefing.

701
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,254
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

702
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,393
Come on, man.

703
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,972
You think these chucks give
a fuck about you and me?

704
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:14,976
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

705
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,317
And that Bunny, that
motherfucker's crazy.

706
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,446
I mean, he scares me, man.
He just scares me.

707
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,036
Look, you bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

708
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,707
These gooks are a lot
smarter than you think.

709
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,167
You know, Barnes
knows his shit, man.

710
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,753
They was NVA, every
last one of them.

711
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:39,167
Now, he's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

712
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,759
I don't know.

713
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,881
I mean, a Christian don't go around a
village, cutting off heads and shit.

714
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,350
This shit is really getting out of hand,
man. It's going way out of control.

715
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,934
It seems to me that you don't
seem to know the difference,

716
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,774
the way you shoot up
that shit all the time.

717
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,984
I don't know, brothers,

718
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,817
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

719
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,907
Don't worry about it, Sergeant. Elias
won't be able to prove a thing.

720
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,281
- I mean, he's a troublemaker, but...
- Elias is a water-walker,

721
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:13,376
like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war

722
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,995
with one hand tied
around their balls.

723
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,373
Ain't no need or time for
a courtroom out here.

724
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,132
Come on, let's go.

725
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,010
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

726
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,255
How'd it go there, Bob?

727
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,349
Yeah. Atta way, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

728
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,722
He's a fucking rat,
that's what he is.

729
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,942
He's gonna get everybody in
this platoon in deep shit.

730
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,231
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

731
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:44,733
So, what do you think there, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

732
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,368
Bob?

733
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,287
O'Neill, man,
you worry too much.

734
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,540
Sarge will take care of it.

735
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,039
It's a beautiful night.

736
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,542
Yeah. I love
this place at night,

737
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,552
the stars.

738
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,887
There's no right
or wrong in them.

739
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,634
They're just there.

740
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,603
That's a nice way of putting it.

741
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,769
Barnes has got it in
for you, doesn't he?

742
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,405
Barnes believes in
what he's doing.

743
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,574
And you? Do you believe?

744
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,577
In '65, yeah.

745
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,752
Now,

746
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,631
no.

747
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,923
What happened today is
just the beginning.

748
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,343
We're gonna lose this war.

749
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:54,223
Come on. You really think so?

750
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,265
Us?

751
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,227
We been kicking other
people's asses for so long,

752
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,817
I figure it's time
we got ours kicked.

753
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:17,075
<i>Day by day, I struggle to maintain
not only my strength but my sanity.</i>

754
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,125
<i>It's all a blur. I have
no energy to write.</i>

755
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:25,125
<i>I don't know what's right
and what's wrong any more.</i>

756
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,092
<i>The morale of the men is low.</i>

757
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,178
<i>A civil war in the platoon.</i>

758
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,968
<i>Half the men with Elias,
half with Barnes.</i>

759
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,975
<i>There's a lot of
suspicion and hate.</i>

760
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,473
<i>I can't believe we're fighting each
other when we should be fighting them.</i>

761
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,856
<i>Counting days and the six
inches in front of my face.</i>

762
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,319
<i>Not much else.</i>

763
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,072
<i>Hope things are well, Grandma.</i>

764
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,115
<i>Tell Mom and Dad</i> I...

765
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,619
<i>Well, just tell them. Chris.</i>

766
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,725
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you
had that laundry gig all laid out.

767
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,854
Hell, I got to paint myself white just
to get me one of them fucking jobs.

768
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,897
It's all right. I got my
request in for a circumcision.

769
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,736
I'm gonna get my big ass
out of this fucker.

770
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,150
You gonna become a rabbi?

771
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,989
What you gonna do
with that little flap, boy?

772
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,108
Leech.

773
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,201
All right! Move it out!

774
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,875
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

775
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,588
Yeah, I hope so.

776
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,382
Let's go.

777
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,047
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

778
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,593
Sergeant Warren's hit!

779
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,635
What the fuck's going on?

780
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:45,686
They got RPGs man, it's an ambush! They
were just fucking waiting for us here!

781
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,979
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

782
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,318
Taylor, where you going?

783
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,277
Dig! Dig! Down!

784
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,197
God damn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

785
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,319
Right!

786
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,671
Watch out! Rockets!

787
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,344
Where the fuck's Lerner?

788
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,727
He's over there, by the log!

789
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:49,795
Fire mission. Grid. 6-4-9-4-0-2.

790
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,627
Direction. 6-1-0...

791
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,967
Adjust fire, over.

792
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:00,344
Lieutenant, they're gonna get
in tight under the ARTY!

793
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,803
I spotted a cut over there.

794
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,847
Let me get some men and roll up that flank.
I can work right up on them.

795
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,767
Get me Barnes. Look, Elias, I don't know.
We got four down up there.

796
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,481
What do you want me to do?

797
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,526
Where the fuck is Red platoon?

798
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,987
Tell those assholes
to get up here!

799
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,364
Elias, what the fuck are
you doing back here?

800
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,108
Listen to me, Barnes,
there's holes back here.

801
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,528
Third platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

802
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,748
Dinks get men in these holes, they
got us caught in a crossfire.

803
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,991
We'll shoot each other to shit.

804
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,034
Sounds pretty far-out
to me, Elias.

805
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,788
I've seen it happen,
la Drang in '66.

806
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,085
They cut us to fucking pieces!

807
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:35,173
I need three men!

808
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,008
Then you got them. Take off.

809
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,754
You keep pouring off
that cover fire.

810
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,758
I don't wanna be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze.

811
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,761
You don't tell me how
to run my war, Elias!

812
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,731
Now, you go crying and rat fucking
the brigade on your own time!

813
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,726
But out here, you belong to me!
Now move!

814
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,394
You're an asshole, Barnes!

815
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,360
Sergeant, get that
asshole O'Neill up here.

816
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,742
Two Charlie, this is Two!
Be advised move...

817
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:41,740
Stay down!

818
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,081
Stay down!

819
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,918
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

820
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,256
Be right back!

821
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,389
Sarge! Short round!

822
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,945
Medic!

823
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,883
- God!
- Medic!

824
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,230
Satchel charge!

825
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,235
Doc!

826
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,484
- Doc, help me out!
- Yeah.

827
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,155
Jesus!

828
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,248
- You okay?
- Don't leave me, man.

829
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,992
- All right.
- Don't leave me.

830
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:18,621
Hey, Gator, you're
gonna be okay, man.

831
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,042
Don't leave me, man.

832
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,175
- You'll be okay.
- Here you go, man.

833
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,213
Hang in there.

834
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,961
- Drop your rucks.
- Just hang in there.

835
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,838
Taylor, you're coming with us.

836
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,223
Please, don't go.

837
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,139
- You're gonna be okay.
- Come on!

838
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,438
Doc! Take care of him, man.

839
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,519
Redleg, Redleg,
Ripper Bravo Two actual.

840
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,856
Adjustment follows. Grid.

841
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,616
You ignorant asshole!

842
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,365
What the fuck
coordinates you giving?

843
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:55,491
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

844
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,120
You know that? You know that?

845
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,871
Shit!

846
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,881
Redleg. Redleg.
Ripper Bravo Two.

847
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,675
Check your fire!
Check your fire!

848
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,312
They're coming.

849
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,232
Stagger yourself across this line.
Shoot anything that moves.

850
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,903
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

851
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,031
Any one of them gets through,
we are truly fucked.

852
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,833
Where the hell are you going?

853
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,752
Down by the river,
about 100 meters,

854
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,296
in case they try to flank us.

855
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,417
Third platoon's coming up to
our rear, so watch for them.

856
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,293
Hey. Can I go with you?

857
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,301
No. I move faster alone.

858
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,105
Come here.

859
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,146
Let's let arty do a little
bit of the work here.

860
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,236
We tell everybody to
pull back to the church.

861
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,107
We link up with third platoon.
You got that?

862
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,027
What about Elias? If we
pull back, he'll be cutoff.

863
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,075
You just haul ass,
too, Lieutenant.

864
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,124
I'll get him.

865
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,908
- I got two of them fuckers, man.
- I got one!

866
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,877
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!

867
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,249
Crawford!

868
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,218
Oh, man!

869
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,056
- Kiss my ass. I never thought I'd get hit.
- It's a lung, babe.

870
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,175
You got two of them fuckers.

871
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,677
Where's Elias?

872
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,724
Sarge, there's a bunch of
gooks came through there.

873
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,222
We got three of them fuckers.

874
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,145
Hey, didn't you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

875
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,565
Now, get your wounded man and get
the fuck back to the church.

876
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,607
Get going-

877
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,402
- But Elias is still out there, Sarge.
- Taylor, I'll get him!

878
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,277
You get Crawford in now, before I
article 15 both your asses. Move!

879
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,487
Move it.

880
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,653
- All right, men. He's coming.
- Hold him down.

881
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,522
Medic, where the fuck are you?

882
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,864
Drag him there.

883
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,863
It's gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

884
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,282
Taylor, where you going?

885
01:16:57,071 --> 01:17:00,314
Elias is dead. Fall
back with the platoon.

886
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,275
- Get going.
- He's dead?

887
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,869
Yeah. Yeah, he's back
there about 100 meters.

888
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,706
- You saw him? Where?
- He's dead.

889
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,243
And there's gooks all over the
goddamn place. Get moving.

890
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,426
Okay. Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

891
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:09,842
Let's go. Move it! Move it!
Okay, let's go!

892
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,792
You okay, Harold?
You're on the next one.

893
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,376
You're okay, bud.

894
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:24,750
Fuck!

895
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,597
- They got Elias!
- What?

896
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,556
Back down! Back down there!

897
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:49,153
<i>Snake one-niner, fly four,
there's still one on the deck down there.</i>

898
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,243
<i>Bring in the gunships, over.</i>

899
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:17,056
<i>Hold your armor! Guns! Guns!
Pull off! Pull off!</i>

900
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,554
<i>We're trying to come
around my side.</i>

901
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:16,911
He killed him.

902
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,873
I know that he killed him. I saw
his eyes when he came back in.

903
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,334
How do you know the
dinks didn't get him?

904
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,873
You got no proof, man.

905
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,418
Proof's in the eyes, man.
When you know, you know.

906
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,757
You were there, Rhah, and I
know what you were thinking.

907
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,717
I say we frag that
fucker tonight.

908
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,962
I go with that. An
eye for an eye.

909
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,591
I say let Military Justice
do the job on him.

910
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,474
Come on. Fuck the Military Justice!
Are you joking me?

911
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,346
Whose story you think
they're gonna believe?

912
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,849
O'Neill's? Bunny's? Wolfe's?
Bullshit!

913
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,726
Shit, man, you try that

914
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,649
and Barnes will shove it right back
up your ass with a candle on it.

915
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,397
Well, then what do you
suggest we do, huh?

916
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,572
I suggest you all
watch your own asses,

917
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,910
because Barnes gonna be
coming down on all of them.

918
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,491
You just gonna
forget about Elias

919
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,706
and all the good times we
done had right in here?

920
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:05,668
Shit. You're trying to cure the
headache by cutting off the head.

921
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,043
Elias didn't ask you to
fight his battles for him.

922
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,629
If there's a heaven, and
God I hope there is,

923
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,508
I know he's sitting up there
drunk as a fucking monkey

924
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,051
and smoking shit,

925
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,555
'cause he done left
his pains down here.

926
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:22,678
You're wrong, man.

927
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,180
Any way you cut it, Barnes
is a fucking murderer.

928
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,226
Right on.

929
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,726
Taylor, I remember when
you first came in here

930
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,854
telling me how much you
admired the bastard.

931
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:33,981
I was wrong.

932
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,859
Wrong? You ain't never
been right... about nothing!

933
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:41,036
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good...

934
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:45,242
Barnes been shot seven
times and he ain't dead.

935
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,619
Does that mean
anything to you, huh?

936
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,963
Barnes ain't meant to die.

937
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:54,129
The only thing that can
kill Barnes is Barnes.

938
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,049
Talking about killing?

939
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,187
Y'all experts?

940
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,651
Y'all know about killing?

941
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:19,321
I'd like to hear
about it, potheads.

942
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,711
Why do you smoke this shit?
So as to escape from reality?

943
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,586
Me, I don't need this shit.

944
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,590
I am reality.

945
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,099
There's the way it ought to be.

946
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,896
And there's the way it is.

947
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,781
Elias was full of shit.

948
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,448
Elias was a crusader.

949
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,080
Now, I got no fight

950
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,666
with any man who
does what he's told,

951
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,878
but when he don't, the
machine breaks down.

952
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:16,920
And when the machine breaks
down, we break down.

953
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,678
And I ain't gonna allow that

954
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,763
in any of you.

955
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,224
Not one.

956
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,534
Y'all love Elias.

957
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,658
Oh, you wanna kick ass.

958
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,044
Yeah.

959
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,172
Well, here I am, all
by my lonesome,

960
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,515
and ain't nobody gonna know.

961
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,815
Six of you boys against me.

962
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,193
Kill me.

963
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,130
I shit on all of you.

964
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,713
You motherfucker!

965
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,219
Give it to him! Whoop his ass.
Come on.

966
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,390
Yes, man.

967
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,104
- Come on, man! Go.
- Get him!

968
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,894
- Oh, fuck, come on.
- Get him, Chris. Come on.

969
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,733
Come on, boy! Come on!

970
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,564
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

971
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,907
You'll go dinky
down in LBJ, man.

972
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,535
Ten years for killing
an enlisted man.

973
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:10,575
Ten years, you'll climb
the fucking walls, man.

974
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,329
Don't do it.

975
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,099
Death?

976
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,440
What do you all
know about death?

977
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:54,825
<i>They sent us back
into the valley the next day</i>

978
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,952
<i>about 2,000 meters from Cambodia</i>

979
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,999
<i>into a battalion perimeter.</i>

980
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:02,586
<i>It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.</i>

981
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,503
<i>Alpha Company had been hit hard the
day before by a sizable force,</i>

982
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,248
<i>and Charlie Company had
been probed that night.</i>

983
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,296
<i>There were other battalions in the valley.
We weren't the only ones.</i>

984
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:49,546
<i>But we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.</i>

985
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:53,675
<i>Somewhere out there was the
entire 141st NVA regiment.</i>

986
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,737
Caught those motherfuckers
trying to pull some shit

987
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,955
on Charlie Company last night.

988
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,495
They found maps on them, man.

989
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,664
Got a friend at battalion,

990
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,708
says they had every fucking
foxhole here fixed on it.

991
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:27,880
Distances, tree-lines, our
claymores, everything.

992
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,384
This is bad, man. I
got bad vibes here.

993
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:35,220
I also heard we're in
fucking Cambodia right now.

994
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,594
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.

995
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,562
You wanted to see me, sir?

996
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:45,317
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like
you got Elias' squad now.

997
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,902
Squad, sir?

998
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,693
I didn't know we were still referring
to this platoon in terms of squads.

999
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,361
All right, look.

1000
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,361
I want you to take those two
holes right there and there.

1001
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,614
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

1002
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:58,831
Yeah.

1003
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,791
Begging your pardon, sir.

1004
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:03,628
My two holes are far enough apart
you can run a regiment through them

1005
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,711
and never see them.

1006
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,421
I have five live
bodies left, sir.

1007
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,791
Look, I don't wanna hear
your problems, Ramucci.

1008
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,543
You'll get new men any day.

1009
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,546
Meantime, you make do like
everybody else. Okay?

1010
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,969
- I didn't ask for this job.
- I don't want to hear it.

1011
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:18,100
- Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
- Yeah, that's right.

1012
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:22,063
I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell
the truth, I don't give a shit, okay?

1013
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,229
- I just don't give a flying fuck any more.
- Right.

1014
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:34,325
I'm glad I ain't
going with them.

1015
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,155
Somewhere out there is the
beast and he hungry tonight.

1016
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,162
What a fucking bummer.

1017
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:46,292
Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm
still dealing with this shit.

1018
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,546
What's the matter with you, man?

1019
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,303
How come you ain't
writing nobody?

1020
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,339
What about your folks?

1021
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,683
That grandma you was
telling me about?

1022
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:02,762
Girl?

1023
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:09,148
You got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

1024
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,146
Nah, there's nobody.

1025
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,826
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

1026
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,121
Gotta control that.
Bring a man down.

1027
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,537
I remember when you first
come out here, to the bush.

1028
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,285
You was green as a...

1029
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,044
Did you ever get caught in a mistake
that you just can't get out of, King?

1030
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,259
There's a way out
of anything, man.

1031
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,221
Just keep your pecker
hard and your powder dry,

1032
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,681
and the world will turn.

1033
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,186
How many days you short?

1034
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:47,102
Nah, it's not just me.

1035
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:51,227
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

1036
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:55,072
People like Barnes just go on making
up the rules any way they want.

1037
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:58,484
So what do we do? Sit in
the middle and suck on it.

1038
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,572
We just don't add up
to dry shit, King.

1039
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,619
Whoever said we did, man?

1040
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,414
All you got to do is
make it out of here,

1041
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,127
and it's all gravy.

1042
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:12,005
Every day, the rest
of your life, gravy.

1043
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,002
Oh, shit, superlifer.

1044
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,054
Hey, King, collect up your shit.
Your orders just come through.

1045
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,676
Now look, man. Don't
fuck with me.

1046
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:26,521
What do you need, a written
invitation, for Christ's sake?

1047
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,389
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!

1048
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,317
The lifers have made a mistake.

1049
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,935
They cut me some slack, Taylor.

1050
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,437
Look, you get your
freight to Rodriguez.

1051
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:37,281
You got 10 minutes to make the last
fucking chopper out of here, man,

1052
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:40,071
'cause if you're not
on it, I'm gonna be.

1053
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,155
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

1054
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,122
That's great, King. I'm
happy for you, man.

1055
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,913
- You take it on home for me, okay?
- Yeah.

1056
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,035
You got my address.

1057
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:51,583
You know where you can get a
hold of me anytime, right?

1058
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,753
I gotta beat it, man. I don't
want to miss that chopper.

1059
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,630
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1060
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:06,265
Remember now, take it easy. Don't
think too much. Don't you be no fool.

1061
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,439
Remember, ain't no such thing as a
coward out here. Don't mean nothing.

1062
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,941
My man.

1063
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,533
I'll walk you out, man.

1064
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,827
Take it easy, King.

1065
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,666
I'm gonna take it any way
I can get it, brother.

1066
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,285
I hear you. Later.

1067
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,500
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge!

1068
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:35,164
Oh, man! Don't touch that.

1069
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,791
I got to get on a chopper, man.

1070
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,550
So what's the problem?

1071
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,294
Says he can't walk.

1072
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,966
Shit.

1073
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,179
Martin, get your boots on.

1074
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:54,525
And the next time I catch you spraying
skeeter repellent on your fucking feet,

1075
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,985
I'm gonna court-martial
your nigger ass.

1076
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,148
Well, then court-martial
me, motherfucker!

1077
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,992
Bust my ass. Send me
to fucking Long Binh!

1078
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:05,535
You do your fucking worst!

1079
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:08,906
You white folks have got your
last klick out of Junior!

1080
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:13,286
- O'Neill, get me that centipede.
- Sergeant?

1081
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:17,294
Yeah, that long, hairy,
red and black bastard

1082
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,257
I found in the ammo crate.

1083
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,379
I'm gonna put it in this boy's
crotch, see if he can walk.

1084
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:24,971
I remember now.

1085
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:27,433
Hey. Now hold up, man!

1086
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:29,894
You just hold up and
wait, all right?

1087
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,684
Fuck it! I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

1088
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,854
Fucking pussy, man. Hey, Sarge,
I got to have him in my hole?

1089
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,896
Yeah.

1090
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,983
Bob, I'd like to speak
to you a minute.

1091
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,610
I can't take it no more.

1092
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:51,119
- I'd like to speak to you, Bob.
- Yeah, what is it?

1093
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:55,119
Bob, I got Elias' R&R. It's
coming up in three days, here.

1094
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:58,248
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii, maybe see Patsy.

1095
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:00,921
Hey, Bob, come on, I never asked
you for a fucking thing over here.

1096
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:03,089
You know, I was thinking maybe...
Well, to be honest with you,

1097
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:05,258
I was hoping you'd put me on that
chopper with King out of here.

1098
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:07,427
What do you say, chief-a-rooney?

1099
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,969
I can't do that for you, Red.

1100
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,469
We need every swinging dick in
the field, and you know that.

1101
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,641
Hey, Bob, come on. You can
talk to me, for Christ's sake.

1102
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,856
All I'm asking for is
three fucking days, here.

1103
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:18,943
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you "no."

1104
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,316
So get back in your foxhole.

1105
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,573
Bob, I got a bad feeling
on this one, all right?

1106
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,785
I mean, I got a bad feeling.

1107
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,072
I don't think I'm gonna
make it out of here.

1108
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,620
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

1109
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,707
Everybody got to
die sometime, Red.

1110
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,545
Oh, shit.

1111
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:03,191
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

1112
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,702
Where's that fucking ambush?

1113
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:22,290
They ain't even waiting till later.
It's fucking coming now, man.

1114
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,879
Right fucking now.

1115
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:33,138
You know, Junior, some of
the things we done, man...

1116
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,763
I don't feel like we
done something wrong.

1117
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,722
But sometimes, man,

1118
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,518
I get this bad feeling.

1119
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,236
I told the Padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

1120
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:51,486
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

1121
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,829
The only worry you got is dying.

1122
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,790
And if that happens, you
won't know about it anyway.

1123
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,534
So what the fuck, man.

1124
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:02,462
Shit, I got to be in
this hole with you, man?

1125
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:05,124
I just know I
shouldn't have come.

1126
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,719
Don't you worry, Junior.

1127
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,714
You're hanging with Audie
Murphy here, my man.

1128
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:17,307
Bravo Three, Bravo Three, Bravo Six,
send me a grid. Send me a grid. Over.

1129
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:20,689
<i>Can't, sir. Pinned down.
They're in the fucking trees.</i>

1130
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:23,059
Okay, Three Alpha,
now calm down, son.

1131
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,903
I'll get you a fire mission ASAP.
Smoke will be first.

1132
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:28,067
<i>Lieutenant's dead.
Radioman looks dead, sir.</i>

1133
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,565
<i>I don't know where
the map is, Captain!</i>

1134
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:31,862
<i>They're all around us,
sir, hundreds of them!</i>

1135
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:33,986
<i>I can hear them talking gook.</i>

1136
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:37,115
Okay, Three Alpha. Now spot that
smoke, and tell me where to shift.

1137
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,913
Just calm down, son. Hang in there.
We'll get you out.

1138
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,703
Just tell me where the rounds hit.
Over.

1139
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:01,355
Three Alpha Six. How
about those rounds, son?

1140
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:03,349
Can you adjust fire? Over.

1141
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,529
Three Alpha Six.

1142
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:12,115
If you can't talk, son, just
key your handset twice. Over.

1143
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:27,799
Shit.

1144
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:15,129
Trip flare! Rodriguez's hole!

1145
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:21,767
RPG!

1146
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:25,935
Doc, Doc!

1147
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:27,478
Taylor, Francis.

1148
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:29,184
Over here, man.

1149
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:33,614
What the fuck's going on? Rodriguez's
hole just got nailed, man!

1150
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:36,450
Gooks, man. We got gooks
in the fucking perimeter.

1151
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,114
Oh, shit! That's it.

1152
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:39,862
They got through Alpha Company.

1153
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,331
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, okay?

1154
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:47,874
Fuck! Two, air strike's coming in.
They're gonna be laying snake and nape.

1155
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,793
Don't get out of your fucking hole.
Stay right here, man.

1156
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:52,217
Fuck.

1157
01:38:58,391 --> 01:38:59,677
They're probing us.

1158
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,371
They're gonna be going up and down this
line all night trying to get through.

1159
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:05,604
All right. Stay here. Stay cool.
I'll be right back.

1160
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:10,188
<i>Whiskey, Foxtrot,
Foxtrot, Echo, Whiskey. Over.</i>

1161
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:27,117
Who is it?

1162
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,584
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1163
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,634
It's the ambush. Over here, man.
Hurry.

1164
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:44,768
Fuck it up.

1165
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,557
Shit. Quiet.

1166
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:50,183
They're all over the place.
Hundreds of them, moving this way!

1167
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,357
They wiped us out, man!
We didn't have a chance!

1168
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,320
- Where's the CP?
- Back there.

1169
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:58,657
You guys, get out of here!
They're right on my ass!

1170
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,867
They ain't stopping for shit!

1171
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,156
Hey, Taylor, man, let's didi.

1172
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:06,869
You go.

1173
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,216
There!

1174
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,917
No. Hold it. Hold it.

1175
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:13,314
Out of the hole! Fast!

1176
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:18,691
Get out of the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1177
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:23,489
Let's go! Let's go! Francis,
move your fucking ass!

1178
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,406
They're gonna fucking...

1179
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,223
- Follow me.
- Wait.

1180
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,650
Die, you motherfuckers!

1181
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,411
Get back!

1182
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:19,460
It's fucking beautiful!

1183
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:23,173
- Let's fucking do it!
- Where are you going?

1184
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:32,518
- All right!
- Now come on, motherfuckers!

1185
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:39,731
Come on. You can do
better than that!

1186
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:43,026
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1187
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:47,151
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1188
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,836
All right. Get me Bravo.
Right away.

1189
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:49,759
Charlie Company reports
hand-to-hand on perimeter, sir.

1190
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,757
Three holes are down.
They need help.

1191
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:55,135
Okay. Get two squads from Alpha
down there right away. Go. Go.

1192
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,103
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1193
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,266
Hey, stupid, where
the fuck you going?

1194
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:10,404
Eagle Six...

1195
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,624
Son of a bitch.

1196
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:21,453
Can't you get anybody?

1197
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,581
Damn it! Negative contact!
Can't raise Barnes.

1198
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,253
Two Bravo, Two Charlie, nothing.

1199
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:26,340
Get me Six!

1200
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,881
Bravo Six! Bravo Six! Oh, God!

1201
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,596
Get him in!

1202
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:38,102
They're coming through all over!
I can't do anything!

1203
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,186
Where's Barnes?

1204
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:41,439
Shit, he's dead! I think
they're all dead.

1205
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,651
Doc, he's dead. Six, LT, Six.

1206
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:48,443
Captain. Captain, we've been overrun.
We're pulling back! Over.

1207
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:51,658
God damn it, Lieutenant. Where
are you gonna pull back to?

1208
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,697
They're all over the perimeter.

1209
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:57,823
Now you be advised. You will hold
in place, and you will fight.

1210
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:00,621
That means you, Lieutenant.
Bravo Six out.

1211
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:32,986
Be advised. We've got zips
in the wire down here.

1212
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:35,906
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.</i>

1213
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,245
<i>We're hot to trot and packing snake
and nape but we're bingo on fuel.</i>

1214
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,334
For the record, it's my call.

1215
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,204
Dump everything you've
got left on my pos.

1216
01:45:45,214 --> 01:45:49,504
I say again, expend all
remaining in my perimeter.

1217
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,882
It's a lovely fucking war.
Bravo Six out.

1218
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:58,759
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.</i>

1219
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:02,103
<i>Get them in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.</i>

1220
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,519
<i>We're coming cocked
for treetops.</i>

1221
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:29,714
Barnes!

1222
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:33,843
Barnes!

1223
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:39,515
No!

1224
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:31,057
Get me a medic.

1225
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:35,358
Go on, boy!

1226
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:54,748
Do it.

1227
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:29,287
We got men wounded and
live gooks at 3 o'clock.

1228
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:32,498
Look down here.
Check them out.

1229
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:36,829
Come on, Elmo. Move
your flea-bitten ass!

1230
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:44,169
Hey, you okay? You all right?

1231
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:46,638
Can you walk, huh?

1232
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:52,094
Hey, Doc, we need a medic up here.
Come on, Elmo.

1233
01:50:52,104 --> 01:50:54,471
Come on, Doc, we
got wounded here.

1234
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:16,075
Yeah. That must have
been some fucking fight.

1235
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:18,878
You alone here, man?

1236
01:51:19,965 --> 01:51:20,965
Yeah.

1237
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:24,963
The bunch of fucking
faggots, they all left me.

1238
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:17,479
122 wounded and still counting.

1239
01:52:17,481 --> 01:52:20,815
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1240
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:23,901
122 and still counting. Over.

1241
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:33,824
- Hey, Taylor, that you?
- Hey, Francis.

1242
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,948
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- I'm okay. How you doing?

1243
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,329
Fine, man. Just fine.
Hey, dig it.

1244
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:41,999
We two timers, man. We're
gonna get out of here, boy.

1245
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:46,215
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1246
01:52:46,218 --> 01:52:47,800
Sergeant O'Neill.

1247
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:51,383
- How you doing?
- Well, I'm just fine, sir.

1248
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:54,508
Well, that's good. 'Cause
you got second platoon.

1249
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,179
Yes, sir.

1250
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:08,028
- You ready?
- You bet.

1251
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:39,870
<i>I think
now, looking back,</i>

1252
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:44,743
<i>we did not fight the enemy.
We fought ourselves.</i>

1253
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:47,495
<i>And the enemy was in us.</i>

1254
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:51,711
<i>The war is over for me now,</i>

1255
01:54:51,968 --> 01:54:55,587
<i>but it will always be
there the rest of my days</i>

1256
01:54:56,473 --> 01:54:58,556
<i>as I'm sure Elias will be,</i>

1257
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:02,844
<i>fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession of my soul.</i>

1258
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,393
<i>There are times since,</i>

1259
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,984
<i>I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.</i>

1260
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:15,068
<i>But, be that as it may,</i>

1261
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:17,157
<i>those of us who did make it</i>

1262
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,447
<i>have an obligation
to build again,</i>

1263
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,405
<i>to teach to others what we know,</i>

1264
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:26,125
<i>and to try with what's
left of our lives</i>

1265
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:29,708
<i>to find a goodness and
meaning to this life.</i>
