00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:11,154
CUTTER: Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.

4
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,700
The first part is called the Pledge.

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,120
The magician shows you
something ordinary...

6
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,623
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

7
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,046
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

8
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,674
He shows you this object...

9
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,843
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

10
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,638
...to see that it is, indeed, real.

11
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,933
Yeah, unaltered, normal.

12
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,148
But of course, it probably isn't.

13
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,402
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

14

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,834
The second act is called the Turn.

16
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,268
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

17
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,065
...and makes it
do something extraordinary.

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,448
Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...

19
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,910
...because, of course,
you're not really looking.

20
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,204
You don't really wanna know.

21
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,793
You want to be fooled.

22
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,421
But you wouldn't clap yet...

23
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:56,218
...because making something
disappear isn't enough.

24
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,138
You have to bring it back.

25
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,143
That's why every magic trick
has a third act.

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,895
The hardest part.

27
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,899
The part we call the Prestige.

28
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,734

The Prestige. And did Robert Angier...

...the Great Danton, your employer...

31
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,625
...get to that final part
of his trick that night?

32
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,586
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

33
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,257
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

34
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,134
I followed him.

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,554
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

36
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,974
PROSECUTOR: Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

37
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,225
I'm an ingénieur.

38
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,730
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

39
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,939
PROSECUTOR:
So, Mr. Cutter...

40
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,276
...was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

41
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,194
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

42
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,487
No, no. It was...

43
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,825
The tank was brought on for the first
trick and then taken off-stage.

44
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,162
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,747
How large was this tank?

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,501
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

47
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,044
How do you think Mr. Borden...

48
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,673
...was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

49
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,633
He's a magician. Ask him.

DEFENDER:
I ask again that this man explain...

52
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,346
...the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

53
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,015
The Real Transported Man...

54
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,185
...is one of the most sought-after
illusions in this business.

55
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,853
I have the right to sell it on.

56
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,606
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

57
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,818
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

58
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,654
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

59
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,073
...but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

60
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,368
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

61
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,121
...I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

62
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,874
Might this be
an acceptable compromise?

63
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,479
GUARD: I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,068
Not my idea, sir.

65
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,487
The warden saw his show
in Manchester last year...

66
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,239
...where he vanished into thin air.

67
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,367
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,203
(SHOUTING)

69
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,039
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

70
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,376
...is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

71
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,715
Check the locks.

72

My name is Owens.

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,939
I'm a solicitor.

75
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,776
I represent Lord Caldlow, accomplished
amateur magician and historian...

76
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,653
BORDEN:
How much?

77
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,823
- Lord Caldlow is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

78
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,283
Five thousand pounds.

79
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,952
Talk with Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.

80
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

81
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,667
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

82
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,004
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

83
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,463
Even for your daughter?

84
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,843
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

85
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,388
- ...your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

86
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,975
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

87

be removed from his care.

88

No, the girl will be an orphan.

I know you're no stranger to
the workhouse. It's better than here?

I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

91

And I'm offering your daughter
a future.

92
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,453
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

Well, think it over.

94
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,670
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

95
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,215
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

96
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,135
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

97
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,845
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

98
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,515
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

99
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,519
...that the papers said
was better even than your original.

100
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:23,068
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

101
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,196
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

102
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,699

A cipher. An enigma.

104
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,801
A search. A search for answers.

105
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,519
Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey...

106
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:03,400
...it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.

107
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:09,572
See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...

108
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:15,537
...but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.

109
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,710
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

- Yes, sir.

00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,889
Well, quite a reception.

113
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,433
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,978
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

115
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,646
For as long as it takes.

116
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,983
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

117
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,695
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

118
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,115
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

119
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,291
Whoa, whoa.

120
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,713
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

121
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,662
Ah!

122
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:29,587
ALLEY: I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

123
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,511
Not the welcome I was expecting.

124
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,516
I know you.

125
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:50,066
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

126
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,529
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

I'm Alley.

128
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,700
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

129
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,411
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

130
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,415
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

131
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,085
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

132
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,421
I brought a lot of money.

133
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,131
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

134
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,177
I simply can't help you.

135
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,639
I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.

136

That was just days
after he first met me.

142

BORDEN: We were two young men
at the start of a great career.

143
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,126
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

144
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,462
Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.

Bind her feet around the ankle.

00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,613
Are either of you

- No.
- No.

(TICKING)

154
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,144
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

155
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,896
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

156
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,858
...and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

157
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,736
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

158
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,864
- ...with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

160
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,161
A bullet catch is suicide.

161
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,248
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

162
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,751
- Fine. Use a plant.
ANGIER: You can't for every trick.

163
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,754
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

164
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,258
But the point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

165
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,219
...that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

166
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,555
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

167
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,765
- All right.
- Yeah.

168
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,725
I suppose you have such a trick.

169
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,311
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

170
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,021
No.
No one else could do my trick.

171
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,231
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

172
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,276
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

173
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,612
...it might be only he's
prepared to do it.

174
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,156
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

175
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,908
He won't get his hands dirty.

176
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,454
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

177
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,332
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

178
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,751
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

179
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,461
I know the bloke on the door.

180
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,963
You two go and see that show...

181
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,007
...and whichever one of you
can tell me...

182
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,051
...how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

183
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,511
...gets a prize.
BORDEN: All right.

184
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,346
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

185
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,306
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

186
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,808
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

187
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,102
The top theatrical agent in London.

188
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,188
I saw you drop the knot again.

189
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,691
JULIA: I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights you don't get it, do you?

190
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,821
I mean, if that knot slips and
Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

191
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,325
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

192
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,121
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

193
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,373
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

194
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,668
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

195
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,169
Hey, Borden, he said no.

196
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,672
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

197
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,757
Listen, no more mistakes.

198
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,510
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

199
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,513
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

200
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,562
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

201
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,024
- He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
- Don't you worry he'll steal your tricks?

202
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,485
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

203
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:49,740
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

204
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,243
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

205
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,870
Of course you can't trust him.

206
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,746
I think he's all right.

207
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,249
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

208
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,128
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

209
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,839
...so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

210
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,091
(CLAPPING)

211
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,415
ANGIER: You're wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN: No, it is.

212
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,044
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

213
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,338
This is a performance right here.

214
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,757
This is why no one
can detect his method.

215
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,093
Total devotion to his art.

216
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,265
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

217
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:02,063
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

218
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,233
All right.

219
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,320
ANGIER: I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

220
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,990
Or fish. Look.

221
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't know. Hang on a second.

222
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,414
He must be strong as an ox.

223
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,503
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

224
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,131
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

225
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,260
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

226
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,012
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

227
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,849
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

228
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,477
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

229
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,853
I promised my family...

230
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,898
...I wouldn't embarrass them
with my theatrical endeavors.

231
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,318
I thought of a name for you.

232
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,697
The Great Danton.

233
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,115
(ANGIER CHUCKLES)

234
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,324
Do you like it?

235
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,661
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

236
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,838
ANGIER: Borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic.

237
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,513
But what does he know
of self-sacrifice?

238
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,520
You bloody fool.

239
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,984
(CLAPPING)

240
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,467
- He killed it.
- What?

241
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,676
What's wrong?

242
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,889
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

243
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,311
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

244
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,480
(CLAPPING)

245
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,399
No, he killed it.

246
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,735
No.

247
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,744
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

248
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,915
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

249
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,837
He's a sharp lad, your son.

250
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,590
Oh, he's my nephew.

251
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,133
Oh.

252
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,889
You're the lucky one today.

253
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,787
Are you watching closely?

254
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,959
Look closer.

255
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,797
Never show anyone.

256
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,593
They'll beg you and flatter you for the
secret, but as soon as you give it up...

257
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,220
...you'll be nothing to them.

258
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,597
You understand? Nothing.

259
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,642
The secret impresses no one.

260
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,312
The trick you use it for is everything.

261
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:39,113
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

262
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,826
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

263
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,829
So I could use a cup of tea.

264
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:51,333
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

265
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,962
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?

267
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,340
I think so.

268
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,135
So I'll see you again?

CUTTER: Angier's machine.

272
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,973
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

273
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,935
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

274
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,062
This was built by a wizard.

275
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:57,858
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

276
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,404
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

277
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,281
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

278
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,243
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

279
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

280
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,789
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

281
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,378
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

282
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,422
Most disappointing of all, sir...

283
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,968
...it has no trick.

284
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,721
It's real.

JUDGE:
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

286
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,271
CUTTER:
Yes.

287
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,900
This is the place where the
performer's hand reaches through...

288
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,777
...to the trick padlock.

289
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,280
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

290
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,824
Yeah, with one important difference:

291
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,909
This isn't a trick lock.

292
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,995
It's been switched for a real one.

293
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,080
What a way to kill someone.

294
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,084
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

295
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,297
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes brutal truths...

296
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,341
...to amaze, to shock.

297
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,886
Even without an audience?

298
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,763
There was an audience.

You see, this water tank...

300
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,146
...was of particular significance
to these two men.

301
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:21,525
Particularly awful significance.

willing to bind this lovely young woman?

If you would tie her wrists.

304
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,204
Bind her feet around the ankle.

No.

tie a strong knot.

He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.

- Where did you get all of...?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

333

- So...
- We can't afford to pay him.

Money will come
when we get the audience.

335

But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,585
Thank you.

508
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,257
Sir? In the third row there.

509
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,260
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

511
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,888
This isn't mine.

512
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,141
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

513
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,601
I believe she has yours.

Thank you.

516
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,403
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

517
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,405
I'm so nervous.

518
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,116
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

519
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:33,079
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

520
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,048
Put a cloth over.

521
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,010
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

MAN 1: We've seen them all.

525
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,906
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

526
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,494
Two volunteers, please. A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

527
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,874
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

528
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,877
...or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

529
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,257
Madam, if you'll place one hand
on the back of the cage...

530
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,592
...one hand on the front.

531
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,638
Sir, one hand on the bottom
of the cage, one hand on the top.

- No.

ANGIER: What's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

538
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,995
We have a week's engagement.

539
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,791
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

540
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,377
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

541
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,879
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

542
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,716
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

543
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,387
CUTTER:
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

544
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,557
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act...

545
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,601
The name stays.

546
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:25,566
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

547
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,527
I have a couple of methods to try out.

548
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,989
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

549
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,949
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

550
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,119
...there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

551
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,955
Engineers, scientists, you know?

552
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,291
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

555
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,770
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

556
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,065
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

557
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,068
Two of them.

558
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,113
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

559
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,657
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

560
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,952
And not much else.
Our work is secret.

561
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,455
Is that a cipher?

562
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,626
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

563
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,545
Simple, but time-consuming
to translate...

564
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,672
...even when you have
the five-letter keyword.

565
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,591
Which is?

566
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,634
We magicians have a circle of trust.

567
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,764
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

568
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,973
Maybe I bought it.

569
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,477
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

570
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,314
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

571
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,615
Tesla built one for another magician.

572
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,035
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

573
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,915
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

574
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,625
But he would never talk about it.

575
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,711
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

576
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,925
Finish your drink.

577
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,260
I wanna show you something.

578
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,680
I think you'll have a special
appreciation for our work.

579
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,226
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

580
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,061
Who's gonna believe you?

581
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,397
Not long now.

582
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,983
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

583
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,777
Tesla electrified the whole town...

584
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,571
...in exchange for using
the generators when we need to.

585
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,243
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

586
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,037
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

587
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,890
Where are the wires?

588
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,560
Exactly.

589
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,948
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

590
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,076
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

591
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,538
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

592
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,041

in a few days, Mr. Angier.

to reconsider...

- ...his presentation.

612
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,365

to appear under any such restrictions.

Happiness that should have been mine.

But I was wrong.

His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I envied.

The family life
that he craves one minute...

demanding freedom.

So, what's hers?

Maybe Sarah.

get your attention, ask:

Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

677
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,617
I need something impossible.

678
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:43,165
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

679
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,959
It's a lie.

680
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,086
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

681
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,131
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

682
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,844
The first time
I tried to change the world...

683
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,638
...I was hailed as a visionary.

684
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:03,769
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

685
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,731
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

686
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,150
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

687
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,027
What you want is simply expensive.

688
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,655
If I were to build for you this machine...

689
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,491
...you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

690
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,995
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

691
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,790
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

692
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,835
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

693
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,837
Price is not an object.

694
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,841
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

695
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,176
I'm not sure I follow.

696
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,054
Go home. Forget this thing.

697
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,348
I can recognize an obsession.

698
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,517
No good will come of it.

699
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,477
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

700
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,731
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

701
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:54,361
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

702
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,700
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

703
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,036
So be it.

704
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,872
Will you build it?

705
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,418
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

706
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,962
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

707
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,465
This will take some time.

708
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,366
I thought you'd gone.

709
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,494
I don't really have anywhere to go.

710
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,623
You've been sleeping here?

711
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,211
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

712
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,588
Research.

713
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:59,218
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions...

714
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,137
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

715
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,098
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

716
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,934
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two...

717
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,477
Even?

718
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,605
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

719
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,650
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

720
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,570
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

721
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,781
And look at... Look at me, all right?

722
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,826
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

723
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,454
You're going to need a better disguise.

724
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,639
Need a volunteer.

What happened?

726
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,520
Did you hurt him?

727
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,440
What happened, Robert?

728
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,277
You, sir.

729
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,822
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

730
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,491
Just a rubber ball, no.

731
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,828
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

732
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,037
It's magic.

733
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,832
He had a new trick.

734
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,722
OLIVIA:
Was it good?

735
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,271
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

(SPARSE CLAPPING)

737
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,862
ANGIER:
Did they applaud when you saw it?

738
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,072
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

739
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,326
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

740
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,037
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

741
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,414
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell...

742
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,208
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

743
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,002
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

744
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,546
You only say that because
you don't know the method.

745
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,882
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

746
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,218
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

747
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,887
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

748
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,515
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

749
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,766
It's the same man.

750
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,394
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

751
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,438
...but if you look closely you can tell.

752
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,860
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

753
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,363
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

754
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,657
Yes.

755
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,077
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

756
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,413
- Find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

757
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,917
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either...

758
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:40,462
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

759
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,422
...or you listen to how I would do it.

760
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:47,469
The only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

761
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,055
All right.

762
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,809
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

That is for you.

- You caught me in a wrong mood.

to change my mind, aren't I?

soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

789
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,685
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

790
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,687
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

791
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,690
...but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

792
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,360
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

to tell the difference.

01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,754
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

848
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,133
At least he got to see it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

849
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,760
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

850
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,596
They care about the one
who comes out.

851
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,599
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

852
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,102
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

853
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,438
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

854
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,274
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

855
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,485
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

856
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,947
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

857
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,950
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

858
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,621
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

859
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,290
Anyone could walk in here
at any minute.

860
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,459
Congratulations, all.

861
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,213
Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie. We worked hard.

862
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,964
We need to celebrate properly.

863
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,179
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

864
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,598
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

865
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,976
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

866
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,980
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

867
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,815
I need to know how he does it.

868
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,361
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

869
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,490
I need you to go and work for him.

870
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,787
Work for him? Are you joking?

871
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,206
You'll be my spy.

872
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,458
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

873
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,669
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

874
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,464
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

875
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:43,468
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

876
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,011
He knows I work for you.

877
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,473
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

878
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,686
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

879
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,107
Hm?

880
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,074
Good girl.

881
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,831
You must be curious to see what so
much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

882
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,334
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

883
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,211
Your hat.

884
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,555

I don't understand.

Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

888
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,165
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

889
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,875
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,127
- Come back... Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

sometimes.

- Yeah, we make do.

- My name is Olivia Wenscombe...
- I know who you are.

895

You here to steal my show?

896
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,727
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:19,064
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

OLIVIA: I've left Angier.
- All right.

901
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,449
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

902
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,619
- I know you've no reason to trust me...
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

903
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:36,623
I mean, you're only the mistress of
my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

904
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,126
- Mr. Borden...
- Alfred.

905
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,130
I'm going to tell you the truth.

906
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,467
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

907
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:48,927
...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

908
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,640
I am here because he sent me here.

909
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,267
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

910
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,103
What does he need my secret for?

911
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,646
His trick is top-notch.

912
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,483
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

913
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:07,487
...mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

914
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,322
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

915
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:14,619
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

916
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:15,829
No, it's killing him.

917
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,997
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

918
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,374
He thinks of nothing else.

919
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,627
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

920
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,212
There is no future with him.

921
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:30,051
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

922
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:34,139
This is the truth, is it?

923
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,353
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

924
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,730
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

925
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,525
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

926
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,196
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

927
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,406
We have a problem.

928
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,159
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

929
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,953
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

930
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,040
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

931
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,209
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

932
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,211
I was surprised, to tell the truth.

933
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,547
It usually takes them longer
to figure it out.

934
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,508
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

935
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,053
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

936
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,389
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

937
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,893
...where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

938
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,644
Not magician, mind you.

939
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,397
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

940
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,858
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

941
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,235
...to get away
with professional embarrassment.

942
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,614
We don't do any tricks
we can't control.

943
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,618
Just pay him
whatever he wants for now.

944
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:40,205
We keep doing the trick until Borden
opens and then we'll phase it out.

945
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,749
All right.

946
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,422
ANGIER: Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.

of this rather welcome pint of ale?

- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Shh, shh, shh.

949
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:01,059
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

950
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,102
ANGIER: We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...

951
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,438
...so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.

952
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,149
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

do not be alarmed...

is considered safe.

955
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,616
And who are you?

956
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:21,704
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

957
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,957
Hm. Very good.

958
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,135
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

959
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,221
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

960
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,139
Well, I'm only doing one show...

961
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,476
...but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

to know your methods or anything...

01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:59,867
...but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

Oh. I see. Very good.

968
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,123
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

969
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:10,670
What I didn't count on, was that when
I incorporated this bloke into my act...

970
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,839
...he had complete power over me.

971
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,633
Complete power, you say.

- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,346
All the time, Olivia!

1014
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,849
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

1015
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,351
He lives his act! Don't you see?

1016
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,690
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

1017
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,193
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

1018
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:24,030
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

1019
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,201
You stole it?

1020
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,161
I borrowed it for tonight.

1021
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,288
I thought you could translate it,
but now...

1022
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,539
ANGIER: I can't.
- You can't?

1023
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,542
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

1024
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,629
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

1025
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,049
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

1026
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,634
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

1027
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,720
If I don't get that back to him
tomorrow, he'll know I took it.

1028
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,056
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

1029
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,392
This is his diary, Olivia.

1030
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,229
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

1031
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,439
Won't bring your wife back.

1032
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:01,776
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

1033
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,415
Look...

1034
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,585
...I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

1035
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,923
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

1036
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,883
Understand?

1037
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,018
Robert.

1038
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:40,648
I have fallen in love with him.

1039
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,360
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

1040
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:53,953
Notebook?

1041
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,708
Then he's just getting started.

01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,540
I'm walking tonight.
Let him come. I don't care.

1058
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,149
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

1059
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,818
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

1060
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,155
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

1061
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,656
Risk.

1062
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,074
Sacrifice.

1063
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,287
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be
yours, unless you give me what I want.

1064
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,790
- Which is?
- Your secret.

1065
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,209
My secret?

1066
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,628
Your method for The Transported Man.

1067
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,423
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

1068
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,841
You have my notebook.

1069
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,968
Useless without the keyword.

1070
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,096
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

1071
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,140
Describe it in full.

1072
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,822
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

1073
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,366
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

1074
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,827
The keyword is the method.

1075
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,791
Where's my ingénieur?

1076
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,509
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

1077
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,056
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

1078
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,018
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

1079
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,897
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

1080
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,858
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

1081
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,528
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1082
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,531
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

1083
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,075
It's just that you want
something more.

1084
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,827
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

1085
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:09,667
What does it mean?

1086
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,841
(LAUGHS)

1087
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,010
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

1088
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,888
- To America.
- Robert?

1089
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,224
Listen to me.

1090
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:29,520
Obsession is a young man's game.

1091
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:33,607
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

1092
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,569
I can't. I'm sorry.

1093
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,408
Then the rest is up to me.

1094
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,120
I'm sorry.

1095
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,753
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1096
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,547
Champagne, your finest.

1097
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,675
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

1098
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:02,761
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
SARAH: Miss Wenscombe.

1099
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,890
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

1100
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,475
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

1101
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,562
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1102
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:15,983
I am going to bury myself alive
every night...

1103
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,945
...and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1104
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,991
- I think my husband's had quite enough.
- Pour the champagne. Come on, pour...

1105
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,911
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1106
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,038
- Perhaps it would...
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1107
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:32,291
...you might escort Miss Wenscombe
home. My husband's being a bore.

1108
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:36,003
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1109
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:43,010
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1110
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,974
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

1111
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:53,395
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1112
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:57,399
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1113
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,111
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1114
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,988
All right? And I'm out in public.

1115
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,283
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1116
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,203
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1117
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,999
I thought that something
very precious...

1118
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,085
...had been lost to me.

1119
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,338
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1120
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,799
All right, what?

1121
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,676
What did you lose?

1122
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,640
I see, more secrets.

1123
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,686
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1124
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,773
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

1125
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,485
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1126
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,220
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

1127
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:13,392
Unexpected guests.
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1128
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,186
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1129
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,230
- No?
- Worse.

1130
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,566
They work for Thomas Edison.

1131
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,361
BORDEN:
Today, a most curious development.

1132
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,574
His assistant came to us
with a proposition.

1133
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,619
Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.

1134
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,539
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1135
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:39,376
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1136
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,422
This is the truth, is it?

1137
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,892
No, that's what he told me
to tell you. The truth...

1138
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,854
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

1139
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:02,399
...like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1140
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,235
I hate him for that.

1141
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:09,406
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1142
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,618
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1143
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,871
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

1144
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,499
...why no one can see yours
are better. You hide this.

1145
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:22,628
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you perform The Transported Man...

1146
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,422
...but this makes you unique.

1147
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,758
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1148
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,010
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1149
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:34,473
I'm sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.

1150
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,975
Yeah, it does.

1151
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,063
So let people know.

1152
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,484
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1153
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,779
BORDEN:
I think she's telling the truth.

1154
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,782
I think we cannot trust her.

1155
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,788
But I love her. I need her.

1156
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:02,167
To open myself
to such a relationship...

1157
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:06,171
...to the dangers of such an affair...

1158
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:11,051
...I need assurances of fidelity.
Of love.

1159
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,679
But how to be sure?

1160
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:20,310
I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.

1161
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,146
How could he send you away?

1162
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:27,025
BORDEN:
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1163
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,618
Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.

1164
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,037
Not to me, you understand.

1165
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,248
I've been convinced
since she led me to Root.

1166
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:47,212
Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.

1167
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,256
Yes, Angier.

1168
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,717
She gave you this notebook
at my request.

1169
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:57,055
And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.

1170
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:01,768
Did you really think I'd part with
my secret so easily after so much?

1171
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,187
Goodbye, Angier.

1172
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:07,441
May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.

1173
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,244
Tesla!

1174
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:25,125
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1175
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,711
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1176
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:30,589
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

1177

your funding had been cut off.

to stave off ruin.

- Where?

your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1187
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,703
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1188

...is not an exact science.

1189
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,416
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1190
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,835
It requires further examination.

01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,630

- Nowhere.

So the machine was working.

1207
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,579
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

What an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

1345
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:05,028
You said you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

Because she was a part of your life.

And now she's gone.

she said she wanted to meet me.

That she had something
to tell me about you.

You wanna know the truth about me?

1373
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:51,592

- Yes, yes. Part of me.

01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,226
Here.

1511
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,396
That's what you're after.

1512
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:54,690
That's what this is about.

1513
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:56,108
Take it.

1514
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:58,235
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1515
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:03,615
You always were the better magician.

1516
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,284
We both know that.

1517
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,953
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

1518
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,204
(RIPPING PAPER)

1519
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:10,414
...mine is better.

1520
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:15,544
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier, no. Jess, Jess, Jess.

1521
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:19,089
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1522
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:21,758
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

1523
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:27,097
I promise.

1524
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:30,934
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
ANGIER: Come on.

1525
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:34,271
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

1526
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,773
Angier. Angier!

1527
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,942
What, you think this place
can hold me?

1528
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:41,987
Angier! They're gonna
bloody hang me!

1529
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:45,282
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1530
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:47,534
- Listen! Listen! That man...!
GUARD: Just shut up.

1531
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,120
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1532
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,247
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1533
01:51:52,414 --> 01:51:54,333
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
GUARD: Guards!

1534
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:56,668
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

1535
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,837
ANGIER: Goodbye, Professor.
- Angier!

1536
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,302
Run along now.

1537
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:09,765
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1538
01:52:25,614 --> 01:52:26,657
CUTTER:
Dear God.

1539
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:29,117
Hello, Cutter.

1540
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:31,620
You're... You're still alive.

1541
01:52:31,787 --> 01:52:33,538
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1542
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:36,083
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1543
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,129
HOUSEKEEPER: Child.
JESS: Good night, sir.

1544
01:52:41,296 --> 01:52:42,798
ANGIER:
Good night, Jess.

1545
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,093
CUTTER:
I've seen her before.

1546
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:51,556
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1547
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,936
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

1548
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:58,355
She needs her father.

1549
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:01,525
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1550
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:07,572
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1551
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:11,368
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1552
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:14,788
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1553
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:20,210
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1554
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,630
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1555
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,173
My theater.

1556
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,467
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1557
01:53:28,093 --> 01:53:30,595
John, I tried not to involve you.

1558
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:45,444
So...

1559
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:49,865
...we go alone now.

1560
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:52,409
Both of us.

1561
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:59,249
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

1562
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,173
No.

1563
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:10,677
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1564
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,972
I'm sorry.

1565
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:18,143
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1566
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,438
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1567
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:24,816
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1568
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:26,943
I didn't.

1569
01:54:28,487 --> 01:54:31,198
You go live your life
in full now, all right?

1570
01:54:31,365 --> 01:54:32,908
You live for both of us.

1571
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,168
Goodbye.

1572
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:31,258
Are you watching closely?

1573
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:04,708
Put it down the end.

1574
01:56:38,283 --> 01:56:42,454
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1575
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:48,001
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1576
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:50,253
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1577
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:56,218
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1578
01:57:34,965 --> 01:57:36,925
WARDEN:
Alfred Borden...

1579
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:41,054
...this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England...

1580
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:43,473
...you will meet your end.

1581
01:57:45,141 --> 01:57:48,061
No one cares about
the man in the box.

1582
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:53,775
Cutter?

1583
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:00,073
Cutter?

1584
01:58:01,866 --> 01:58:05,287
WARDEN:
Do you have anything to say?

1585
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:10,292
Abracadabra.

1586
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:18,383
(GUNSHOT)

1587
01:58:22,262 --> 01:58:23,722
(GRUNTING)

1588
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,663
A brother.

1589
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:50,165
A twin.

1590
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:56,630
You were Fallon the whole time.

1591
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:57,922
No.

1592
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:02,552
We were both Fallon.
And we were both Borden.

1593
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:11,645
Were you...? Were you the one
who went into the box...

1594
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:13,605
...or the one who came back out?

1595
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:16,983
We took turns.

1596
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,865
The trick is where we would swap.

1597
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:31,706
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1598
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:34,626
But I told him
it was too simple, too easy.

1599
01:59:35,794 --> 01:59:37,420
No.

1600
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,048
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1601
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:43,968
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1602
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:49,557
Ah!

1603
01:59:49,724 --> 01:59:51,810
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1604
01:59:56,815 --> 01:59:58,983
What about Olivia? And your wife?

1605
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:01,903
We each loved one of them.

1606
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,617
I loved Sarah.

1607
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:10,912
He loved Olivia.

1608
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:16,501
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1609
02:00:16,668 --> 02:00:18,461
Just.

1610
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:22,048
But not for them.

1611
02:00:24,676 --> 02:00:29,389
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1612
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:34,644
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1613
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:39,441
I've made sacrifices.

1614
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:41,359
- No.
- Yes.

1615
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:44,946
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1616
02:00:46,156 --> 02:00:47,741
It takes everything.

1617
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,971
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the...!

1618
02:01:10,138 --> 02:01:11,765
(GUNSHOT)

1619
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:19,147
It took courage.

1620
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:24,486
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

1621
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:30,283
...not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

1622
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:34,204
...or in the Prestige.

1623
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:40,668
Do you wanna...?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1624
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:44,255
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1625
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:47,050
Look. Look.

1626
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:50,178
I don't care.

1627
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:57,101
You went halfway around the world.

1628
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:01,064
You spent a fortune.

1629
02:02:02,899 --> 02:02:05,235
You did terrible things.

1630
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:09,239
Really terrible things, Robert.

1631
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,408
And all for nothing.

1632
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:16,371
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

1633
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:24,504
You never understood why we did this.

1634
02:02:27,423 --> 02:02:30,677
The audience knows the truth.

1635
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:35,265
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1636
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,561
Solid all the way through.

1637
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:46,067
But if you could fool them,
even for a second...

1638
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:50,321
...then you could make them wonder.

1639
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:52,991
And then you...

1640
02:02:53,449 --> 02:02:57,912
Then you got to see something
very special.

1641
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,043
You really don't know?

1642
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:13,011
It was... It was the look on their faces.

1643
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,515
(GASPS)

1644
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:33,197
CUTTER: Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.

1645
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:39,704
The first part is called the Pledge.

1646
02:03:40,121 --> 02:03:42,790
The magician shows you
something ordinary.

1647
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:47,670
The second act is called the Turn.

1648
02:03:47,921 --> 02:03:51,007
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

1649
02:03:51,174 --> 02:03:54,135
...and makes it into
something extraordinary.

1650
02:03:55,428 --> 02:03:57,180
But you wouldn't clap yet...

1651
02:03:57,347 --> 02:04:00,433
...because making something
disappear isn't enough.

1652
02:04:01,059 --> 02:04:04,562
You have to bring it back.

1653
02:04:08,316 --> 02:04:09,984
Hey.

1654
02:04:37,971 --> 02:04:41,057
CUTTER:
Now you're looking for the secret.

1655
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:48,231
But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.

1656
02:04:50,233 --> 02:04:53,319
You don't really want to work it out.

1657
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:58,700
You want to be fooled.
