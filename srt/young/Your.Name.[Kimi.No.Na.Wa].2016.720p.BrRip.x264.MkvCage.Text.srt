1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074

2
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,974
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,811
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

4
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,483
<i>The dream I must have had
I can never recall.</i>

5
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:06,984
<i>But...</i>

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,486
<i>But...</i>

7
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,822
<i>the sensation that I've lost something</i>

8
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,618
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

9
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,503
<i>I'm always searching</i>

10
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,005
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

11
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:33,385
<i>This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...</i>

12
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:37,807
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

13
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,767
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

14
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>as if a scene from a dream.</i>

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

16
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,526
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

17
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:53,030
<i>Ah, if only our voices speak at night</i>

18
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:59,537
<i>could ever reach the very edge of this world,
and the time</i>

19
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>Instead of fading into air and dust</i>

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:10,381
<i>Then what will the words could ever be?
farthest words from 'probably'</i>

21
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:16,762
<i>Let's make a promise, that will never fade
Let's say it together in count of three, oh</i>

22
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,693
<i>Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish
will be heard</i>

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>But lately I lost sight of the truth in those words</i>

24
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:38,450
<i>I can't even remember when I gave up believing
What could have been the reason?</i>

25
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:44,123
<i>Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop
And the place rainbow born and dies</i>

26
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,292
<i>And where the end of this life lies</i>

27
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:50,462
<i>I've always been insisting
there was something that I've longing for</i>

28
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:59,763
<i>One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented</i>

29
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,435
<i>We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time</i>

30
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:10,149
<i>The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you, dear</i>

31
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,153
<i>Let's make a sign for when we say
"nice to meet you" again</i>

32
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,408
<i>I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name</i>

33
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

34
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,274
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

35
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,528
My name is...

36
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:58,948
Mitsuha!

37
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,444
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

38
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,990
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

39
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,951
What? "Mitsuha"?

40
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,662
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

41
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,831
Hurry up!

42
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,185
What? What?

43
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,448
Do you want last night's leftovers?

44
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,991
You can have it.

45
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,828
Mitsuha, you're late!

47
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,122
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

48
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,046
Is this too much?

49
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,714
Oh well.

50
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,632
You're normal today.

51
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,052
You were nuts yesterday.

52
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,304
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,059
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

54
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,730
<i>This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.</i>

55
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,734
<i>Regarding the mayoral election</i>

56
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:03,405
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

57
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:12,373
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

58
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:17,002
<i>The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

59
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,004
Just make it up with him.

60
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,381
It's an adult matter.

61
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,759
<i>"Position of Comet Tiamat"...JAXA are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

62
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,885
<i>...JAXA are preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.</i>

63
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,112
We're going now!

64
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,426
Study hard!

65
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,015
Mitsuha!

66
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,017
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

67
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,060
Morning.

68
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,021
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

69
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,815
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

70
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,109
You two get along so well.

71
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,569
We do not!

72
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,532
Your hair looks all right today.

73
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,700
What?

74
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,537
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

75
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,414
You were totally possessed!

76
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:40,919
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

77
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,755
Huh? What are you talking about?

78
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,048
You don't remember?

79
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,051
And above all,

80
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:53,724
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

81
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,018
Only when these are achieved

82
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,563
can a safe and secure community
be created!

83
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,149
As the incumbent mayor...

84
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,985
He'll be reelected again anyway.

85
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,571
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

86
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,656
Hey, Miyamizu.

87
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,908
Morning.

88
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,870
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

89
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,079
Ew.

90
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,835
Mitsuha!

91
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,713
Stand up straight!

92
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,592
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

93
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,094
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

94
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,597
Mitsuha.

95
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,517
In front of everybody...

96
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,104
"Who are you?"

97
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,914
"Tasokare"

98
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:56,078
"Tasokare" means "Who is that" and is
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

99
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,915
Twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

100
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:05,629
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

101
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,008
Older expressions include
"karetaso-doki"

102
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:16,139
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

103
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,185
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

104
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,022
I've heard that Itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

105
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:27,150
"Who are you?"

106
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,612
OK next, Mitsuha.

107
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,114
Yes.

108
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,159
Oh, so you remember your name today.

109
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,163
You don't remember?

110
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,378
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

111
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,339
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

112
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,469
What? No way! Really?

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
It was like you had amnesia.

114
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:01,351
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

115
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,855
A dream about someone else's life?

116
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,066
I can't remember clearly.

117
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,652
I know! That was...

118
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,987
your previous life!

119
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,116
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

120
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,409
Stay out of this.

121
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,079
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

122
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,166
Nothing.

123
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,879
But Mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

124
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,131
You been feeling alright?

125
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,344
That's so strange. I feel fine.

126
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,306
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

127
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,017
Oh, don't remind me!

128
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,394
I can't stand this town anymore.

129
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:50,692
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

130
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

131
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,368
Trains come every 2 hours.

132
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,411
The store closes at 9 p.m.

133
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,372
No bookstore. No dentist.

134
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,916
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"
But 2 pubs for some reason.

135
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,042
No jobs.

136
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,168
No brides.

137
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,170
Short sunlight hours.

138
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,716
- Give me a break!
- What?

139
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,345
I mean... How about we stop by a café?

140
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,680
- A café?
- Really?

141
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,181
Where?

142
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,561
Hello.

143
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,397
Hello.

144
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,569
This is a café?

145
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,697
You knew there wasn't one.

146
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,366
Mitsuha just went home.

147
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,953
Things must be rough for her.

148
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,414
Well, she takes center stage.

149
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,915
Yeah.

150
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
Hey, Tessie.

151
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,046
What?

152
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,882
What will you do after you graduate?

153
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,760
What's this?
You asking about my future?

154
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:06,059
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

155
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,744
I'd rather do that too.

156
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,496
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

157
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,957
Listen to the thread's voice.

158
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,294
When you keep twining like that,

159
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,631
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

160
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,258
Threads don't talk.

161
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,552
She means, "Concentrate."

162
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:46,349
1,000 years of Itomori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

163
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:50,270
Listen. 200 years ago...

164
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,022
Here she goes again.

165
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:58,779
Sandal maker Mayugoro's bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

166
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,240
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

167
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,950
and this is known as...

168
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,994
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

169
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,956
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

170
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,630
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

171
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,593
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

172
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,097
That's the important task
we at Miyamizu Shrine have.

173
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,813
But that foolish son-in-law...

174
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:38,026
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough,

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,029
now politics? He's hopeless.

176
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,490
Have another, my man.

177
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,912
I'm counting on your help again.

178
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,247
Leave it to me.

179
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,125
You'll get votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.

180
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,544
How's it going with her?

181
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
It's not that easy.

182
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,424
I smell corruption.

183
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,260
Don't be ridiculous.

184
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,929
Bring us a few more hot <i>sake.</i>

185
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,222
OK.

186
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,891
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

187
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,143
Learn how to use explosives.

188
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,271
Can't hear you.

189
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,272
Yes!

190
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,913
We both have it rough, don't we?

191
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,059
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

192
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,812
They're both pretty like their mother.

193
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,565
Hey.

194
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,774
Hey.

195
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,601
It's the oldest <i>sake</i> in the world.

196
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,565
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

197
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,612
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
<i>sake</i> made that way?

198
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,489
Of course they do.

199
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,826
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

200
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,751
Oh! I could never do that!

201
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,544
Isn't she embarrassed?

202
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,421
I can't believe it.

203
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:22,732
Cheer up, Mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

204
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,944
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

205
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,824
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

206
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,451
Where do you get such ideas?

207
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:38,832
Sell them with photos and making videos.
Name it "Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake</i>."

208
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,709
You'll make money!

209
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,795
"Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake</i>"

210
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,548
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

211
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,843
That's the problem?

212
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,104
I hate this town! I hate this life!

213
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,525
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

214
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,698
What a fool...

215
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,560
Ow!

216
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,398
Ouch...

217
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,283
Where...

218
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,588
Something's there...

219
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,478
Ow!

220
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,647
Taki! Are you up?

221
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,152
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

222
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,487
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,325
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

224
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,493
OK.

225
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,455
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

226
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,333
Have a nice day.

227
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,720
What a strange dream.

228
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,350
"From Tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

229
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,355
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

230
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,033
I have to use the bathroom.

231
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,752
This is too realistic.

232
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,096
"Shinjuku Station"

233
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,992
I'm in Tokyo.

234
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,624
"Jingu High School"

235
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,626
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

236
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,628
The front act at the next gig...

237
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,631
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

238
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,637
Taki!

239
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,433
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

240
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,103
You ignored my text.

241
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,980
Oh, Tsukasa?

242
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,899
At least you sound apologetic.

243
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,903
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

244
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,657
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

245
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:26,327
- Uh... Well... I...
- Feminine?

246
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,870
I!

247
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,580
I?

248
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:30,915
I?

249
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:38,840
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

250
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,426
You seem to have a dialect.

251
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,678
Where's your lunch?

252
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,806
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

253
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,018
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

254
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,773
Thank you.

255
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,027
Let's go to a café.

256
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,696
Oh that one? OK. Coming, Taki?

257
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,490
What? What? What?

258
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,284
A café?

259
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,372
Nice timberwork up there.

260
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,666
Yeah, attention to detail.

261
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,335
Taki, have you decided?

262
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,798
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

263
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,634
What age are you from again?

264
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,555
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

265
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,897
What a great dream.

266
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,322
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

267
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,741
Your shift is today?

268
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,910
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

269
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,330
Oh! Um...

270
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,250
Where do I work?

271
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,835
What?

272
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,177
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

273
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,388
Table 12! Taki!

274
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,848
Here you go.

275
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,851
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

276
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,353
We didn't order that.

277
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,855
Taki, I said no more truffles!

278
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,857
Taki, can't hear you!

279
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:20,858
Taki!

280
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,862
When is this dream going to end?

281
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,581
Hey. Hey waiter.

282
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,874
Oh, yes?

283
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,796
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

284
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,383
We could have gotten hurt.

285
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:49,971
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

286
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,140
Uh, well...

287
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,978
But... There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

288
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,064
Excuse me.

289
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,358
Is everything OK?

290
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,402
I'll handle this.

291
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,072
What's wrong with you today?

292
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,660
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

293
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,786
Oh, really?

294
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,038
I hope you weren't hurt.

295
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,341
Um...

296
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,843
Okudera...

297
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,886
Ms. Okudera.

298
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,972
Ms. Okudera. Thank you...

299
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,515
A stroke of bad luck today.

300
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,641
No, uh...

301
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,185
Bet it was a set-up.

302
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,813
Handled it according to the manual, but...

303
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,358
Oh, Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

304
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,694
You OK?

305
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,696
- What happened?
- Slashed.

306
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,698
That dick from earlier?

307
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,242
What now? Do you remember his face?

308
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,619
No.

309
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,454
Come with me.

310
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,372
Hey, Taki!

311
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,042
Take off your skirt.

312
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,503
Oh! I'll look the other way!

313
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,675
This won't take long.

314
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,139
Done!

315
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,894
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

316
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:25,191
Thank you for saving me today.

317
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,404
Actually, I was concerned about you.

318
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,658
You're weak but quick-tempered.

319
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,410
I like you better today.

320
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,748
Never knew you had a feminine side.

321
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,918
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

322
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,012
What a realistic dream
if I say so myself.

323
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,435
Oh, he keeps a diary.

324
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,942
He's so organized.

325
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,695
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

326
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,449
Oh! That's her!

327
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,832
A crush, maybe?

328
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:34,468
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

329
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,305
"Who are you?"

330
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:50,818
"Mitsuha"

331
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,835
What is this?

332
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,337
"Mitsuha"

333
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,842
Wha...? Wha...?

334
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,886
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on?

335
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:17,678
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

336
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,764
Let's go to a café again.

337
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,183
Sorry, I have to go to work.

338
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,185
Do you remember where to go?

339
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,107
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

340
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,694
Oh, never mind. See you.

341
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,490
He's acting normal today.

342
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,326
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

343
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,202
What?

344
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,040
Wha... What?

345
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,417
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

346
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,211
You walked home with her!

347
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,508
Did I really? With Ms. Okudera?

348
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,218
What happened afterwards?

349
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,721
I don't really remember.

350
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,306
Oh really, now?

351
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,892
Coming through.

352
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,728
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

353
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,981
Let's make this a good one.

354
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,234
Right, Taki?

355
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,330
"Mitsuha? Who are you?
What are you?"

356
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,834
You're not touching your boobs today.

357
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,336
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

358
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,133
Boobs?

359
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,344
Morning.

360
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,437
Why is everyone staring at me?

361
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,940
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

362
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:53,607
Huh?

363
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,911
"Still life drawing"

364
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,112
Did you see the election posters?

365
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,532
Doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

366
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,785
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

367
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,122
They mean me, right?

368
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,915
Well, yeah.

369
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,293
Hey, Mitsuha!

370
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:26,974
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

371
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,686
Mitsuha?

372
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,446
Is this... Could this be...

373
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,367
Could this be that we're really...

374
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,870
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

375
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,790
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

376
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,459
switching places?

377
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,080
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

378
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,333
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

379
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,545
<i>I switch with Mitsuha at random,</i>

380
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,588
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

381
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,551
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

382
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:43,926
"Condition: Sleep?
Cause: Unknown"

383
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:48,764
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

384
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,268
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

385
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,272
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...</i>

386
00:30:56,397 --> 00:31:01,110
<i>So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

387
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,954
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

388
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,282
<i>Things to watch out during the switch
and a list of "don'ts."</i>

389
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,333
"Don't waste money! No dialect!
Don't be late!"

390
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,327
<i>We also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.</i>

391
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,457
<i>To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

392
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,418
<i>But...</i>

393
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,961
<i>But...</i>

394
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,714
- That girl!
- That guy!

395
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:40,900
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

396
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,905
<i>Stop wasting my money!</i>

397
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,824
<i>It's YOUR body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

398
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,042
"Braided cords..."

399
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:50,993
<i>Braided cords... I can't do this!</i>

400
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,953
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

401
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,622
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

402
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:19,313
<i>Grabbed' coffee with Ms. Okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

403
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,858
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

404
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,362
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

405
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,406
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

406
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,368
<i>Don't be full of yourself!
Not like YOU have a girlfriend!</i>

407
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,661
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

408
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,537
"Fool/Idiot" <i>- I...
- I...</i>

409
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,581
I'm single because I want to be!

410
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,313
I shouldn't for her sake.

411
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,653
You sure do like your boobs.

412
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,155
We're going now! Get ready!

413
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,371
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

414
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,164
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

415
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:24,970
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

416
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:25,713
<i>Comet Tiamat is moving from east to west
as if to follow the sun.</i>

417
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,715
<i>So it can be seen above Venus...</i>

418
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,675
Why the uniform?

419
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:42,646
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away?

420
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,275
I don't know because of Mayugoro.

421
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,735
Who's that?

422
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,194
What? He's famous!

423
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,747
Here, Grandma.

424
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,712
Whoa, Mitsuha.

425
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,727
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?

426
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,270
Musubi?

427
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:28,525
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

428
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,737
This word has profound meaning.

429
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:37,701
Tying thread is Musubi.
Connecting people is Musubi.

430
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,245
The flow of time is Musubi.

431
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,624
These are all the god's power.

432
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,377
So the braided cords that we make

433
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:52,925
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

434
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,261
They converge and take shape.

435
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,514
They twist, tangle

436
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:03,143
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

437
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,773
<i>Musubi</i> - knotting. That's time.

438
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,319
Drink.

439
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:13,779
Thank you.

440
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,906
I want some too!

441
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,283
That's also Musubi.

442
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,329
Whether it be water, rice, or <i>sake,</i>

443
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:27,793
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

444
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,462
So today's offering

445
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,301
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

446
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,847
Hey, I see it!

447
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:47,187
That's the body
of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

448
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,583
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

449
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,544
It means the underworld.

450
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,046
It's the underworld!

451
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,846
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

452
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,223
what is most important to you.

453
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,102
The kuchikamisake.

454
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,605
The kuchikamisake?

455
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:33,609
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

456
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:37,404
It's half of you.

457
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,325
<i>Half of Mitsuha...</i>

458
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,303
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.

459
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,388
Kataware-doki?

460
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,816
Oh yeah,

461
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,777
maybe I can see the comet.

462
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,780
The comet?

463
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,406
Oh,

464
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,408
Mitsuha,

465
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,912
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

466
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,801
Tears? Why?

467
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,430
"I'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

468
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,434
Ms. Okudera? What's she talking about?

469
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,646
What did Mitsuha do this time?

470
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,440
A date?

471
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,993
<i>A date with Ms. Okudera tomorrow!</i>

472
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,453
<i>Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!</i>

473
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,458
...was what I'd planned, but...

474
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,473
Taki.

475
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,560
Sorry. Did you wait long?

476
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,228
Yes. No...

477
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,439
Um...

478
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,198
I just got here.

479
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,492
Good. Let's go.

480
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:53,081
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

481
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:57,961
Hey?

482
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,508
I...

483
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,719
Why?

484
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,519
<i>I wanted to go on this date,</i>

485
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:20,025
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

486
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:29,034
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before,</i>

487
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,080
I don't know what to say...

488
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:37,501
<i>so below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

489
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:38,919
Really?

490
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,295
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

491
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,801
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting."

492
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,303
She's making fun of me.

493
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,307
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

494
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,333
Taki...

495
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,796
You're like a different person today.

496
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,352
Um, Ms. Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

497
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,814
Let's call it a day.

498
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,650
Yes.

499
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:47,320
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

500
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,367
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

501
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,872
But now you like someone else.

502
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,500
No I don't!

503
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,418
Really?

504
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,879
No! That's not true at all.

505
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,964
I wonder.

506
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

507
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:30,655
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

508
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,369
What is she saying?

509
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:43,168
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

510
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,192
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

511
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:13,740
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

512
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:18,119
What? The festival? Well...

513
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:24,167
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

514
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,712
OK, got it. Later, then.

515
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,093
You just want to see her in a <i>yukata</i>.

516
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,178
What I? No!

517
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,305
That didn't even occur to me.

518
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,434
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

519
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,562
Maybe you annoyed her.

520
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,771
Come on!

521
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:45,814
Sorry I'm late.

522
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,357
- Here she is!
- Finally!

523
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,779
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

524
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,073
Your hair!

525
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,910
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

526
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,964
You think some guy is the reason?
Ditched, maybe?

527
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,925
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

528
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,428
She said she just felt like it.

529
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,973
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

530
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

531
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,538
Wow!

532
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:07,103
<i>The number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned off...</i>

533
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:15,362
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,</i>

534
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,239
<i>I thought. But...</i>

535
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,117
<i>For some reason, after that,</i>

536
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:25,997
<i>Mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

537
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,035
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

538
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,464
"Hida mountains"

539
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:23,573
What the... What are you doing here?

540
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,953
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

541
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:38,087
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

542
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,464
Takagi will cover your shift.

543
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,717
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

544
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:44,844
This isn't funny.

545
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,263
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

546
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,517
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

547
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,768
A con act?

548
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,062
You're meeting an online friend.

549
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,523
Well no, not exactly...

550
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,858
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

551
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,446
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

552
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,240
I'm not a kid!

553
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:12,080
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

554
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,751
<i>So I decided to go see Mitsuha
in person.</i>

555
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:20,004
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

556
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,554
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

557
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,513
Yes.

558
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,894
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

559
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,730
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

560
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,065
I did not plan a tour!

561
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,527
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

562
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,697
Oh how cute! Look!

563
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:46,865
So annoying.

564
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,033
Oh, it moved!

565
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,188
So it's impossible after all...

566
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:23,067
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

567
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,239
You haven't done anything.

568
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,036
A Takayama ramen.

569
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,579
A Takayama ramen.

570
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,414
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

571
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,626
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

572
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,172
Can we return to Tokyo today?

573
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,467
We could be cutting it close.
I'll check.

574
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,343
Thanks.

575
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,803
Are you all right with that?

576
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:57,685
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

577
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,443
Why young man,
that's Itomori, isn't it?

578
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,989
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

579
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:15,161
Yeah, it's Itomori.
Brings back memories.

580
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,497
He was born in Itomori.

581
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,082
Itomori...?

582
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:25,588
Yes! Itomori Town! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

583
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,508
- What are you...
- Itomori was...

584
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,511
Itomori? No way!

585
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,305
Is it where that comet...?

586
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,274
"Keep Out"

587
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,899
Hey. Is this really the place?

588
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,903
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

589
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,699
No. I'm sure this is it.

590
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:40,413
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

591
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,331
That can't be true!

592
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:47,712
Surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

593
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,839
Died?

594
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,343
Died 3 years ago?

595
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,597
That can't be.

596
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:02,185
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

597
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,204
They're disappearing...

598
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,758
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

599
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,394
"Itomori,
the Town that Vanished"

600
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,637
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

601
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:41,724
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town" Nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

602
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,977
"Town Annihilated"

603
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,729
"Over 500 dead or missing"

604
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,231
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

605
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:53,236
A fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Japan.

606
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,039
"Itomori, comet, damage"

607
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,492
It was the day of the autumn festival.

608
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,869
The point of impact was here.

609
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:08,251
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

610
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:13,556
"List of the Names of Victims"

611
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,758
Over 500 people died,
a third of the town's population,

612
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,512
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

613
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,274
Tessie and Sayaka...

614
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,280
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

615
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:42,618
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

616
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:48,916
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible.

617
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,042
So...

618
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,836
<i>You 're dreaming now...</i>

619
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:53,296
I...

620
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,298
<i>...aren't you?</i>

621
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,383
I...

622
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,720
What did I...?

623
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,736
Lively up there.

624
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,447
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

625
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,823
No problem.

626
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,034
How's Taki?

627
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,454
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

628
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,832
Newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems.

629
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,257
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

630
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,053
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

631
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:45,264
What do you think about Taki's story?

632
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,937
I liked him.

633
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:57,401
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

634
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:01,739
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

635
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:06,869
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

636
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:14,794
But I'm sure he met someone
and that someone changed him.

637
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,265
That much is for sure, I think.

638
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:19,757
"Worst-ever
Itomori Comet Disaster"

639
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,897
It was all just a dream.

640
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:42,571
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

641
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,659
If not that, then... a ghost?

642
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,914
No... Was I fantasizing?

643
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,255
Her name... What was it?

644
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,427
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

645
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,431
Oh, Ms.Okudera. I, uh...

646
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:14,437
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

647
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,942
No problem.

648
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,652
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

649
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,762
"Braided Cords of Itomori"

650
00:55:23,962 --> 00:55:25,948
Braided cords. How pretty.

651
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,869
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

652
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,958
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

653
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,254
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

654
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,966
Who was it?

655
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:49,221
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

656
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,265
Yes...No.

657
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:58,731
Someone who makes braided cords
told me before...

658
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:01,942
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

659
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:08,074
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

660
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,286
Maybe at that place...

661
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,138
"Around here?"

662
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,021

<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

666
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,798
"I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

667
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,553
Taki...

668
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,328
Eat this up there.

669
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,333
Your drawing of Itomori... It was good.

<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,</i>

671
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,379
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

672
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:32,885
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

673
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,647
There it is!

674
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,317
It's really there!

675
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,321
It wasn't just a dream!

676
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,854
From here is the underworld.

677
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,839
It's the <i>sake</i> we brought.

678
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,468
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

679
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:05,894
Before the comet struck... So the
Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

680
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,899
Our timelines weren't in step.

681
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,112
Half of her...

682
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:30,836
Musubi.

683
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,049
If time can really be turned back,

684
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,302
give me one last chance...

685
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,734
The comet!

686
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:02,094
Your name is Mitsuha.

687
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,728
You're both my treasures.

688
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,272
You're a big sister now.

689
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,858
"Get well soon, Mom."

690
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,527
I'm so sorry, my dears.

691
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:23,657
Dad, when is Mom going to come home?

692
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,993
I couldn't save her.

693
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,036
Get a hold of yourself!

694
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,413
Who cares about the shrine?

695
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,206
You're the adopted son-in-law!

696
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,418
I loved my wife Futaba.
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

697
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,003
Get out of here!

698
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,966
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

699
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:44,636
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

700
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:50,350
"Who are you?"
Who am I? No, who are you?

701
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,643
Who am I? No, who are you?

702
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,528
"Fool"

703
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:55,230
Don't be full of yourself.
Not like YOU have a girlfriend.

704
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,984
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

705
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,445
I...

706
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,821
I'm going to Tokyo.

707
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,031
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

708
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,662
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

709
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,124
Oh yeah, the comet.

710
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,836
Today's the peak of its brightness...

711
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,963
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

712
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:25,511
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

713
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,015
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there!</i>

714
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,143
<i>Mitsuha! Mitsuha!</i>

715
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,354
<i>Mitsuha!</i>

716
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:56,667
I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

717
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,429
Mitsuha, are you touching...

718
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,101
My sister!

719
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:18,355
Yotsuha!

720
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,777
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

721
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,446
I'm leaving without her.

722
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,032
She's lost it.

723
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,702
She's completely lost it.

724
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,161
Scary.

725
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:37,666
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

726
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,628
<i>Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,</i>

727
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,381
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

728
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,384
It's tonight. There's still time.

729
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,761
Good morning, Mitsuha.

730
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:51,597
Oh...

731
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,309
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

732
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:59,605
You knew, Grandma?

733
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:06,153
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

734
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:12,659
I also remember seeing strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

735
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:19,708
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

736
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:21,585
Forgotten...

737
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:26,673
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

738
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:31,678
There were times your mother and I
had similar experiences.

739
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:36,391
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

740
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,145
were all for what will happen today.

741
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,689
Grandma, listen.

742
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:48,070
A comet will strike Itomori tonight
and everyone will die.

743
01:05:55,327 --> 01:06:00,666
<i>"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, Grandma.</i>

744
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,502
I won't let them die!

745
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:07,172
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

746
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:11,593
Your... your hair!

747
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,262
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

748
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:15,847
Oh, that's it?

749
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:20,143
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

750
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:24,564
So we have to act!

751
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,071
Why aren't you at school?

752
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:35,909
Uh... We have to save the town.

753
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:38,704
The community wireless system?

754
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,331
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

755
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,835
"Superimposition, frequency"

756
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,881
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

757
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,509
Hey! Don't come so close!

758
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,720
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

759
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,889
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

760
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,851
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

761
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:02,519
You're such a nice guy!

762
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,400
Got them. Here's your change.

763
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,818
Sorry, Sayaka.

764
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,319
It's all right.

765
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,864
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

766
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:19,828
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

767
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:25,542
What? A bomb?

768
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:30,213
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

769
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,715
Broadcast hijacking?

770
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:37,054
The town's wireless system can be easily
jacked using the startup frequency.

771
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:40,640
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

772
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:45,937
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

773
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,232
It's... It's totally a crime!

774
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,901
You do the broadcast.

775
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:53,612
- Why?
- You're in the broadcast club.

776
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:55,405
I'm in charge of explosives.

777
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,616
I'll go talk to the mayor.

778
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:01,995
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

779
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

780
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,417
It's a perfect plan.

781
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:13,173
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it?

782
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,634
What? Well...

783
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:19,679
Not necessarily! Do you know
how Lake Itomori was formed?

784
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:23,483
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

785
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,769
It's a meteor crater! So one did strike
this area a thousand years ago!

786
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,437
Oh! So that's why...

787
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:29,815
You're right, Tessie!

788
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,445
Let's do it together!

789
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,952
What on earth are you talking about?

790
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,666
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

791
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,959
Shut your mouth.

792
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,968
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

793
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:00,971
"Itomori Town Hall"

794
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,974
How dare you spout such nonsense?

795
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,561
If you're serious, then you're sick.

796
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,981
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

797
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,611
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

798
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,824
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

799
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:25,579
You son of a...!

800
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,924
Mitsuha! No...

801
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,051
Who...

802
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,180
Who are you?

803
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,404
See you later at the festival.

804
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,281
Let's meet at the shrine.

805
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,449
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

806
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:04,117
- See you.
- Later.

807
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:07,120
You shouldn't go!

808
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,123
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

809
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,499
What are you saying?

810
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:12,626
Mitsuha!

811
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,086
- What was that?
- Let's go.

812
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,589
What are you doing?

813
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,883
Could Mitsuha...

814
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,637
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

815
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,891
Yotsuha, leave town with Grandma
before nightfall.

816
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,935
You'll die if you stay here!

817
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,978
What are you saying?

818
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:36,524
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

819
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,611
Tokyo?

820
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,572
Hey, Mitsuha!

821
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,910
How did it go with your old man?

822
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,705
Hey, Mitsuha?

823
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,540
What's wrong with her?

824
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:53,792
No idea.

825
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:05,512
Are you there?

826
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,932
Is something over there?

827
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,600
Let me use your bike.

828
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:11,726
Hey, what the...

829
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,061
Hey, Mitsuha!

830
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:15,647
What about our plan?

831
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,649
Get ready as planned!

832
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,693
Please!

833
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,179
I'm Taki again.

834
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,519
What's Taki doing here?

835
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,321
The town...

836
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,656
is gone.

837
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:19,878
At that moment... did I...

838
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,841
die?

839
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,228
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

840
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,733
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

841
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,331
I'm going to Tokyo.

842
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,749
What? Now?

843
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,250
Why?

844
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:00,752
A date.

845
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,088
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

846
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,131
Not my date.

847
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,426
I'll come home tonight.

848
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:16,267
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

849
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,978
<i>He might not like it.</i>

850
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,824
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

851
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,909
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

852
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,286
<i>But what if we did?</i>

853
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,291
<i>What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

854
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,294
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

855
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,215
<i>he'd be a bit glad to see me?</i>

856
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:52,303
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

857
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,223
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

858
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,892
<i>But...</i>

859
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,813
<i>...one thing is certain.</i>

860
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,651
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

861
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,738
<i>That you were the one who was inside me.</i>

862
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,659
<i>That I was the one who was inside you.</i>

863
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,494
I'm sorry.

864
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,860
Excuse me.

865
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:25,396
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I got to know you...</i>

866
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,401
Taki.

867
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,904
Taki.

868
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:35,990
Taki.

869
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:39,160
Um... It's me.

870
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,748
Don't you remember me?

871
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,417
Who are you?

872
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:52,590
I'm sorry.

873
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,933
<i>But he's Taki.</i>

874
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,936
<i>Weird girl.</i>

875
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:14,821
Hey!

876
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,323
What's your name?

877
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:18,992
Mitsuha!

878
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,953
My name is Mitsuha!

879
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:34,215
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

880
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,426
<i>to see me!</i>

881
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:48,646
Taki?

882
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,073
Mitsuha!

883
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:01,618
Taki?

884
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,800
Mitsuha!

885
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:21,804
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

886
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:23,973
Taki!

887
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,476
Taki, where are you?

888
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,519
It's Mitsuha.

889
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,772
I can hear her, but...

890
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,859
Taki, where are you?

891
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:35,943
Taki!

892
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,376
Taki, are you...

893
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,170
there?

894
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:20,863
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

895
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,879
Mitsuha.

896
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:44,554
Taki.

897
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,350
Taki. It's really you.

898
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,605
Taki!

899
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,899
I came to see you.

900
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:01,237
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

901
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:06,117
But how? At that moment, I...

902
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,661
I drank your kuchikamisake.

903
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:14,625
You drank that?

904
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,128
You idiot! Pervert!

905
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,215
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

906
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,301
How do you know that?

907
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,052
Yotsuha saw it.

908
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,890
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

909
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,433
Just once?

910
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,395
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

911
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,439
Sorry.

912
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,941
Oh, this...

913
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:43,446
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

914
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,782
There's no way I'd recognize you.

915
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:49,327
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

916
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:51,913
Now you keep it.

917
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,957
Yes.

918
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,175
How is it?

919
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:06,469
Not bad.

920
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,012
You're lying!

921
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,473
No, I... Sorry.

922
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,017
You're really so...!

923
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:29,492
Mitsuha, you still have
things to do. Listen.

924
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:33,579
It's coming.

925
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:36,624
Don't worry. You've still got time.

926
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,584
Yes, I'll try.

927
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,047
Kataware-doki is almost...

928
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,674
over.

929
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,555
Hey, Mitsuha. So we don't forget
when we wake up...

930
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,688
Let's write our names
on each other. Here.

931
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,232
OK!

932
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:11,909
Mitsuha?

933
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:16,038
Hey, Mitsuha?

934
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,841
I wanted to tell you.

935
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:33,639
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll search for you.

936
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,562
Your name is Mitsuha.

937
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:43,316
It's OK. I remember.

938
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:47,612
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.
Your name is Mitsuha.

939
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:49,238
Your name is...

940
01:21:59,624 --> 01:22:02,627
Who are you?

941
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,715
Why did I come here?

942
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,761
I came here to see her.

943
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:15,598
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

944
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:20,019
Who was it? Who?
Who did I come to see?

945
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:25,399
Someone dear to me. I don't want
to forget. I shouldn't forget!

946
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:31,530
Who? Who? Who? Who?

947
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,616
What's your name?

948
01:22:48,506 --> 01:22:51,676
<i>Taki. Taki. Taki.</i>

949
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:55,513
<i>It's OK. I remember. I'll never forget!</i>

950
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,307
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

951
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:01,644
<i>Your name is Taki!</i>

Tessie!

954
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,371
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

955
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,373
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

956
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,001
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

957
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:29,338
Explain everything to me later.

958
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:36,012
That's going to fall? Really?

959
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,180
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

960
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:40,975
What? You saw it, huh?

961
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,188
Then I guess we got no choice.
Now we're both criminals!

"Broadcasting Room"

963
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:50,901
What? I really have to do it?

964
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:57,408
When the town's power goes out, the
equipment there should work on backup.

965
01:23:57,742 --> 01:24:00,828
Please, Sayaka!
Repeat it as much as you can!

966
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,497
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

967
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:07,043
Oh, to heck with it!

968
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,218
- Soon, you think?
- I've no idea!

969
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,147
- What was that?
- What's that sound?

970
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:29,607
Hey, look!

971
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,218
Hey, look!

972
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:10,272
<i>This is Itomori Town Hall.</i>

973
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:14,485
<i>An explosion has occurred
at the substation.</i>

974
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:18,781

evacuate to Itomori High School.</i>

Who is it, then?

978
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,881
<i>Miyamori District...</i>

01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,265
Tessie!

982
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:53,399
Run, everyone! Forest fire!

983
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,860
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

984
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:57,695
Run! Fire!

985
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,823
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

986
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:04,326
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

987
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,663
What's wrong?

988
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:12,168
His name... I can't remember his name.

989
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:18,215
Look, I don't know.
You started all this!

990
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,052
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!

991
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,763
Go persuade your father!

992
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,317
Everyone run! Go to the high school!

993
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:40,196
Oh, Mitsuha.

994
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:46,952
It's no terrorist attack!
What's Chubu Electric saying?

995
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,579
They're still checking!

996
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:52,082
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

997
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,209
OK!

998
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:58,422
Stop this broadcast!
Figure out where it's coming from!

999
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:01,217
The Takayama sensor station called!

1000
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,719

evacuate to Itomori High School...Oh!</i>

Oh no.

1005
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:23,614
What have you done, Sayaka!

1006
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:29,703
<i>This is Itomori Town Hall.</i>

<i>Please don't panic and stay
where you are for further notice.</i>

1009
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,340
Stay put, they said.

1010
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:44,301
- What's going on?
- So we stay put?

1011
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:50,432
Come on, you should all evacuate!
The high school is the shelter!

1012
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,934
Katsuhiko!

1013
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:56,897
What are you doing?

1014
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:02,111
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1015
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,822
It's over.

1016
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:10,828
It's really splitting apart!

1017
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,003
- Look at that!
- Wow!

1018
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,839
<i>Please look! The comet has split in two</i>

1019
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:23,757
<i>and meteors are falling!</i>

1020
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,593
<i>Nobody predicted this.</i>

1021
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,345
<i>We have a mystical view here.</i>

1022
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,431
<i>So the comet's nucleus split?</i>

1023
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:31,849
<i>Did tidal forces affect...</i>

1024
01:28:32,016 --> 01:28:36,854
<i>The comet isn't within the Roche limit
so the nucleus itself must have...</i>

1025
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:42,234
<i>In the past, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.</i>

1026
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:43,610
<i>At least 21 fragments...</i>

1027
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:45,863
I'm going to go look!

1028
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,867
<i>They will probably melt
before reaching the ground</i>

1029
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,371
<i>and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small...</i>

1030
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,123
<i>To predict the trajectory...</i>

1031
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,585
<i>To be witnessing such a magnificent
celestial event, and...</i>

1032
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,463
<i>That we're witnessing this live</i>

1033
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:07,176
<i>is extremely fortunate
for those of us living in this age.</i>

1034
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,473
<i>Hey. Who are you?</i>

1035
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,479
<i>Who? Who?</i>

1036
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,898
<i>Who is that?</i>

1037
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:25,652
<i>Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.
I didn't want to forget!</i>

1038
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:30,824
<i>Who? Who? Who are you?</i>

1039
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,911
<i>What's your name?</i>

1040
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:42,002
It's broken!

1041
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:06,485
<i>So we don't forget when we wake up,
let's write our names on each other.</i>

1042
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:18,455
"I love you"

1043
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:38,016
I can't remember your name with this...

1044
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:52,906
Dad!

1045
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,201
- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

1046
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:58,745
Not you again...

1047
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:06,420
<i>It was almost as if it were
a scene from a dream.</i>

1048
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,799
<i>Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.</i>

1049
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:48,105
What am I doing here?

1050
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,473
<i>I'm always searching for something.</i>

1051
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:28,103
<i>This feeling has possessed me
for some time.</i>

1052
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,065
I applied because...

1053
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,567
The landscapes people live in...

1054
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:35,569
To build a city's landscape...

1055
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:39,865
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

1056
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:46,079
So I want to help build landscapes that
leave heartwarming memories...

1057
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,375
How many interviews have you had?

1058
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,585
I haven't kept track.

1059
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:54,046
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot!

1060
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:55,589
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1061
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:57,591
We're not that different!
