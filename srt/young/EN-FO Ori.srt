1
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,935
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,980
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,441
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
My son...

5
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,542
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,717
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,678
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,973
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,770
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,272
He never speaks.

11
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,733
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,905
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,658
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,746
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,632
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,596
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,516
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,938
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,407
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,911
Run, Vito!

21
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,876
Kill him!

22
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,765
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,352
You understand?

24
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,616
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,728
Vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,112
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

27
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,032
...turn him over to us.

28
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,535
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,831
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,556
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,470
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

32
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,722
I know, I know.

33
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,084
Your family's still called Corleone.

34
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,339
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

35
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,426
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

36
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,595
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

37
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,764
...with Hyman Roth!

38
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:36,662
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

39
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,257
Cicci, the door...

40
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,889
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

41
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,747
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

42
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:22,010
I left Naples. I left Mama.

43
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,180
For a no-good tramp!

44
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:31,519
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

45
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,983
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

46
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,154
Without news from home.

47
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,165
Finally, a letter from Naples!

48
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,046
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

49
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,924
She's very beautiful.

50
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:06,429
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

51
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,015
Our dear mother -

52
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,353
...is dead!

53
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,912
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

54
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,336
Sit down, you bum!

55
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,094
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

56
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,271
We'll go see her backstage.

57
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,817
Who was that?

58
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,362
The Black Hand.

59
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,355
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

60
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,816
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

61
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,028
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

62
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,697
You'll pay me today!

63
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,668
Let's go.

64
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,090
Not my daughter! Let her go!

65
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,677
Here, take all my money!

66
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,072
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

67
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,076
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

68
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,537
Even my father, in the grocery store.

69
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,038
If he's Italian...

70
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,543
...why does he bother other Italians?

71
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,045
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

72
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,298
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

73
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,258
If you're happy, I'm happy.

74
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,350
Don't you feel well?

75
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,231
Is your boss treating you all right?

76
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,984
Forget it.

77
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,007
Hide this for me!

78
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,677
Next week I'll come and get it!

79
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,677
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

80
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,684
How's business?

81
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,900
It's good, it's good.

82
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,952
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

83
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,123
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

84
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,542
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

85
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,675
So Fanucci's changing?

86
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,553
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

87
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,723
Even from my father.

88
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,810
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

89
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,178
I've got some bad news.

90
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,935
I feel rotten about telling you this...

91
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,775
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

92
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,410
And you have to give him myjob.

93
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,664
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

94
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,000
You looked after me like a father.

95
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,877
I thank you.

96
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,464
And I won't forget it.

97
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,197
Take this to your family.

98
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,910
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

99
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,072
What a nice pear!

100
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,098
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

101
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,229
Did you look inside?

102
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,608
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

103
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:36,249
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

104
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,801
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

105
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,348
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

106
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,610
My wife would like it.

107
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,554
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

108
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,435
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

109
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,191
Well, he won't mind.

110
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,024
This is your friend's place?

111
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,695
This is a real palace.

112
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,906
One of the best.

113
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,539
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

114
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,034
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

115
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,870
Michael Corleone is here.

116
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,208
He's in your den. You better hurry.

117
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,961
He's been waiting a half hour.

118
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,345
Is something wrong?

119
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:08,654
It's nothing.

120
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,116
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

121
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:37,734
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

122
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:54,871
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

123
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,124
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

124
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:04,672
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

125
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:08,551
And I shall leave the city immediately.

126
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:15,809
I wish all of you good luck.

127
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:22,865
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

128
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:11,956
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

129
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:16,085
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

130
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,713
You know I've got three daughters.

131
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,840
This is my neighborhood.

132
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:25,094
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

133
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,932
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

134
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:35,938
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

135
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:41,110
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

136
01:51:41,486 --> 01:51:46,574
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

137
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,287
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

138
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,290
And your family will be ruined.

139
01:51:55,459 --> 01:52:00,796
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

140
01:52:01,465 --> 01:52:05,468
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

141
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:07,637
Now don't refuse me.

142
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:11,307
Understand, paisan?

143
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:19,273
I understand.

144
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:26,364
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

145
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:32,119
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

146
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:38,626
Don't be afraid to tell them!

147
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,797
600 bucks...

148
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,341
Suppose we don't pay?

149
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:49,971
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

150
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:54,141
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

151
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:58,521
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

152
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:01,190
$200 each... everybody agreed?

153
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:07,196
Why do we have to pay him?

154
01:53:07,823 --> 01:53:10,116
Vito, leave this to us.

155
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:14,203
He's one person, we're three.

156
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,164
He's got guns, we've got guns.

157
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:21,043
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

158
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:23,504
This is his neighborhood!

159
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:29,719
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

160
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:37,727
They don't pay Fanucci.

161
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:44,400
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

162
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,572
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

163
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:07,923
Now what I say stays in this room.

164
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:12,970
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

165
01:54:16,141 --> 01:54:19,477
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

166
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,440
If Fanucci says $200...

167
01:54:24,524 --> 01:54:25,941
...he means it, Vito!

168
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:29,403
I'll reason with him.

169
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:33,532
Leave everything to me.

170
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,456
I never lie to my friends.

171
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,210
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

172
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,088
He'll ask for the money.

173
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:52,635
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

174
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,472
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

175
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:01,477
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

176
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:04,814
How can you get him to take less?

177
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,691
That's my business.

178
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:11,404
Just remember that I did you a favor.

179
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:17,410
Is it a deal?

180
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,753
His family's out of the house.

181
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,423
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

182
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,695
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

183
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:20,157
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.

184
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:34,213
I was right.

185
01:57:35,632 --> 01:57:37,424
Only $ 100...

186
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:43,055
I'm short of money right now.

187
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:49,520
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

188
01:57:50,397 --> 01:57:52,606
You understand, don't you?

189
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:03,450
You've got balls, young man!

190
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:08,497
How come I never heard
of you before?

191
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:17,423
You've got a lot of guts.

192
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:24,346
I'll find you some work
for good money.

193
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:39,987
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

194
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:45,200
You've done well for yourself.

195
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:51,206
Enjoy the festa!

196
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,838
Oh, this is too violent for me!

197
02:03:24,856 --> 02:03:26,315
What've you got there?

198
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:08,935
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

199
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:43,978
Tell me something, Ma.

200
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:51,778
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

201
02:11:58,369 --> 02:12:00,245
He was being strong...

202
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:08,336
Strong for his family.

203
02:12:18,139 --> 02:12:20,807
But by being strong for his family...

204
02:12:22,309 --> 02:12:24,144
...could he...

205
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,355
...lose it?

206
02:12:29,316 --> 02:12:34,696
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

207
02:12:36,532 --> 02:12:39,826
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

208
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:43,371
No, I meant... lose his family.

209
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:51,212
But you can never lose your family.

210
02:13:00,723 --> 02:13:02,557
Times are changing.

211
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,540
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

212
02:13:28,334 --> 02:13:30,043
Take it as a gift.

213
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:56,653
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

214
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:03,117
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

215
02:14:05,788 --> 02:14:07,789
She's in bad trouble.

216
02:14:08,457 --> 02:14:12,460
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

217
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:16,172
He told her to get rid of the animal.

218
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:21,970
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

219
02:14:22,596 --> 02:14:26,391
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

220
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:32,105
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

221
02:14:32,773 --> 02:14:34,440
I'm so ashamed!

222
02:14:34,817 --> 02:14:39,279
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

223
02:14:42,116 --> 02:14:43,700
I'm sorry, but...

224
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:49,163
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

225
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:51,457
I can't move!

226
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:54,752
I want you to talk to him!

227
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:58,006
Tell him I want to stay here!

228
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:07,390
What's your landlord's name?

229
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:09,892
His name is Signor Roberto.

230
02:15:10,477 --> 02:15:12,895
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

231
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,441
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

232
02:15:17,526 --> 02:15:19,068
A real pig-sty, eh?

233
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:42,133
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

234
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:46,346
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

235
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:51,142
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

236
02:15:51,393 --> 02:15:55,438
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

237
02:15:55,814 --> 02:15:59,442
I already rented the place
to another family.

238
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:09,619
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

239
02:16:10,871 --> 02:16:14,749
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

240
02:16:15,292 --> 02:16:17,251
So let her stay.

241
02:16:19,797 --> 02:16:21,130
Are you Sicilian?

242
02:16:21,548 --> 02:16:23,216
No, I'm Calabrese.

243
02:16:23,884 --> 02:16:27,178
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

244
02:16:27,763 --> 02:16:30,431
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

245
02:16:31,433 --> 02:16:33,726
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

246
02:16:34,269 --> 02:16:36,688
How much more a month?

247
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:38,898
Five bucks.

248
02:16:43,779 --> 02:16:46,823
Here's six months increase in advance.

249
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,785
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

250
02:16:51,245 --> 02:16:53,830
Come see me in another six months.

251
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:58,292
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

252
02:16:59,086 --> 02:17:00,211
The dog stays.

253
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,136
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

254
02:17:08,512 --> 02:17:12,557
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

255
02:17:15,018 --> 02:17:16,769
Do me this favor.

256
02:17:17,646 --> 02:17:19,731
I won't forget it.

257
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:23,860
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

258
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:27,655
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

259
02:17:34,496 --> 02:17:36,414
What a character!

260
02:17:44,339 --> 02:17:49,260
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

261
02:17:56,852 --> 02:18:00,188
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

262
02:18:08,197 --> 02:18:10,990
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

263
02:18:12,117 --> 02:18:14,368
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

264
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,331
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

265
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:22,585
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

266
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:31,719
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

267
02:18:40,062 --> 02:18:44,816
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

268
02:18:53,408 --> 02:18:55,159
Can I sit down?

269
02:18:58,205 --> 02:19:01,207
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

270
02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:16,305
I'll even lower it.

271
02:19:19,142 --> 02:19:20,434
I'll lower it $5.

272
02:19:24,773 --> 02:19:26,315
I'll lower it $ 10!

273
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:34,866
Can I offer you some coffee?

274
02:19:37,244 --> 02:19:41,873
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

275
02:19:47,296 --> 02:19:49,755
You'll have to excuse me for now.

276
02:19:55,137 --> 02:19:57,263
I wish I could stay longer!

277
02:20:03,228 --> 02:20:05,646
Just call me and I'll be here!

278
02:20:16,658 --> 02:20:19,493
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

279
02:47:52,312 --> 02:47:54,313
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

280
02:47:58,235 --> 02:48:01,279
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

281
02:48:01,613 --> 02:48:04,448
My partner in America, in New York.

282
02:48:05,117 --> 02:48:06,951
His name is Vito Corleone.

283
02:48:07,661 --> 02:48:10,204
We'll send him olive oil from here.

284
02:48:10,998 --> 02:48:12,456
To his company in America.

285
02:48:17,254 --> 02:48:20,548
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

286
02:48:30,267 --> 02:48:35,855
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

287
02:48:36,982 --> 02:48:39,859
Where is this young man
from New York?

288
02:48:43,196 --> 02:48:46,365
Have him come closer.

289
02:48:47,367 --> 02:48:50,202
I can't see him so good.

290
02:48:57,210 --> 02:49:00,880
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

291
02:49:03,383 --> 02:49:05,092
Bless you!

292
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:08,554
What's your name?

293
02:49:13,977 --> 02:49:17,146
You took the name of this town!

294
02:49:17,689 --> 02:49:19,440
And what's your father's name?

295
02:49:19,566 --> 02:49:23,235
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

296
02:49:23,612 --> 02:49:27,239
Louder, I don't hear so good.

297
02:49:30,702 --> 02:49:33,913
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

298
02:49:34,247 --> 02:49:36,957
...and this is for you!

299
03:00:26,983 --> 03:00:28,650
So... you're staying?

300
03:00:30,695 --> 03:00:33,030
Yes, I'm staying.
