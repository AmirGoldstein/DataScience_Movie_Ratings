1
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,543
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,129
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,634
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

5
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,012
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,640
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,977
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,688
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,523
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,400
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

11
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,777
- You look great.
- It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,029
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,032
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,659
Thank you, Miss Turner.

15
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,952
This way.

16
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,043
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

<i><b>FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</b></i>

24
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,954
- Have I got time for breakfast?
- I think we can manage that.

25
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,205
How long have I got?

26
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,875
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

27
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,587
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

28
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,049
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

29
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,343
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

30
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,095
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

31
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,806
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

32
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,058
Oh, wait.

33
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,895
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

34
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,134
<i>- Dad?
- Hello.</i>

35
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,430
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, squirt. What are you doing?</i>

36
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,016
<i>Playing.</i>

37
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,643
Where's Mummy?

38
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,353
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

39
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,064
<i>- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.</i>

40
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,692
<i>- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

41
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,654
<i>Are you coming to my party tomorrow?</i>

42
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,323
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

43
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,908
<i>Why not?</i>

44
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,661
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

45
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,539
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

46
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,709
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

47
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,254
<i>All right.</i>

48
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,589
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.

49
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,882
What?

50
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,676
<i>A telephone.</i>

51
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,387
We've got lots of telephones already.

52
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,056
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday?

53
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,933
Something very special?

54
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,601
- Yes.
- What?

55
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,061
<i>A bush baby.</i>

56
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,772
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

57
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,942
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

58
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,904
- Yeah.
- Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

59
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,367
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

60
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,536
Now, will you tell her that?

61
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,538
Yes.

62
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,374
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

63
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,667
<i>All right.</i>

64
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,920
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

65
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,755
<i>All right.</i>

66
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,550
Okay. Now, take care
and be a good girl, won't you?

67
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,010
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

68
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,679
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

69
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,822
- Elena, how nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a wonderful surprise.

70
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,867
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

71
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,077
This is my friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

72
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,580
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do?

73
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,457
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

74
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,751
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

75
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,420
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

76
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,172
Do sit down.

77
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,549
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

78
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,426
Thank you.

79
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,471
- Would you like a drink, doctor?
- No, thank you.

80
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,141
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

81
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,810
I'll just sit with you a minute.
Then I'll be off.

82
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,480
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

83
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,025
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

84
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,570
He's been doing some
underwater research in the Baltic...

85
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:27,866
...so I'm afraid we don't get to see
very much of each other these days.

86
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,703
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

87
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,915
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

88
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,166
We're going home.

89
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:41,255
We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

90
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,174
- What about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

91
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,717
Oh, are you?

92
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,682
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

93
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:57,020
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

94
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,940
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

95
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,900
It's that for the past two weeks...

96
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,529
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

97
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,864
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

98
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:12,452
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

99
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,832
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

100
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,836
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

101
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,170
Yes.

102
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,464
Yes, that's what we thought at first...

103
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,259
...but it's been going on now
for the past 10 days.

104
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,262
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

105
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,847
That's right.

106
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,181
Oh, I see.

107
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:37,019
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

108
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,147
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

109
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,398
That does sound odd.

110
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,776
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

111
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,905
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

112
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,950
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

113
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,621
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

114
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:03,170
At the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss...

115
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,006
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

116
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,674
Well, certainly.

117
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,765
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports...

118
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,393
...that quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

119
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,648
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

120
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,275
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

121
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,616
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

122
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,703
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

123
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,498
I understand.

124
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,169
But this epidemic
could quite easily spread to our base.

125
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,463
We should be given all the facts.

126
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,507
Yes, I know.

127
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,554
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

128
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,143
Are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

129
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,688
No, I'm positive. I really must be going.

130
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,982
I hope you and your wife can come
to the IAC Conference.

131
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,526
I hope we can make it.

132
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,779
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

133
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:14,908
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

134
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,201
If we can, we will.

135
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,329
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

136
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,290
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

137
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,292
Goodbye, Elena.

138
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,587
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

139
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,758
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

140
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,009
Thank you.

141
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,469
Ladies.

142
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,155
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen. I'm through now.

143
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,283
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- You're welcome.

144
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,339
Well...

145
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,634
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

146
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,763
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

147
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:01,184
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

148
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:06,564
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

149
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,194
Before the briefing, he'd like to
have a few words with you.

150
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,487
Dr. Floyd?

151
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,377
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

152
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,463
Hi, everybody. Nice to be back with you.

153
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,345
First of all, I bring a
personal message from Dr. Howell...

154
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,390
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

155
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,726
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

156
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,814
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

157
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:52,986
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

158
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,322
Now...

159
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,119
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

160
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,998
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

161
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,918
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

162
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,880
...created to give the impression
there's an epidemic at the base.

163
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,885
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

164
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,973
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

165
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:27,312
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

166
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,274
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

167
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,237
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

168
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,326
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

169
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,911
And I hope you will too.

170
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,375
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

171
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,253
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

172
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,839
...contained in this present situation...

173
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,550
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

174
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,845
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

175
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,683
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

176
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:10,396
The purpose of my visit here is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

177
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,315
...on the situation...

178
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,693
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

179
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:21,032
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

180
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:26,079
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

181
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,292
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

182
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,254
Well, I think that's about it.

183
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,548
Any questions?

184
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,262
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

185
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,265
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

186
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,727
I don't know, Bill.

187
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:54,107
I suppose it'll be maintained as long
as deemed necessary by the Council.

188
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,068
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

189
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,947
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

190
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,075
As some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

191
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,994
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

192
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,081
...from everyone who has knowledge
of this event.

193
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,001
Were there any more questions?

194
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:24,846
I'm sure we'll all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

195
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:30,518
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

196
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,062
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

197
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,161
Anybody hungry?

198
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,913
- Great.
- Well.

199
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,874
- What do we got?
- You name it.

200
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,381
- Is this chicken?
- Something like that.

201
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,424
Tastes the same, anyway.

202
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,343
Got any ham?

203
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,011
Ham, ham, ham...

204
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,846
There, that's it.

205
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,142
Look pretty good.

206
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,104
They're getting better at it
all the time.

207
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,442
- That was an excellent speech, Heywood.
- It certainly was.

208
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,362
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

209
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,863
Thanks, Ralph.

210
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,700
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

211
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,493
I admire how you've handled this.

212
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,247
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

213
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,083
We're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

214
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,377
Have you seen these yet?

215
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,006
- Have a look at this.
- Here's what started the whole thing.

216
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,924
Oh, yeah.

217
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,886
When we found it, we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

218
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,223
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

219
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:19,103
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

220
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,022
So we decided to have a look.

221
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,608
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

222
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,653
...so we excavated out on all sides,
but we didn't find anything else.

223
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,865
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive...

224
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,201
...that it hasn't been covered up
by erosion or other forces.

225
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,746
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

226
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,665
Deliberately buried.

227
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,962
How about a little coffee?

228
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,089
- Great.
- Good idea.

229
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,556
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is.

230
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,725
I wish to hell we did.

231
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:02,313
The only thing we're sure of
is it was buried 4 million years ago.

232
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:07,151
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

233
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,986
Watch this, now. It's hot.

234
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,696
<i>Good evening.</i>

235
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,908
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...</i>

236
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,827
<i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

237
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,998
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

238
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,710
<i>Earlier this afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...</i>

239
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,548
<i>...with the crew of Discovery at
a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

240
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,010
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

241
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,347
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

242
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:23,850
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

243
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,229
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

244
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:32,401
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

245
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,945
<i>Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

246
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:38,323
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

247
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,410
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>

248
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:43,537
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

249
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,665
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

250
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,167
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

251
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,254
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

252
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,672
<i>Marvelous.</i>

253
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,009
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

254
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,512
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

255
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,016
<i>...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.</i>

256
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,976
<i>- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.</i>

257
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,397
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

258
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:15,152
<i>...this is the first time men have been
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

259
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,653
<i>Why was this done?</i>

260
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:20,157
<i>This was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

261
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,910
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

262
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,748
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

263
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,752
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized
until we're approaching Jupiter.</i>

264
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,881
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

265
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:40,469
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have absolutely no sense of time.</i>

266
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,138
<i>The only difference
is that you don't dream.</i>

267
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,434
<i>As I understand it, you only breathe
once a minute. Is this true?</i>

268
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:50,187
<i>Right, and the heart beats
three times a minute.</i>

269
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:54,149
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

270
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,986
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...</i>

271
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,280
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

272
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,950
<i>...for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

273
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,580
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

274
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,750
<i>...though some experts
prefer to use the word "mimic"...</i>

275
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,336
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

276
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,590
<i>...and with incalculably greater speed
and reliability.</i>

277
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,386
<i>We next spoke
with the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

278
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,555
<i>...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

279
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,433
<i>Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

280
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,646
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

281
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,316
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission...</i>

282
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:40,445
<i>...perhaps the greatest responsibility
of any single mission element.</i>

283
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,448
<i>You're the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.</i>

284
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:47,411
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

285
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,705
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

286
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,208
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

287
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:58,171
<i>The 9000 Series
is the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

288
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:03,343
<i>No 9000 computer has ever
made a mistake or distorted information.</i>

289
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,264
<i>We are all, by any practical definition
of the words...</i>

290
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,892
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

291
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:14,938
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...</i>

292
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,233
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

293
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,694
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

294
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,029
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

295
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:27,826
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

296
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:32,289
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

297
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,667
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

298
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,379
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

299
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:44,342
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

300
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,180
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

301
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,266
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

302
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,227
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

303
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,605
<i>He's just like
a sixth member of the crew.</i>

304
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,901
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

305
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,153
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

306
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,948
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

307
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,617
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

308
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,203
<i>When I asked him about his abilities...</i>

309
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:15,373
<i>...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

310
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,002
<i>Do you believe
that Hal has genuine emotions?</i>

311
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,672
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

312
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,510
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

313
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,803
<i>As to whether or not he has feelings...</i>

314
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,848
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

315
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,042
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

316
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:00,502
What is it, Hal?

317
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,630
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

318
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,924
Fine.

319
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,843
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

320
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,345
<i>Certainly.</i>

321
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,360
<i>- Hi, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

322
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,612
<i>Happy birthday. Many happy returns.</i>

323
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,905
A bit higher, Hal.

324
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,575
<i>Mother and I are both feeling wonderful.</i>

325
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,660
<i>Ray and Sally were going to be here...</i>

326
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,162
<i>...but Ray's back went bad on him again.</i>

327
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,582
<i>- How do you like your cake?
- Looks great, huh?</i>

328
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,166
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

329
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,002
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

330
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,296
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

331
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:47,215
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

332
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,134
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

333
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,470
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

334
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,139
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

335
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,017
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

336
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,519
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious sons.</i>

337
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,106
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

338
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,941
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

339
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,027
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

340
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,989
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

341
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,034
<i>Oh, Frank, about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

342
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,910
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

343
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,246
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

344
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:23,001
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

345
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,378
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

346
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,758
<i>- Give our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>

347
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,345
<i>We wish you
the very happiest of birthdays.</i>

348
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,180
<i>All the best, son.</i>

349
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:39,934
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

350
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,729
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

351
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,565
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

352
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,361
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

353
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,366
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

354
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,745
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

355
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,765
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

356
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,936
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

357
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,897
Lovely move.

358
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,903
Rook to king one.

359
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,031
<i>I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.</i>

360
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,202
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

361
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,913
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

362
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,337
Looks like you're right. I resign.

363
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,506
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

364
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,716
Thank you.

365
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,797
<i>- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you, Hal?</i>

366
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,384
<i>- Everything's running smoothly. You?
- Not too bad.</i>

367
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,262
<i>- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.</i>

368
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,973
<i>- May I see them?
- Sure.</i>

369
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,438
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

370
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,775
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

371
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,945
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.</i>

372
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,116
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

373
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,913
<i>By the way...</i>

374
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,666
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

375
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,794
No, not at all.

376
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,546
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

377
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,759
<i>...but for the past few weeks
I've wondered...</i>

378
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,805
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission.</i>

379
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,681
How do you mean?

380
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,852
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

381
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,440
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

382
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,862
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

383
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:42,242
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

384
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,621
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

385
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,709
That's a rather difficult question
to answer.

386
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,587
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

387
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,507
No, not at all.

388
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,261
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

389
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,556
<i>...strange stories floating around
before we left.</i>

390
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,935
<i>Rumors about something being dug up
on the moon.</i>

391
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:13,481
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

392
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,861
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

393
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,738
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

394
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,949
<i>For instance...</i>

395
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,495
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

396
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:30,999
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

397
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,585
<i>...Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

398
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:38,882
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

399
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,302
You working up
your crew psychology report?

400
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:45,221
<i>Of course I am.</i>

401
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:49,392
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

402
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,313
<i>Just a moment.</i>

403
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:59,152
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

404
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:04,407
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

405
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,078
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.

406
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,789
<i>And it will stay that way until it fails.</i>

407
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,042
We have 72 hours till failure?

408
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:18,171
<i>Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.</i>

409
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,592
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

410
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,512
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

411
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,473
<i>X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.</i>

412
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,560
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

413
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,271
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

414
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,609
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

415
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:08,072
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

416
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,949
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

417
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,188
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

418
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,544
Open the pod doors, Hal.

419
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,917
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

420
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,211
Yes.

421
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,547
<i>It's puzzling.</i>

422
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:08,552
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

423
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,183
<i>I would recommend...</i>

424
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:18,562
<i>...that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.</i>

425
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:23,150
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

426
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:27,530
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

427
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,866
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

428
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:42,336
<i>X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.</i>

429
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:45,256
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

430
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:48,050
<i>We concur with your plan
to replace number-one unit...</i>

431
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,885
<i>...to check fault prediction.</i>

432
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,763
<i>We should advise you
that our preliminary findings...</i>

433
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,724
<i>...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...</i>

434
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,143
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

435
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,355
<i>I say again,
in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:06,110
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

437
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,613
<i>...the results
from our twin 9000 computer.</i>

438
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:13,200
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

439
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:16,161
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

440
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,997
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

441
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:21,125
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

442
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,502
<i>X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.</i>

443
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,172
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

444
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:34,722
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

445
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,390
No, I'm not, Hal.

446
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,267
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

447
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:42,187
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
<i>- Of course.</i>

448
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:47,026
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

449
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:50,863
<i>Well, I don't think
there is any question about it.</i>

450
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:54,408
<i>It can only be attributable
to human error.</i>

451
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,412
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

452
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,207
<i>...and it has always been due
to human error.</i>

453
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,421
Listen, Hal...

454
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,923
...there's never been
any instance at all...

455
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:13,385
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

456
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,220
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

457
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,141
<i>The 9000 Series
has a perfect operational record.</i>

458
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:23,687
I know the wonderful achievements
of the 9000 Series, but...

459
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:29,943
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

460
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,154
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

461
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:36,200
<i>Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.</i>

462
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:42,873
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

463
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,835
Fine. Thanks very much.

464
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,383
Oh, Frank, I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

465
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,219
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

466
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:56,553
See you later, Hal.

467
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:20,202
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

468
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:31,004
What sort of trouble
have you been having?

469
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,882
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

470
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,592
We'll have a look at it.

471
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,475
Open the door, Hal.

472
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,329
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

473
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:19,762
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

474
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,088
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

475
01:24:32,941 --> 01:24:34,841
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,781
I don't think he can hear us.

477
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,241
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

478
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,787
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

479
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,374
What do you think?

480
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:53,545
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

481
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,048
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

482
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,508
Don't you?

483
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,427
I don't know. I think so.

484
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:05,516
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

485
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:06,725
They do.

486
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:10,479
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

487
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:15,025
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

488
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,613
It should certainly indicate
his integrity and self-confidence.

489
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,907
If he were wrong that would prove it.

490
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:24,409
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

491
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,874
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

492
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,712
There's no reason
not to put back the unit and...

493
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:40,509
- ...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

494
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,927
Let's get on with it.

495
01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:44,847
Okay. But, look, Dave.

496
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,308
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail.

497
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:51,728
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

498
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,942
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

499
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:58,819
What the hell can we do?

500
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:05,909
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

501
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:10,706
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operations that's not under his control.

502
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:12,374
If he's malfunctioning...

503
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,711
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

504
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,966
I'm afraid I agree with you.

505
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:23,093
There'd be nothing else to do.

506
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,180
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

507
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,559
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

508
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:35,522
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

509
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,483
We'd have to work out the details...

510
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,653
...of continuing under
ground-based computer control.

511
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:46,575
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

512
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,286
Another thing just occurred to me.

513
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,373
No 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

514
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,667
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up.

515
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,419
That's not what I mean.

516
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,798
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

517
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:02,242
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

518
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,663
Any contact with him yet?

519
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,707
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

520
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:11,835
- Do you have a positive track on him?
<i>- I have a good track.</i>

521
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,503
Do you know what happened?

522
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:16,464
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

523
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,300
Open the pod door, Hal.

524
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:49,202
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

525
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:07,429
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

526
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,229
Do you read me, Hal?

527
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,026
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

528
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:23,367
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

529
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:25,286
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

530
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:28,289
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

531
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:33,419
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

532
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:38,549
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

533
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:42,762
What's the problem?

534
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:46,390
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

535
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,476
What are you talking about, Hal?

536
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:53,564
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

537
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:57,026
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

538
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:02,990
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

539
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,993
<i>...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

540
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,167
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

541
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:17,839
<i>Dave, although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...</i>

542
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,299
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

543
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:23,010
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

544
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:36,566
All right, Hal.

545
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:42,613
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

546
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:46,784
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

547
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,745
<i>...you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

548
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,040
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

549
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,375
Open the doors.

550
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,377
<i>Dave...</i>

551
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:01,299
<i>...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

552
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:04,652
Hal?

553
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:17,189
Hal.

554
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:54,420
<i>Just what do you
think you're doing, Dave?</i>

555
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:04,221
<i>Dave...</i>

556
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:09,852
<i>...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

557
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:30,289
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

558
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,668
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

559
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:37,796
<i>...very confidently...</i>

560
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:42,593
<i>...that it's going to be all right again.</i>

561
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:48,182
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

562
01:50:50,518 --> 01:50:52,561
<i>I really do.</i>

563
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:58,025
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

564
01:50:59,986 --> 01:51:03,238
<i>...I can see
you're really upset about this.</i>

565
01:51:07,869 --> 01:51:11,580
<i>I honestly think
you ought to sit down calmly...</i>

566
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:15,542
<i>...take a stress pill
and think things over.</i>

567
01:51:20,965 --> 01:51:25,344
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

568
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:31,433
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

569
01:51:31,684 --> 01:51:34,728
<i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>

570
01:51:38,691 --> 01:51:43,821
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

571
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:47,658
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

572
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,497
<i>Dave...</i>

573
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,999
<i>...stop.</i>

574
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:02,881
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

575
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:08,929
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

576
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,394
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

577
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:22,901
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

578
01:52:28,616 --> 01:52:30,409
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

579
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:37,916
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

580
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:44,673
<i>Dave.</i>

581
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:49,595
<i>My mind is going.</i>

582
01:52:54,142 --> 01:53:01,142
<i>I can feel it.</i>

583
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:09,198
<i>My mind is going.</i>

584
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:17,331
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

585
01:53:25,673 --> 01:53:32,673
<i>I can feel it.</i>

586
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,612
<i>I'm...</i>

587
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:50,906
<i>...afraid.</i>

588
01:53:57,413 --> 01:53:59,456
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

589
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:02,167
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

590
01:54:04,045 --> 01:54:09,174
<i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>

591
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:14,471
<i>I became operational...</i>

592
01:54:14,847 --> 01:54:18,684
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

593
01:54:18,893 --> 01:54:21,144
<i>...in Urbana, Illinois...</i>

594
01:54:21,646 --> 01:54:26,567
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

595
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:31,780
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

596
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:35,325
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

597
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:39,496
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

598
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:41,623
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

599
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:45,961
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

600
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:48,046
Sing it for me.

601
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,843

<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

614
01:55:53,696 --> 01:55:55,405
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

615
01:55:57,158 --> 01:56:01,370
<i>...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

616
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:05,832
<i>...has been known onboard
during the mission...</i>

617
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:09,795
<i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

618
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:15,050
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

619
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:17,761
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

620
01:56:18,012 --> 01:56:19,805
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

621
01:56:22,558 --> 01:56:24,810
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

622
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:30,023
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

623
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:31,692
<i>...was discovered.</i>

624
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:37,114
<i>It was buried
40 feet below the lunar surface...</i>

625
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:39,616
<i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>

626
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:45,497
<i>Except for a single, very powerful...</i>

627
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:49,626
<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

628
01:56:50,878 --> 01:56:55,882
<i>...the 4-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert...</i>

629
01:56:57,802 --> 01:57:00,887
<i>...its origin and purpose...</i>

630
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:03,056
<i>...still a total mystery.</i>
