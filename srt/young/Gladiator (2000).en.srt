1
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:19,950
- Sir.
- General.

2
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,328
- General.
- Sir.

3
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,580
General.

4
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,707
- Sir.
- General.

5
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,376
General.

6
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,045
- Sir.

7
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,479
Lean and hungry.

8
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,901
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

9
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,862
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

10
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,868
- Will they fight, sir?
- We shall know soon enough.

11
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,579
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

12
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:09,166
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

13
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,712
- The danger to the cavalry-
- It is acceptable. Agreed?

14
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,056
They say no.

15
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,609
- Steady! Steady!

16
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,834
People should know
when they're conquered.

17
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,849
Would you, Quintus?
Would I?

18
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,200
Strength and honor.

19
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,827
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

20
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,960
At my signal, unleash hell.

21
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:01,070
Load the catapults.

22
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,572
Infantry form up for advance.

23
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,033
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

24
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,910
- Knock!
- Knock!

25
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,895
- Patres!
- Maximus!

26
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,192
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

27
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:44,739
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

28
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:49,035
Hold the line!
Stay with me!

29
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,829
If you find yourself alone,

30
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,540
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

31
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,045
do not be troubled.

32
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,757
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

33
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,761
Brothers,

34
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,806
what we do in life...

35
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,850
echoes in eternity.

36
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,109
- Pull!

37
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,828
Pull! Pull!

38
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,794
Catapults ready, sir!

39
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,015
Archers, ignite!

40
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,685
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

41
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,151
Archers, draw!

42
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,864
Loose!

43
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,035
Loose!

44
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,253
Aah!

45
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,422
Aah!

46
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,388
- Aah!
- Aah!

47
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,105
All right, men, ready!

48
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,029
Hold the line!

49
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,328
Draw! Loose!

50
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,581
Loose! Loose!

51
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,583
Reload!

52
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,131
Hold the line!

53
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,508
Draw! Loose!

54
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,889
Stay with me!

55
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,520
Stay with me!

56
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,218
Roma Victor!

57
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,695
Aah!

58
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,581
Aah!

59
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:38,556
Aah!

60
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,355
Aah!

61
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,568
Aah!

62
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,545
Aah!

63
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,636
Aah!

64
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,248
Aah!

65
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,373
Roma Victor!

66
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:12,043
Do you think he's really dying?

67
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,087
He's been dying for ten years.

68
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:18,382
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

69
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,635
Maybe he just misses us.

70
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,472
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if-

71
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,474
Peace, Commodus.

72
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:30,144
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

73
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,486
He's made his decision.

74
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,988
He's going to announce it.

75
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,077
He will name me.

76
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,665
The first thing I shall do...

77
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,668
when-

78
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:59,131
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

79
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,636
For now, the first thing
I shall do is have a bath.

80
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,098
- Your Highness?

81
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,436
We seem to be almost there, sir.

82
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:21,153
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

83
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:24,365
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

84
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,201
The wounded are still coming in.

85
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,203
My horse.

86
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,205
Mylord.

87
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,293
Kiss?

88
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,538
You have proved your valor...

89
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,750
yet again, Maximus.

90
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,795
Let us hope for the last time.

91
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,673
There's no one
left to fight, sire.

92
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,217
Ah. There is always
someone left to fight.

93
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,220
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

94
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,228
Let me go home.

95
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,981
Ah. Home.

96
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,406
Whoa! Whoa!

97
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,293
They honor you, Caesar.

98
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:02,296
It's for you, Maximus.
They honor you.

99
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,863
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

100
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,616
You have missed the war.

101
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,035
Father, congratulations.

102
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,038
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph.

103
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,124
Save the bulls.

104
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,376
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.

105
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,462
- General.
- Highness.

106
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:47,842
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

107
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,177
It has been too long,
my old friend.

108
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,346
- Highness.
- Here, Father.

109
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,724
Take my arm.

110
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,811
I think it is time
for me to leave.

111
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,996
So much for the glory of Rome.

112
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,727
Magnificent battle.

113
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,169
- General.
- Still alive?

114
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:08,255
- Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

115
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:11,008
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

116
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,636
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

117
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,806
Home. My wife,
the son, the harvest.

118
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,018
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

119
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:24,730
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

120
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,982
- Here he is.
- Highness.

121
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,943
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

122
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,446
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed
potion in your ear...

123
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,282
and you'll wake up one day,
and all you'll say is,
" Republic, republic, republic."

124
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,452
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

125
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:41,372
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

126
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,874
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, of course.

127
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,627
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?

128
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:51,966
The soldier has the advantage
of being able to look
his enemy in the eye, Senator.

129
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:56,053
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

130
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,015
I warned you.
Now I shall save you. Senators.

131
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,152
Maximus.

132
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,071
I'm going to need
good men like you.

133
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,659
How may I be of service,
Highness?

134
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,620
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

135
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:25,166
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

136
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:29,879
But these senators scheme
and squabble and flatter and deceive.

137
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,424
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

138
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,053
Can I count on you...
when the time comes?

139
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,103
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

140
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:50,316
Home?
Well, no one's earned it more.

141
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,403
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

142
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:59,283
Lucilla's here.
Did you know?

143
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,244
She's not forgotten you.

144
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,580
And now you're the great man.

145
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,637
If only you had been born a man.

146
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,682
What a Caesar
you would have made.

147
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,644
Father.

148
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,026
You would have been strong.

149
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,196
I wonder,
would you have been just?

150
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,907
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

151
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,410
Oh.

152
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,412
How was your journey?

153
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:48,749
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

154
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,335
I need your help.
With your brother.

155
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,546
Of course.

156
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,548
He loves you.
He always has.

157
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,719
And...

158
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,222
he will need you now
more than ever.

159
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,854
Enough of politics.

160
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:14,275
Let us pretend that you
are a loving daughter...

161
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,360
and I am a good father.

162
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:25,202
This is a pleasant fiction,
isn't it?

163
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:39,467
Good morning.

164
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,690
I need three more horses.

165
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,702
Two! Three!

166
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:08,746
Four!

167
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,457
One! Two!

168
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,017
You sent for me, Caesar?

169
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:34,313
Caesar?

170
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:37,817
Tell me again, Maximus.

171
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,820
Why are we here?

172
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,823
For the glory
of the Empire, sire.

173
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,825
Ah, yes.

174
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,328
Ah, yes, I remember.

175
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,333
Do you see that map, Maximus?

176
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,504
That is the world
which I created.

177
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,881
For25years...

178
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:05,761
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the Empire.

179
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:09,807
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

180
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,184
Four years of peace in 20.

181
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,021
And for what?

182
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,114
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

183
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,867
Caesar, your life-

184
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,037
Please.
Please don't call me that.

185
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,873
Come. Please.

186
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,125
Come sit.

187
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,420
Let us talk together now-

188
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,797
very simply-as men.

189
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:47,136
Maximus... talk.

190
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,642
Five thousand of my men
are out there in the freezing mud.

191
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,145
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

192
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,314
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

193
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,858
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

194
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,860
And what would you
believe, Maximus?

195
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:06,155
They fought for you...
and for Rome.

196
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,116
And what is Rome, Maximus?

197
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:12,661
I've seen much of
the rest of the world.

198
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:16,665
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

199
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,793
Yet you have never been there.

200
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,295
You have not seen
what it has become.

201
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,423
I am dying, Maximus.

202
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:26,425
When a man sees his end,

203
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:30,012
he wants to know there was
some purpose this life.

204
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:33,724
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

205
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,143
Will I be known
as the philosopher?

206
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,480
The warrior?
The tyrant?

207
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,569
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

208
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,739
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

209
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,867
You could only whisper it.

210
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,954
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish.

211
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,206
It was so fragile.

212
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,960
And I fear that it will not
survive the winter.

213
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,797
Maximus,

214
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Let us whisper now,

215
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,136
together, you and I.

216
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,888
You have a son.

217
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:15,725
Tell me about your home.

218
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:26,569
My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.
A very simple place.

219
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,032
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

220
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:35,119
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

221
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,121
jasmine in the evening.

222
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:41,709
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

223
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,628
Figs, apples, pears.

224
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,630
The soil, Marcus- black.

225
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,550
- Black like my wife's hair.

226
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:51,886
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

227
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,555
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

228
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:57,475
- He wants to be one of them.
- Remember the last time you were home?

229
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,936
Two years, 264 days,
and this morning.

230
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,774
I envy you, Maximus.

231
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:08,569
It's a good home.
Worth fighting for.

232
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:14,617
There is one more duty...

233
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:17,953
that I ask of you
before you go home.

234
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,582
What would you
have me do, Caesar?

235
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,086
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

236
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:29,465
I will empower you
to one end alone.

237
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:33,803
To give power back
to the people of Rome...

238
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:37,014
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

239
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,524
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

240
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,320
With all my heart, no.

241
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,907
Maximus,

242
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,910
that is why it must be you.

243
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,912
But surely a prefect, a senator,

244
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:02,832
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

245
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,876
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

246
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:15,177
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

247
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,513
You have known that
since you were young.

248
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,182
Commodus cannot rule.

249
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,518
He must not rule.

250
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,605
You are the son
that I should have had.

251
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:32,778
Commodus will accept
my decision.

252
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:39,326
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

253
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,042
I- I need some time, sire.

254
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,044
Yes.

255
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:52,131
By sunset,
I hope you will have agreed.

256
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:55,176
Now embrace me as my son.

257
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,598
And bring an old man
another blanket.

258
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,741
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

259
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,160
It was not always so.

260
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,454
Many things change.

261
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,332
Many things.
Not everything.

262
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,087
Maximus, stop.

263
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:37,426
Let me see your face.

264
00:28:37,468 --> 00:28:40,262
Hmm. You seem upset.

265
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,473
I lost many men.

266
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,393
What did my father
want with you?

267
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,979
To wish me well
before I leave for home.

268
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:51,107
You're lying.

269
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,694
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

270
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:57,279
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

271
00:28:57,363 --> 00:28:59,949
But then you never had to.

272
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,743
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

273
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,832
Or do you think me heartless?

274
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,876
I think you have
a talent for survival.

275
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,635
Maximus, stop.

276
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:22,555
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

277
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,350
No. I'm tired
from battle.

278
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:29,228
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

279
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,027
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

280
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:41,407
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

281
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,995
I will always serve Rome.

282
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,457
Do you know,

283
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,001
I still remember you
in my prayers.

284
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,964
Oh, yes. I pray.

285
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,471
I was sad to hear
of your husband's death. I mourned him.

286
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:08,517
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

287
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:13,647
Yes. Lucius.

288
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,983
He'll be nearly eight years old.

289
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:18,611
My son is also nearly eight.

290
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,366
I thank you for your prayers.

291
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,127
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

292
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:39,715
Blessed mother, come tome
with the gods' desire for my future.

293
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,594
Blessed father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

294
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:49,225
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

295
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,645
Ancestors, I honor you...

296
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:56,148
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.

297
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,964
Cicero.

298
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,178
Sir.

299
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:32,143
You don't find it hard
to do your duty?

300
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,816
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

301
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:41,652
The rest of the time
I do what I have to.

302
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,366
We may not be able
to go home after all.

303
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:20,149
Are you ready to do
your duty for Rome?

304
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,446
Yes, Father.

305
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:27,448
You will not be emperor.

306
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:33,204
Which wiser,
older man is to take my place?

307
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,582
My powers
will pass to Maximus...

308
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,918
to hold in trust...

309
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:43,547
until the Senate
is ready to rule once more.

310
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:48,386
Rome is to be a republic again.

311
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,807
- Maximus.
- Yes.

312
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,356
My decision disappoints you?

313
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:08,030
You wrote to me once,

314
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:11,951
Listing the four chief virtues.

315
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,204
Wisdom, justice,

316
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:18,582
fortitude and temperance.

317
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:25,089
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

318
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,718
But I have other virtues, Father.

319
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:31,387
Ambition.

320
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,432
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

321
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:39,145
Resourcefulness.
Courage.

322
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:42,440
Perhaps not on
the battlefield, but...

323
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,776
there are many forms of courage.

324
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,113
Devotion- to my family...

325
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,741
and to you.

326
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:56,454
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

327
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,875
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

328
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,461
Oh, Commodus.

329
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:06,255
You go too far.

330
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:09,925
I search the faces
of the gods...

331
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:14,764
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

332
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,183
One kind word,

333
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,602
one full hug...

334
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:24,523
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight,

335
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:27,568
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years.

336
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,908
- What is it in me you hate so much?
- Shah, Commodus.

337
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:38,037
All I've ever wanted...

338
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,625
was to live up to you, Caesar.

339
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,628
Father.

340
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,297
Commodus.

341
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:53,761
Your faults as a son...

342
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:57,765
is my failure as a father.

343
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:10,569
Come.

344
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,408
Father.

345
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:32,883
I would butcher
the whole world...

346
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,678
if you would only love me!

347
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:16,886
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

348
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,895
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.

349
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:56,050
How did he die?

350
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,803
The surgeons say there was no pain.

351
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,971
His breath gave out as he slept.

352
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,066
Father.

353
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,071
Your emperor asks
for your loyalty, Maximus.

354
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:21,158
Take my hand.

355
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,830
I only offer it once.

356
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:41,012
Quintus.

357
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,897
Hail, Caesar.

358
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,733
I must go to the senators.
I need their counsel.

359
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:38,361
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

360
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,654
- Sword.
- Sword.

361
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,659
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

362
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:49,121
Prudent?
The Emperor has been slain.

363
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:52,416
The Emperor died of natural causes.

364
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,503
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

365
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:00,966
Please don't fight, Maximus.

366
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:05,304
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

367
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:09,934
Ride until dawn...
and then execute him.

368
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,436
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!

369
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,606
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

370
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:19,360
Your family will meet you
in the afterlife.

371
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,695
- No!

372
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,263
Kneel.

373
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,393
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

374
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:54,562
- Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.

375
00:39:57,148 --> 00:39:59,650
At least give me a clean death.

376
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:03,195
A soldier's death.

377
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:28,012
The frost, sometimes it makes
the blade stick.

378
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,534
Praetorian!

379
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:54,372
Hyah! Hyah!

380
00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:11,907
Remember the last time you were home?

381
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:16,537
Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

382
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,958
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

383
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:24,378
Whisper to them I live only
to hold them again.

384
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:27,798
For all else is dust and air,
and I live only to hold them again.

385
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:32,136
For all else is dust and air.

386
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,551
- Mama, isoldati!

387
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:33,406
- Papa! Papa!

388
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,247
Hyah! Hyah!

389
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,906
- Don't die.

390
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:27,997
- You'll meet them again.

391
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,292
- Not yet.

392
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:43,471
No! They will clean it.
Wait and see.

393
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:19,340
Don't die.

394
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,759
They'll feed you to the lions.

395
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,803
They are worth more than we are.

396
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:36,565
Better now?

397
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:38,609
Clean. You see?

398
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:11,183
Proximo!

399
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,769
My old friend.

400
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:17,106
Every day is a great day
when you are here.

401
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:21,819
Today...
is your most fortunate day.

402
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,657
Those giraffes you sold me...

403
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:28,701
they won't mate.

404
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:33,372
They just walk around
eating and not mating.

405
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:36,834
You sold me...
queer giraffes.

406
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:41,255
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

407
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:46,969
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

408
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:51,390
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

409
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,324
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

410
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:11,077
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

411
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,162
You need both, I think.

412
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:15,206
Get up!

413
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:26,509
- What's your trade?
- I was a hunter.

414
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:30,513
Oh, no. I bought him
from a salt mine in Carthage.

415
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,848
Sit down!

416
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,854
Mark of the legion.

417
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:42,024
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

418
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,193
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six...

419
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,237
- for 1,000.
- 1,000?

420
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:48,489
The Numidian alone
is worth 2,000!

421
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:51,242
These slaves are rotten.

422
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,536
It all adds to the flavor.
No. No, no, no. Wait-Wait.

423
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:57,540
Wait! Can negotiate.

424
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:02,086
I'll give you 2,000...
and four for the beasts.

425
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:05,673
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

426
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:24,316
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

427
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,194
I am Proximo!

428
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:30,281
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

429
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,909
which will be last of your miserable
lives, than that bitch of a mother...

430
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:36,912
- that brought you screaming
into this world!

431
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:40,875
I did not pay good money
for you for your company!

432
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:46,297
- I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

433
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,134
And as your mother
was there at your beginning,

434
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:53,512
so I shall be there at your end.

435
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:58,267
- And when you die, and die you shall,

436
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:01,312
your transition shall be
to the sound of-

437
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:10,112
Gladiators, I salute you.

438
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,161
- Red!
- Red.

439
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:21,499
- Yellow!

440
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,001
Yellow.

441
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:33,636
Hyah!

442
00:51:33,678 --> 00:51:36,013
Good.

443
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:37,556
- Red.
- Red!

444
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,188
Spaniard!

445
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:11,674
- Uhh.

446
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,849
That's enough for the moment!

447
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,435
His time will come.

448
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,730
Next!

449
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:43,039
Spaniard, why don't you fight?

450
00:52:42,872 --> 00:52:45,499
We all have to fight.

451
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:00,931
Is that the sign of your gods?

452
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:09,190
Will that not anger them?

453
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:31,837
The gods favor you.

454
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:34,882
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:38,302
You will need their help today.

456
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:58,656
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight.

457
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,075
Some that you can't fight.

458
00:54:02,535 --> 00:54:06,539
They all say that,
until they're out there.

459
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,502
- Listen.
- Kill. Kill. Kill.

460
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:14,046
Kill. Kill. Kill.

461
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:22,179
Thrust this
into another man's flesh,

462
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:25,141
and then they will applaud
and love you for that.

463
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,477
You-

464
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:30,896
You may begin to love them...

465
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,774
for that.

466
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:41,323
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

467
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:46,829
Sadly, we cannot
choose how, but...

468
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:50,499
we can decide how
we meet that end...

469
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,462
in order that
we are remembered...

470
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,505
as men.

471
00:55:00,885 --> 00:55:03,637
On the left, draw your shields!

472
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,724
On the right, draw your swords!

473
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,768
- Kill. Kill-

474
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,981
Pair them up- red with yellow.

475
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,444
Next!

476
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,366
Next!

477
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,648
- Hyah! Hyah!

478
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:09,508
- Go away!

479
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,792
He enters Rome
like a conquering hero.

480
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,835
But what has he conquered?

481
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:47,922
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

482
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,965
I think he could do very well.

483
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,967
For Rome or for you?

484
00:59:58,057 --> 01:00:00,810
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

485
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:11,153
- Lucius!
- Mother!

486
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:16,325
- Hail, Caesar.
- Senators.

487
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,997
Rome greets her new emperor.

488
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:25,543
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

489
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:29,046
Thank you, Falco.
And for the loyal subjects,

490
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:32,591
- I trust they weren't too expensive.
- Caesar.

491
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:36,762
- Gracchus.
- All Rome rejoices
in your return, Caesar.

492
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:39,015
There are many matters
that require your attention.

493
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:45,521
- To order! To order!

494
01:00:45,563 --> 01:00:50,317
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

495
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:53,821
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city.

496
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:58,075
Beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter...

497
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,287
to combat the plague which is already
springing up there.

498
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,790
- So, if Caesar-
- Shah.

499
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:09,003
Don't you see, Gracchus?

500
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:11,297
That's the very problem,
isn't it?

501
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,467
My father spent
all his time at study...

502
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,097
of books and learning
and philosophy.

503
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:25,227
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

504
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:28,647
And all the while,
the people have forgotten-

505
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:31,150
But the Senate
is the People, sire.

506
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:34,945
Chosen from among the people...
to speak for the people.

507
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:39,617
I doubt that many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

508
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:44,872
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.

509
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:48,668
Then, perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us...

510
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:51,003
out of his own
extensive experience.

511
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,884
- I call it love.

512
01:01:56,926 --> 01:02:00,846
- I am their father.
The people are my children.

513
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,140
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

514
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,685
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

515
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:18,197
No, but if you interrupt me again,
I assure you that you shall.

516
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,242
Senator, my brother
is very tired.

517
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:23,869
Leave your list with me.

518
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:26,622
Caesar shall do
all that Rome requires.

519
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:31,585
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

520
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:41,137
Who are they to lecture me?

521
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,806
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

522
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:46,642
What uses?
All they do is talk.

523
01:02:48,102 --> 01:02:51,105
It should be just...
you and me...

524
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:53,733
- and Rome.
- Don't even think it!

525
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:56,235
There's always been a Senate.

526
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:00,614
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor...

527
01:03:00,698 --> 01:03:03,534
- to rule an empire.
- Of course, but leave the people their-

528
01:03:03,576 --> 01:03:06,203
Illusions.

529
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,539
Traditions.

530
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:11,876
My father's war
against the barbarians-

531
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:14,670
He said it himself,
it achieved nothing.

532
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:17,882
- But the people loved him.
- The people always love victories.

533
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:22,845
Why? They didn't see the battles.

534
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:26,891
- What do they care about Germania?
- They care about the greatness of Rome.

535
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:30,853
The greatness of Rome.

536
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,647
Well, what is that?

537
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,487
It's an idea- greatness.

538
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:46,786
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

539
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:51,540
Do you not see, Lucilla?

540
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:56,253
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

541
01:03:56,337 --> 01:04:00,883
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry, old men.

542
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:15,690
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

543
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:09,535
Vino, vino, vino!
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

544
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:17,668
Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine
for your drinking pleasure!

545
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,670
Games.

546
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:24,383
150 days of games.

547
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:28,095
- He's cleverer than I thought.
- Oh, clever.

548
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:30,848
The whole of Rome would
be laughing at him...

549
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,517
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

550
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:37,063
Fear and wonder-
a powerful combination.

551
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:39,982
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

552
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:44,362
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

553
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,740
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

554
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:51,869
Take away their freedom
and still they'll roar.

555
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,497
The beating heart of Rome...

556
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,791
is not the marble of the Senate.

557
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:59,251
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

558
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:02,630
He'll bring them death,

559
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:07,009
and they will love him for it.

560
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,768
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

561
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,491
Spaniard.

562
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:32,993
- Spain.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

563
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:36,205
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

564
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:39,834
Guard!

565
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,775
- Are you not entertained?

566
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:48,110
Are you not entertained?

567
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:53,366
Is this not why you are here?

568
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:01,374
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

569
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:05,753
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

570
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,758
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

571
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:14,845
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

572
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:20,059
What do you want?

573
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:22,144
Huh?

574
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:24,146
Girl?

575
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,148
Boy?

576
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:29,360
- You sent for me?
- Yes, I did.

577
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:32,613
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

578
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:36,325
- You could be magnificent.
- I'm required to kill, so I kill.

579
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,327
That is enough.

580
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:41,789
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

581
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,544
- The young emperor...

582
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,588
has arranged
a series of spectacles...

583
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,051
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

584
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:56,095
I find that amusing...

585
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:58,139
since it was Marcus Aurelius-

586
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,975
the wise, the all-knowing
Marcus Aurelius-

587
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:03,269
- that closed us down.

588
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:09,817
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living...

589
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,486
in flea-infested villages,

590
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,865
we're finally going back
to where we belong-

591
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:18,034
the Colosseum.

592
01:09:18,117 --> 01:09:22,538
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

593
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:27,168
Fifty-thousand Romans...

594
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:31,213
watching...
every movement of your sword,

595
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:34,633
willing you to make
that killer blow.

596
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:38,429
The silence before you strike...

597
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:40,556
and the noise afterwards,

598
01:09:40,598 --> 01:09:43,642
it rises- it rises up like-

599
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:47,813
Like Th- Like-Like a storm...

600
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:49,899
as if you were
the thunder god himself.

601
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:54,028
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

602
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,119
You won your freedom?

603
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:05,790
A long time ago, the emperor...

604
01:10:05,831 --> 01:10:08,376
presented me with a rudius.

605
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:11,295
It's just a wooden sword.

606
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:16,967
The symbol of your freedom.
He-

607
01:10:17,051 --> 01:10:21,639
- He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

608
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:25,518
- You knew Marcus Aurelius?
- I did not say I knew him.

609
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,770
I said he touched me
on the shoulder once.

610
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:32,525
You asked me what I want.

611
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:35,152
I, too, want to stand
in front of the emperor...

612
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,364
as you did.

613
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,284
Then, listen to me.
Learn from me.

614
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:46,539
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

615
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:50,209
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

616
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:55,381
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

617
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,511
I will win the crowd.

618
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:06,726
- I will give them something
they have never seen before.
- Ha!

619
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,479
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

620
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:12,565
and have bloody adventures!

621
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,734
And the great whore
will suckle us until we are...

622
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,944
fat and happy and
can suckle no more.

623
01:11:17,028 --> 01:11:19,530
And then,

624
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:23,367
when enough men have died,

625
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:25,411
perhaps you will
have your freedom.

626
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,711
Here. Use this.

627
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:57,943
It's somewhere out there-

628
01:11:58,027 --> 01:12:02,865
my country, my home.

629
01:12:02,907 --> 01:12:06,702
My wife is preparing food.

630
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:10,206
My daughters carry
water from the river.

631
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,583
Will I ever see them again?

632
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,710
I think no.

633
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:17,755
Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?

634
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:20,341
I think so.

635
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:24,804
But then, I will die soon.

636
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,806
They will not die
for many years.

637
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:32,561
- I'll have to wait.
- But you would... wait.

638
01:12:32,645 --> 01:12:36,273
Of course.

639
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:38,776
You see,

640
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:43,656
my wife...
and my son...

641
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,658
are already waiting for me.

642
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,244
You'll meet them again.

643
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:51,497
But not yet.

644
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:57,586
Not yet. Unless-

645
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,588
Not yet.

646
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:05,136
Not yet.

647
01:14:07,365 --> 01:14:09,992
Out!

648
01:14:10,076 --> 01:14:12,244
Go, go. Out!

649
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:26,509
Good to see you again,
old friend.

650
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:33,766
Bring me fortune.

651
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:41,732
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

652
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:45,861
- I didn't know men
could build such things.

653
01:14:55,079 --> 01:14:56,997
Win the crowd.

654
01:14:57,081 --> 01:15:00,710
Get Inside! Move. Inside.

655
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:53,137
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

656
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:59,727
Come, brother.
It's late.

657
01:16:01,354 --> 01:16:04,315
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

658
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,737
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

659
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:14,617
All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.

660
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:23,709
Commodus, drink this tonic.

661
01:16:32,927 --> 01:16:36,555
I think the time
is almost right.

662
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,766
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

663
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,768
at the celebration
to honor our father.

664
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:43,979
You think I should?

665
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,023
Are the people ready?

666
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:49,568
I think you need your rest now.

667
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,912
- Will you stay with me?
- Still afraid of the dark, brother?

668
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:13,259
Still. Always.

669
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:16,262
- Stay with me tonight?
- You know I won't.

670
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:22,184
Then, kiss me.

671
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:33,988
Sleep, brother.

672
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,883
Come on now.
Get out of the way!

673
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,515
I want you. I want you.
I want you so-

674
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:03,851
All right, Let him pass!

675
01:18:20,076 --> 01:18:22,411
- Sixty!

676
01:18:22,495 --> 01:18:26,040
-500!

677
01:18:26,082 --> 01:18:29,251
The emperor wants battles, and I don't
want to sacrifice my best fighters.

678
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:32,880
The crowd wants battles,
so the emperor gives them battles.

679
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:35,216
And you get
the battle of Carthage.

680
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,761
The massacre of Carthage.
Guten tag.

681
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:42,056
Oh, why don't you go down
to the prison and round up
all the beggars and thieves.

682
01:18:42,098 --> 01:18:44,058
We've done that.

683
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:47,019
If you want to give away
the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire,

684
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:49,563
I want double the rates.

685
01:18:49,647 --> 01:18:53,109
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

686
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,152
You don't like it?

687
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:59,156
Then you can crawl back down
that shithole that you came from.

688
01:19:00,825 --> 01:19:03,744
- Cassius, please! Please, Cassius!

689
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:36,652
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

690
01:19:36,736 --> 01:19:40,740
- Yes.
- They said you were a giant.

691
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,993
They said you could
crush a man's skull with one hand.

692
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,329
A man's? No.

693
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:50,207
A boy's.

694
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:55,212
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

695
01:19:55,296 --> 01:19:59,675
This is Argento,
and this is Scarto.

696
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:02,803
They were my horses.

697
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:07,475
- They were taken from me.
- I like you, Spaniard.

698
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:10,061
- I shall cheer for you.
- They let you watch the games?

699
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:13,773
- My uncle says it makes me strong.
- And what does your father say?

700
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:15,816
My father's dead.

701
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:20,946
Master Lucius, it is time.

702
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,658
- I have to go.
- Your name is Lucius?

703
01:20:26,369 --> 01:20:28,746
Lucius Verus, after my father.

704
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:01,028
Lower!

705
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,870
- Claudius! More shields!
- Yes, sir.

706
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:32,977
When the emperor enters,

707
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,231
raise your weapons,
salute him and then speak together!

708
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:42,528
Face the emperor and don't
turn your back on him!

709
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:46,407
Go, and die with honor!

710
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:43,589
Hail, mighty Caesar!

711
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:47,593
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

712
01:22:47,677 --> 01:22:50,179
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

713
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,268
And we who are about to die, salute you!

714
01:22:57,478 --> 01:23:00,523
On this day,

715
01:23:00,606 --> 01:23:04,485
we reach back
to hallowed antiquity...

716
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:07,947
to bring you a recreation
of the second fall...

717
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:10,074
of mighty Carthage!

718
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:18,999
On the barren plain of Zama,

719
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:22,461
there stood
the invincible armies...

720
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:25,715
of the barbarian, Hannibal.

721
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:28,884
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors...

722
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:31,595
from all brute nations...

723
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,849
bent on merciless...

724
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:38,644
destruction, conquest.

725
01:23:38,728 --> 01:23:42,773
Your emperor
is pleased to give you...

726
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:45,609
the barbarian horde!

727
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:57,747
- Anyone here been in the army?
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,874
I served with you at Vindobona.

729
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:02,835
You can help me.

730
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:06,589
Whatever comes
out of these gates,

731
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:09,467
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

732
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:12,970
Do you understand?

733
01:24:14,013 --> 01:24:16,807
If we stay together, we survive.

734
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:19,477
I'm pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

735
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:24,190
of Scipio Africanus!

736
01:24:34,742 --> 01:24:37,203
To the death!

737
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:44,377
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

738
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:47,838
Stay close!

739
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:55,888
Come together!

740
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,516
- Staggered columns!

741
01:24:58,599 --> 01:25:00,810
Staggered columns!

742
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,699
Soon all your men will be slain.

743
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:16,701
You don't have a chance!

744
01:25:27,795 --> 01:25:29,296
Lock your shields! Stay as one!

745
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,340
As one! As one!

746
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:33,009
Hold!

747
01:25:35,136 --> 01:25:36,721
Hold!

748
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:38,889
- As one!
- As one!

749
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:42,935
Well done!

750
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,315
Hyah! Hyah!

751
01:25:54,447 --> 01:25:56,032
Hold!

752
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:59,076
Diamond! Diamond!

753
01:26:03,748 --> 01:26:05,583
- Yes!

754
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:19,263
- Haken!

755
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:45,122
This column to the chariots!
This column...

756
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:46,999
-stay with me!

757
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:51,671
Quickly!

758
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:54,507
- Get out there!
- Hurry!

759
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,009
Maximus!

760
01:27:41,137 --> 01:27:42,388
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.

761
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:51,397
Single column!
Single column!

762
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,107
Single column! Single column!

763
01:28:37,068 --> 01:28:39,737
- We win!

764
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:47,078
My history's
a little hazy, Cassius.

765
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:50,039
But shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

766
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:52,458
Uh, yes, sire.

767
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,794
Um, forgive me, sire.

768
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:58,547
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

769
01:28:58,631 --> 01:29:03,844
- Who is he?
- They call him the Spaniard, sire.

770
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:09,809
- I think I'll meet him.
- Yes, sire.

771
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:13,896
Hail to the barbarians!

772
01:29:27,993 --> 01:29:32,665
Forward! Arms at ready!

773
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:46,846
Drop your weapons!

774
01:29:49,098 --> 01:29:53,728
Gladiator, the emperor
has asked for you.

775
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:55,771
I'm at the emperor's service.

776
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:26,886
Rise. Rise.

777
01:30:34,518 --> 01:30:36,729
Your fame is well deserved,
Spaniard.

778
01:30:36,812 --> 01:30:39,815
I don't think there's ever
been a gladiator to match you.

779
01:30:39,857 --> 01:30:42,401
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

780
01:30:42,485 --> 01:30:45,071
Or was it Hercules?

781
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:48,991
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

782
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:55,831
- You do have a name?
- My name is Gladiator.

783
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:01,253
- How dare you show your back to me?

784
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:03,756
Slave!

785
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:05,883
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

786
01:31:17,812 --> 01:31:20,731
My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

787
01:31:20,773 --> 01:31:23,150
commander of the armies
of the north,

788
01:31:23,234 --> 01:31:25,986
general of the Felix Legions,

789
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:30,491
Loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

790
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:33,035
father to a murdered son,

791
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:35,913
husband to a murdered wife...

792
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:39,583
and I will have my vengeance...
in this life or the next.

793
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:49,301
Arms!

794
01:32:00,438 --> 01:32:04,942
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

795
01:32:05,026 --> 01:32:10,698
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

796
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:15,453
Live! Live! Live!

797
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:19,040
Live! Live!
Live! Live!

798
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:55,284
Guards, at rest!

799
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:49,130
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

800
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:52,425
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

801
01:33:52,508 --> 01:33:55,511
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

802
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:18,451
Why is he still alive?

803
01:34:18,534 --> 01:34:20,661
I don't know.

804
01:34:20,745 --> 01:34:22,997
He shouldn't be alive.

805
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,916
It vexes me.

806
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,919
I'm terribly vexed.

807
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:40,806
I did what I had to do.

808
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:45,770
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

809
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:48,064
You do see that?

810
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:50,066
Yes.

811
01:34:53,778 --> 01:34:57,198
What did you feel...
when you saw him?

812
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:02,328
I felt nothing.

813
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:05,373
He wounded you deeply,
didn't he?

814
01:35:06,499 --> 01:35:09,877
No more than I wounded him.

815
01:35:13,381 --> 01:35:15,716
They lied to me in Germania.

816
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:19,804
They told me he was dead.

817
01:35:21,097 --> 01:35:24,016
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

818
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:26,769
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

819
01:35:28,646 --> 01:35:31,357
Then you must
let the legions know...

820
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,985
their treachery
will not go unpunished.

821
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:39,448
Poor sister, I wouldn't
want to be your enemy.

822
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:42,910
What will you do?

823
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,048
This way!

824
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:35,129
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured
by the bravest champions.

825
01:36:35,212 --> 01:36:38,215
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

826
01:36:38,299 --> 01:36:41,010
I didn't realize
he would send his best.

827
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:45,431
Maximus, he doesn't know.

828
01:36:45,473 --> 01:36:48,434
My family was burned and crucified
while they were still alive.

829
01:36:48,476 --> 01:36:51,437
- I knew nothing-
- Don't lie to me!

830
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:01,238
- I wept for them.
- As you wept for your father?

831
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,991
As you wept for your father?

832
01:37:04,075 --> 01:37:07,745
I have been living in
a prison of fear since that day.

833
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:12,458
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

834
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,461
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

835
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:17,797
because your son
is heir to the throne.

836
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:23,094
Oh, I have wept.

837
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:26,347
My son was innocent.

838
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:29,100
So is mine.

839
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:33,521
Must my son die, too,
before you will trust me?

840
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:39,360
What does it matter
if I trust you or not?

841
01:37:39,443 --> 01:37:42,321
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

842
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:45,866
Today I saw a slave become
more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

843
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,993
The gods have spared me?

844
01:37:48,077 --> 01:37:51,455
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob!

845
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:54,709
That is power.
The mob is Rome.

846
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:57,503
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

847
01:37:58,796 --> 01:38:00,756
Listen to me.

848
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,051
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the senate.

849
01:38:04,093 --> 01:38:06,554
But while the people follow him,

850
01:38:06,595 --> 01:38:09,724
no one would dare
stand up to him until you.

851
01:38:09,807 --> 01:38:12,810
They oppose him,
yet they do nothing.

852
01:38:12,893 --> 01:38:16,605
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

853
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:19,358
One man above all.

854
01:38:19,442 --> 01:38:22,653
If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?

855
01:38:22,737 --> 01:38:24,989
Do you not understand?

856
01:38:25,072 --> 01:38:29,285
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

857
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:31,787
What possible
difference can I make?

858
01:38:31,829 --> 01:38:34,457
This man wants what you want.

859
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:37,501
Then have him kill Commodus!

860
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,131
I knew a man once,

861
01:38:42,173 --> 01:38:45,551
a noble man,
a man of principle...

862
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:48,346
who loved my father.

863
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:51,223
And my father loved him.

864
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:54,935
This man served Rome well.

865
01:38:58,856 --> 01:39:01,108
That man is gone.

866
01:39:01,192 --> 01:39:03,444
Your brother did his work well.

867
01:39:03,527 --> 01:39:05,946
Let me help you.

868
01:39:11,494 --> 01:39:15,206
Yes, you can help me.

869
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:20,002
Forget you ever knew me...

870
01:39:20,086 --> 01:39:22,171
and never come here again.

871
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:28,678
Guard! The lady has finished with me.

872
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,207
Maximus?

873
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:01,961
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

874
01:40:02,003 --> 01:40:05,006
- Yes.
- In Germania?

875
01:40:06,757 --> 01:40:09,343
In many countries.

876
01:40:10,428 --> 01:40:13,014
General.

877
01:41:00,519 --> 01:41:03,064
You have a great name.

878
01:41:03,147 --> 01:41:06,108
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

879
01:41:15,534 --> 01:41:17,495
Yes, at the far end.

880
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:19,997
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

881
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:21,999
Senator Gracchus.

882
01:41:23,542 --> 01:41:26,921
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

883
01:41:27,004 --> 01:41:29,590
I don't pretend to be a man
of the people, Senator.

884
01:41:29,674 --> 01:41:32,760
But I do try to be a man
for the people.

885
01:41:46,732 --> 01:41:50,403
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

886
01:41:50,486 --> 01:41:52,446
Caesar! Caesar!

887
01:41:52,488 --> 01:41:56,242
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

888
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:00,705
People of Rome!

889
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:05,626
On the fourth day of Antioch,

890
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:09,630
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

891
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:15,720
And, in his majestic charity,

892
01:42:15,803 --> 01:42:20,433
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...

893
01:42:20,516 --> 01:42:24,687
with an historical final match.

894
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:27,023
Returning to the Colosseum today...

895
01:42:27,106 --> 01:42:31,569
after five years
in retirement, Caesar...

896
01:42:31,652 --> 01:42:35,531
is pleased to bring you
the only...

897
01:42:35,573 --> 01:42:37,867
undefeated champion...

898
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,369
- Yah! Yah!
- In Roman history,

899
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:45,666
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

900
01:43:00,765 --> 01:43:02,975
Whoa! Whoa!

901
01:43:06,771 --> 01:43:10,274
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

902
01:43:10,358 --> 01:43:13,069
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

903
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,613
This is not it!
This is not it!

904
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:18,282
Marcus Aurelius is dead,
Maximus.

905
01:43:18,366 --> 01:43:21,577
We mortals are but
shadows and dust.

906
01:43:21,619 --> 01:43:25,039
- Shadows and dust, Maximus!

907
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:28,459
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

908
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:32,380
Caesar is proud to give you...

909
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:35,758
Aelius Maximus!

910
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:46,310
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

911
01:43:46,394 --> 01:43:49,146
Maximus! Maximus!

912
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:51,482
They embrace him like
he's one of their own.

913
01:43:51,524 --> 01:43:55,236
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

914
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:58,155
Maximus! Maximus!

915
01:43:58,197 --> 01:44:01,242
No, much sooner than that.

916
01:44:03,035 --> 01:44:05,579
It's been arranged.

917
01:44:11,293 --> 01:44:14,422
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

918
01:44:23,264 --> 01:44:25,975
We who are about to die salute you.

919
01:44:29,603 --> 01:44:32,148
We're with you, Maximus!

920
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:16,442
Come on, finish it!

921
01:45:42,218 --> 01:45:44,804
- No!
- Pull! Pull!

922
01:45:58,567 --> 01:46:01,278
- Aah!

923
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:08,744
Yeah!

924
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:20,506
Loose! Loose!
Loose! Loose!

925
01:46:35,062 --> 01:46:38,107
Aah!

926
01:46:41,068 --> 01:46:43,696
Aah!

927
01:46:47,908 --> 01:46:49,785
Get him!
Kill him!

928
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:53,372
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

929
01:46:53,456 --> 01:46:56,417
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

930
01:46:56,459 --> 01:46:59,545
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

931
01:46:59,628 --> 01:47:02,715
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

932
01:47:02,798 --> 01:47:05,801
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

933
01:47:05,885 --> 01:47:10,097
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

934
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:13,142
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

935
01:47:13,184 --> 01:47:16,062
- Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill!

936
01:47:16,145 --> 01:47:18,647
- Kill!
- Kill!

937
01:47:18,731 --> 01:47:21,692
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

938
01:47:21,776 --> 01:47:25,821
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

939
01:47:25,905 --> 01:47:29,408
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

940
01:47:29,492 --> 01:47:33,162
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

941
01:47:33,245 --> 01:47:36,248
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

942
01:47:36,332 --> 01:47:40,044
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

943
01:47:53,933 --> 01:47:57,019
Maximus!
Maximus the Merciful!

944
01:47:57,103 --> 01:48:00,147
Maximus the Merciful!

945
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:06,987
Maximus the Merciful!

946
01:48:07,071 --> 01:48:09,031
Maximus! Maximus!

947
01:48:09,073 --> 01:48:11,409
Maximus! Maximus!

948
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:15,746
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

949
01:48:15,788 --> 01:48:18,416
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

950
01:48:18,624 --> 01:48:22,253
Forward, guards! On battery!

951
01:48:22,294 --> 01:48:24,296
Maximus! Maximus!

952
01:48:27,258 --> 01:48:30,845
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

953
01:48:30,928 --> 01:48:33,264
Maximus!
Maximus!

954
01:48:51,532 --> 01:48:55,870
What am I going to do with you?

955
01:48:55,953 --> 01:48:58,539
You simply won't...

956
01:48:58,622 --> 01:49:00,541
die.

957
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:07,548
Are we so different, you and I?

958
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:09,592
You take life
when you have to...

959
01:49:09,675 --> 01:49:11,677
as I do.

960
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:15,806
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

961
01:49:15,890 --> 01:49:18,184
Then take it now.

962
01:49:30,946 --> 01:49:33,574
They tell me your son...

963
01:49:33,616 --> 01:49:35,951
squealed like a girl...

964
01:49:36,035 --> 01:49:38,871
when they nailed him
to the cross.

965
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:43,584
And your wife...
moaned like a whore...

966
01:49:45,711 --> 01:49:47,838
when they ravaged her...

967
01:49:47,922 --> 01:49:50,216
again and again...

968
01:49:51,592 --> 01:49:53,511
and again.

969
01:49:58,307 --> 01:50:01,977
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end.

970
01:50:06,857 --> 01:50:08,984
Highness.

971
01:50:20,454 --> 01:50:24,500
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

972
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:27,962
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

973
01:50:28,045 --> 01:50:33,009
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

974
01:50:35,011 --> 01:50:38,556
General! General!

975
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,516
General!

976
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:43,269
- General! General!
- Get back!

977
01:50:43,352 --> 01:50:45,855
- General!
- Cicero!

978
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:48,899
Maximus! Maximus!

979
01:50:48,983 --> 01:50:51,193
- General!

980
01:50:51,277 --> 01:50:53,863
- General.
- Where are you camped?

981
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:57,491
- Ostia.
- Maximus! Maximus!

982
01:50:57,575 --> 01:51:01,787
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

983
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:04,665
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

984
01:51:04,749 --> 01:51:07,460
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

985
01:51:07,501 --> 01:51:10,629
- Move along!
- Find me!

986
01:51:10,713 --> 01:51:15,384
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

987
01:51:34,779 --> 01:51:37,198
Can they hear you?

988
01:51:40,242 --> 01:51:42,161
Who?

989
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:45,247
Your family, in the afterlife.

990
01:51:46,749 --> 01:51:49,168
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?

991
01:51:53,089 --> 01:51:55,383
To my boy,

992
01:51:55,424 --> 01:51:57,677
I tell him I will
see him again soon.

993
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:02,264
To keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

994
01:52:03,933 --> 01:52:05,851
To my wife-

995
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:10,064
That is not your business.

996
01:52:17,405 --> 01:52:20,449
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

997
01:52:21,992 --> 01:52:25,246
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful!

998
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:31,293
The whole thing's
like some crazed nightmare.

999
01:52:32,336 --> 01:52:34,797
He is defying you.

1000
01:52:34,839 --> 01:52:37,842
His every victory
is an act of defiance.

1001
01:52:37,883 --> 01:52:41,971
The mob sees this,
and so do the senate.

1002
01:52:42,013 --> 01:52:46,475
Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.

1003
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:48,644
- Kill him.
- No.

1004
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:52,815
I will not make a martyr of him.

1005
01:52:58,404 --> 01:53:00,573
I have been told...

1006
01:53:00,656 --> 01:53:02,575
of a certain sea snake...

1007
01:53:02,658 --> 01:53:06,996
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1008
01:53:07,079 --> 01:53:11,751
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1009
01:53:11,834 --> 01:53:14,086
Then its enemies will approach,

1010
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:17,089
and yet it will lie quite still.

1011
01:53:17,173 --> 01:53:21,469
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1012
01:53:21,552 --> 01:53:23,846
and yet it remains...

1013
01:53:23,929 --> 01:53:26,557
still.

1014
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:30,394
So,

1015
01:53:30,478 --> 01:53:33,022
we will lie still...

1016
01:53:33,105 --> 01:53:36,650
and let our enemies
come to us and nibble.

1017
01:53:36,734 --> 01:53:40,154
Have every senator followed.

1018
01:53:53,209 --> 01:53:55,169
Maximus.

1019
01:53:56,712 --> 01:53:58,673
Cicero, my old friend.

1020
01:53:58,714 --> 01:54:00,758
I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1021
01:54:00,841 --> 01:54:03,094
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1022
01:54:03,177 --> 01:54:05,513
How long have the men
been in Ostia?

1023
01:54:05,596 --> 01:54:08,557
- All winter.
- And how do they look?

1024
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:10,851
Fattened and bored.

1025
01:54:10,935 --> 01:54:12,895
Who's in command?

1026
01:54:12,937 --> 01:54:15,898
Some fool from Rome.

1027
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:19,402
- How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?
- For you, tomorrow.

1028
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:23,698
I need you to
do something for me.

1029
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:29,954
Come see. Witness.

1030
01:54:30,037 --> 01:54:32,873
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1031
01:54:32,957 --> 01:54:37,420
Giant Maximus is defeating
our Emperor Commodus. What are we to do?

1032
01:54:37,503 --> 01:54:40,256
He's defying everyone.
What will we do?

1033
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:43,050
- Ah! Look at that!

1034
01:54:43,134 --> 01:54:45,594
- Oh, he got him!

1035
01:54:45,636 --> 01:54:48,264
Give way! Give way!

1036
01:54:48,305 --> 01:54:50,433
Give way!

1037
01:54:52,309 --> 01:54:54,937
Three casks of red wine.

1038
01:54:55,021 --> 01:54:57,565
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1039
01:54:57,648 --> 01:54:59,567
- Back.
- Mylady.

1040
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:01,610
I served your father
at Vindobona.

1041
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:04,447
- Back!
- And I served the General Maximus.

1042
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:06,782
I serve him still.

1043
01:55:06,866 --> 01:55:08,784
Stop.

1044
01:55:08,868 --> 01:55:10,995
- Stop.
- Stop!

1045
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:14,331
Stand back.

1046
01:55:14,415 --> 01:55:17,168
The General sends word.
He will meet your politician.

1047
01:55:19,337 --> 01:55:23,507
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1048
01:55:23,591 --> 01:55:25,968
Hup!

1049
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:34,852
Leave us.

1050
01:55:39,482 --> 01:55:41,400
Senator Gracchus.

1051
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:57,249
General.

1052
01:55:57,291 --> 01:56:01,337
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough that...

1053
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:03,339
you can trust me.

1054
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:09,595
- The senate is with you?
- The senate?

1055
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:14,934
Yes. I can speak for them.

1056
01:56:14,975 --> 01:56:18,479
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1057
01:56:18,562 --> 01:56:21,482
To what end?

1058
01:56:21,524 --> 01:56:24,318
Get me outside the city walls.

1059
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,364
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army's encamped there.

1060
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:32,034
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of5,000 men.

1061
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:35,663
But the legions all have new commanders
loyal to Commodus.

1062
01:56:35,746 --> 01:56:38,999
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1063
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:41,168
This is madness.

1064
01:56:41,252 --> 01:56:44,714
- No Roman army has entered
the capital in a hundred years.
- Gracchus-

1065
01:56:44,755 --> 01:56:46,674
I will not trade
one dictatorship for another!

1066
01:56:46,716 --> 01:56:51,554
The time for half-measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1067
01:56:51,637 --> 01:56:55,141
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1068
01:56:55,224 --> 01:56:58,686
You'll take your
5,000 warriors and leave?

1069
01:56:58,769 --> 01:57:01,105
I will leave.

1070
01:57:01,188 --> 01:57:04,900
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,
under the command of the senate.

1071
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:08,362
So, once all of Rome is yours,

1072
01:57:08,446 --> 01:57:11,407
you'll just give it
back to the people?

1073
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:13,451
Tell me why.

1074
01:57:19,206 --> 01:57:21,667
Because that was the
last wish of a dying man.

1075
01:57:25,421 --> 01:57:27,340
I will kill Commodus.

1076
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:32,678
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1077
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,766
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1078
01:57:38,267 --> 01:57:40,686
His daughter trusts you.

1079
01:57:44,231 --> 01:57:46,317
I will trust you.

1080
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,903
But we have little time.

1081
01:57:48,986 --> 01:57:51,072
Give me two days...

1082
01:57:51,155 --> 01:57:54,367
and I will buy your freedom.

1083
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:57,203
And you-

1084
01:57:57,286 --> 01:58:00,039
You stay alive.

1085
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:02,458
Or I'll be dead.

1086
01:58:03,668 --> 01:58:05,670
Now we must go.

1087
01:58:10,841 --> 01:58:13,260
It won't work.

1088
01:58:13,302 --> 01:58:16,389
The Emperor knows too much.

1089
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:18,432
And as for me,

1090
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,770
it's becoming dangerous.

1091
01:58:22,853 --> 01:58:25,314
You will be paid on my return.

1092
01:58:27,108 --> 01:58:29,235
- I give you my word.

1093
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:31,987
Your word?
What if you don't return?

1094
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:35,491
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1095
01:58:35,574 --> 01:58:38,119
Trust?

1096
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:43,499
Who am I to trust?

1097
01:58:43,582 --> 01:58:46,293
I will kill Commodus.

1098
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:48,337
Why would I want that?

1099
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:50,339
He makes me rich.

1100
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:55,136
Oh, I-

1101
01:58:55,177 --> 01:58:58,472
I know that you are
a man of your word, General.

1102
01:58:59,849 --> 01:59:02,476
I know that you
would die for honor.

1103
01:59:03,978 --> 01:59:06,522
You would die for Rome.

1104
01:59:06,605 --> 01:59:09,025
You would die for
the memory of your ancestors.

1105
01:59:09,108 --> 01:59:11,902
But I, on the other hand-

1106
01:59:15,072 --> 01:59:16,991
I'm an entertainer.

1107
01:59:19,035 --> 01:59:21,454
Hmm? Guard!

1108
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:28,419
He killed the man
who set you free.

1109
01:59:37,678 --> 01:59:40,097
Praetorians, master.

1110
01:59:46,145 --> 01:59:48,105
Halt!

1111
01:59:58,032 --> 02:00:00,117
Where have you been?

1112
02:00:00,201 --> 02:00:02,161
I sent for you.

1113
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:05,289
Please, brother.

1114
02:00:09,835 --> 02:00:11,754
What's troubling you?

1115
02:00:15,007 --> 02:00:17,468
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1116
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:21,138
I don't know.

1117
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,308
I thought you'd seen him.

1118
02:00:25,726 --> 02:00:28,479
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1119
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:32,024
For the health of Rome,
the senate must be bled.

1120
02:00:33,526 --> 02:00:35,444
And he will bleed, too.

1121
02:00:35,528 --> 02:00:38,239
Very soon.

1122
02:00:39,448 --> 02:00:41,617
But not tonight.

1123
02:00:55,548 --> 02:00:57,967
Do you remember what
our father said once?

1124
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:02,138
"It's a dream-

1125
02:01:03,973 --> 02:01:06,517
a frightful dream-

1126
02:01:08,436 --> 02:01:10,604
Life is."

1127
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,650
Do you think that's true?

1128
02:01:14,734 --> 02:01:17,278
I don't know.

1129
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,158
I think it is.

1130
02:01:24,702 --> 02:01:27,371
And I have only you
to share it with.

1131
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:07,203
Open your mouth.

1132
02:02:43,531 --> 02:02:45,658
You know I love you.

1133
02:02:47,785 --> 02:02:50,037
And I love you.

1134
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:28,159
Out. Get out!

1135
02:03:28,242 --> 02:03:30,619
Move!

1136
02:03:34,749 --> 02:03:36,792
Congratulations, General.

1137
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:40,338
You've got very...
persuasive friends.

1138
02:03:45,676 --> 02:03:48,179
My brother's had
Gracchus arrested.

1139
02:03:48,262 --> 02:03:52,266
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1140
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:56,062
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1141
02:03:56,145 --> 02:03:58,939
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1142
02:04:01,692 --> 02:04:03,652
You have done all this?

1143
02:04:03,694 --> 02:04:06,572
- Yes.
- You risk too much.

1144
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:10,409
I have much to pay for.

1145
02:04:12,161 --> 02:04:14,080
You have nothing to pay for.

1146
02:04:14,163 --> 02:04:17,750
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1147
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:24,632
I am tired of being strong.

1148
02:04:24,715 --> 02:04:27,468
My brother hates all the world,

1149
02:04:27,551 --> 02:04:29,470
and you most of all.

1150
02:04:29,553 --> 02:04:33,432
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1151
02:04:34,517 --> 02:04:37,061
Because my father loved you.

1152
02:04:40,606 --> 02:04:43,442
And because I loved you.

1153
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:47,571
A long time ago.

1154
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:53,953
Was I very different then?

1155
02:05:00,668 --> 02:05:02,586
You laughed more.

1156
02:05:06,507 --> 02:05:10,136
I have felt alone all my life,

1157
02:05:10,219 --> 02:05:12,304
except with you.

1158
02:05:15,016 --> 02:05:16,934
I must go.

1159
02:05:17,018 --> 02:05:19,603
Yes.

1160
02:05:46,213 --> 02:05:48,341
There. There.

1161
02:05:48,424 --> 02:05:51,844
- There. There. There.
There. There. There.

1162
02:05:51,927 --> 02:05:54,055
There. There. There.

1163
02:05:54,138 --> 02:05:56,223
There. There. There.

1164
02:05:56,307 --> 02:05:58,809
- There. There. There. There.

1165
02:05:58,893 --> 02:06:00,811
And I've got you.

1166
02:06:03,481 --> 02:06:05,941
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1167
02:06:05,983 --> 02:06:08,361
I'm not a legionnaire.

1168
02:06:08,444 --> 02:06:10,613
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1169
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:16,077
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1170
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,245
Wouldn't you rather be...

1171
02:06:18,329 --> 02:06:20,498
a great Roman warrior
like Julius Caesar?

1172
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:23,668
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1173
02:06:25,294 --> 02:06:27,630
The savior of Rome?

1174
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:37,890
And who said that?

1175
02:06:46,482 --> 02:06:48,901
Where's Lucius?

1176
02:06:48,943 --> 02:06:50,903
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1177
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:57,785
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1178
02:06:57,868 --> 02:07:01,455
She took it from a basket
and pressed it to her breast,

1179
02:07:01,539 --> 02:07:03,457
right here above her heart.

1180
02:07:05,584 --> 02:07:07,837
It bit her in the breast?

1181
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,839
Yes.

1182
02:07:09,922 --> 02:07:12,967
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies...

1183
02:07:13,050 --> 02:07:16,846
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1184
02:07:16,929 --> 02:07:18,848
I think it's silly.

1185
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:20,850
So do I.

1186
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:24,311
So do I.

1187
02:07:24,353 --> 02:07:26,522
Sister, join us.

1188
02:07:26,605 --> 02:07:28,816
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1189
02:07:28,899 --> 02:07:31,610
- I've been reading too.
- Yes.

1190
02:07:31,652 --> 02:07:33,612
He's a very clever little boy.

1191
02:07:33,654 --> 02:07:36,782
He'll make a grand
emperor one day.

1192
02:07:36,824 --> 02:07:40,536
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1193
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:42,705
The queen killed herself
with a snake.

1194
02:07:42,788 --> 02:07:46,000
And just wait until you hear what
happened to our ancestors.

1195
02:07:46,083 --> 02:07:48,586
If you're very good,

1196
02:07:48,669 --> 02:07:52,715
tomorrow night I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1197
02:07:52,798 --> 02:07:55,509
He was betrayed...

1198
02:07:55,593 --> 02:07:57,845
by those closest to him.

1199
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:01,140
By his own blood.

1200
02:08:02,725 --> 02:08:05,227
They whispered in dark corners...

1201
02:08:05,269 --> 02:08:07,229
and went out late at night...

1202
02:08:07,271 --> 02:08:09,940
and conspired...

1203
02:08:10,024 --> 02:08:12,026
and conspired.

1204
02:08:13,569 --> 02:08:16,530
But the Emperor Claudius
knew that they were up to something.

1205
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,076
He knew they were
busy little bees.

1206
02:08:22,119 --> 02:08:25,873
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

1207
02:08:25,956 --> 02:08:28,501
and he looked at her...

1208
02:08:28,584 --> 02:08:30,503
and he said,

1209
02:08:31,587 --> 02:08:34,757
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1210
02:08:34,799 --> 02:08:36,759
busy little bee,

1211
02:08:38,803 --> 02:08:42,056
or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1212
02:08:42,139 --> 02:08:46,560
You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1213
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:52,274
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1214
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:56,654
The little bee had
wounded him more deeply...

1215
02:08:56,696 --> 02:08:59,865
than anyone else
could ever have done.

1216
02:09:01,283 --> 02:09:05,204
And what do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1217
02:09:05,287 --> 02:09:07,707
I don't know, Uncle.

1218
02:09:13,295 --> 02:09:15,548
The little bee
told him everything.

1219
02:09:55,254 --> 02:09:58,883
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1220
02:09:58,966 --> 02:10:00,885
Proximo!

1221
02:10:00,968 --> 02:10:04,430
Open the gates in the name
of the Emperor!

1222
02:10:04,513 --> 02:10:07,350
- Proximo!

1223
02:10:07,433 --> 02:10:10,061
Open the gates!

1224
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:18,652
Open the gates, Proximo!

1225
02:10:18,694 --> 02:10:21,822
Do you want to die, old man?

1226
02:10:21,864 --> 02:10:24,158
Here.

1227
02:10:24,241 --> 02:10:26,535
Everything is prepared.

1228
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:29,538
- It seems you've won your freedom.
- Proximo,

1229
02:10:29,622 --> 02:10:32,249
are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1230
02:10:32,333 --> 02:10:34,001
Ha!

1231
02:10:37,296 --> 02:10:41,175
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1232
02:10:41,258 --> 02:10:45,513
Open the gates!
The Emperor commands!

1233
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:51,560
Pull!

1234
02:10:53,521 --> 02:10:56,524
Move! Two columns on the left!

1235
02:10:59,652 --> 02:11:02,446
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1236
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:05,950
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1237
02:11:06,033 --> 02:11:07,952
We'll wait here for you,
Maximus.

1238
02:11:08,035 --> 02:11:10,913
- Strength and honor.
- Go!

1239
02:11:12,039 --> 02:11:14,959
Strength and honor.

1240
02:11:16,168 --> 02:11:19,714
Aim! Break the bars!

1241
02:12:25,946 --> 02:12:27,907
Shadows and dust.

1242
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:30,034
Aah!

1243
02:13:08,364 --> 02:13:10,700
- Maximus!

1244
02:13:15,371 --> 02:13:17,415
I'm sorry.

1245
02:13:17,498 --> 02:13:19,792
No!

1246
02:13:44,066 --> 02:13:45,985
It's done.

1247
02:13:52,658 --> 02:13:55,161
And what of my nephew?

1248
02:13:55,202 --> 02:13:57,663
And what of his mother?

1249
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:02,293
Should they share
her lover's fate?

1250
02:14:03,919 --> 02:14:06,380
Or should I be merciful?

1251
02:14:08,674 --> 02:14:11,093
Commodus the Merciful.

1252
02:14:17,141 --> 02:14:20,311
Lucius will stay with me now.

1253
02:14:20,394 --> 02:14:23,606
And if his mother...

1254
02:14:23,689 --> 02:14:27,068
so much as looks at me...

1255
02:14:27,151 --> 02:14:30,112
in a manner that displeases me,

1256
02:14:31,405 --> 02:14:33,366
he will die.

1257
02:14:36,494 --> 02:14:38,746
If she decides...

1258
02:14:38,788 --> 02:14:41,374
to be noble...

1259
02:14:41,457 --> 02:14:45,002
and takes her own life,

1260
02:14:45,086 --> 02:14:47,004
he will die.

1261
02:14:49,799 --> 02:14:51,717
And as for you,

1262
02:14:54,595 --> 02:14:57,181
you will love me...

1263
02:14:57,264 --> 02:14:59,392
as I loved you.

1264
02:15:00,643 --> 02:15:03,104
You will provide me
with an heir...

1265
02:15:03,145 --> 02:15:05,439
of pure blood...

1266
02:15:05,481 --> 02:15:08,484
so that Commodus
and his progeny...

1267
02:15:08,526 --> 02:15:10,986
will rule for a thousand years.

1268
02:15:15,116 --> 02:15:17,576
Am I not merciful?

1269
02:15:38,889 --> 02:15:41,308
Am I not merciful?

1270
02:15:53,529 --> 02:15:55,656
Maximus! Maximus!

1271
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,576
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

1272
02:15:58,617 --> 02:16:01,412
Maximus! Maximus!

1273
02:16:01,495 --> 02:16:03,748
Maximus! Maximus!

1274
02:16:03,831 --> 02:16:05,916
Maximus! Maximus!

1275
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:09,920
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

1276
02:16:09,962 --> 02:16:12,923
Maximus! Maximus!

1277
02:16:12,965 --> 02:16:15,676
Maximus! Maximus!

1278
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,304
Maximus! Maximus!

1279
02:16:18,387 --> 02:16:20,306
Maximus! Maximus!

1280
02:16:20,389 --> 02:16:22,767
Maximus! Maximus!

1281
02:16:22,808 --> 02:16:25,019
Maximus! Maximus!

1282
02:16:25,102 --> 02:16:28,356
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1283
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:31,442
Maximus! Maximus!

1284
02:16:31,525 --> 02:16:33,819
Maximus! Maximus!

1285
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:40,409
Maximus.

1286
02:16:40,493 --> 02:16:42,661
Maximus.

1287
02:16:42,745 --> 02:16:44,705
Maximus.

1288
02:16:45,915 --> 02:16:48,000
They call for you.

1289
02:16:49,627 --> 02:16:53,381
The general who became a slave.

1290
02:16:53,464 --> 02:16:56,717
The slave
who became a gladiator.

1291
02:16:57,968 --> 02:17:01,097
The gladiator
who defied an emperor.

1292
02:17:02,765 --> 02:17:05,393
A striking story.

1293
02:17:05,476 --> 02:17:08,437
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1294
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:13,192
Only a famous death will do.

1295
02:17:14,777 --> 02:17:17,738
And what could be
more glorious...

1296
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:21,742
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1297
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:26,414
You would fight me?

1298
02:17:26,455 --> 02:17:30,167
Why not?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1299
02:17:31,377 --> 02:17:34,171
I think you have been afraid
all your life.

1300
02:17:34,255 --> 02:17:38,384
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1301
02:17:44,015 --> 02:17:48,310
I knew a man who once said,
" Death smiles at us all.

1302
02:17:48,352 --> 02:17:51,522
All a man can do
is smile back."

1303
02:17:51,605 --> 02:17:54,275
I wonder.

1304
02:17:54,358 --> 02:17:56,777
Did your friend
smile at his own death?

1305
02:17:57,862 --> 02:17:59,780
You must know.

1306
02:18:02,199 --> 02:18:04,535
He was your father.

1307
02:18:07,872 --> 02:18:11,542
You loved my father, I know.

1308
02:18:11,625 --> 02:18:13,544
But so did I.

1309
02:18:14,628 --> 02:18:16,839
That makes us brothers,
doesn't it?

1310
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:21,927
Smile for me now, brother.

1311
02:18:25,765 --> 02:18:28,476
- Strap on his armor.

1312
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:31,270
Conceal the wound.

1313
02:18:37,026 --> 02:18:38,778
Maximus! Maximus!

1314
02:18:38,861 --> 02:18:41,614
Maximus! Maximus!

1315
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:25,991
Ring formation!

1316
02:19:26,075 --> 02:19:28,869
Ring formation!

1317
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:01,569
Off with his head, Maximus!

1318
02:21:05,758 --> 02:21:09,428
- Aah!

1319
02:21:17,019 --> 02:21:19,188
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1320
02:21:19,271 --> 02:21:21,649
Quintus, sword!

1321
02:21:21,691 --> 02:21:24,485
Give me your sword!

1322
02:21:26,487 --> 02:21:29,031
Sword! Give me a sword!

1323
02:21:29,115 --> 02:21:31,909
- Sheathe your swords!

1324
02:21:31,992 --> 02:21:34,995
Sheathe your swords!

1325
02:23:49,588 --> 02:23:51,507
Maximus.

1326
02:23:55,553 --> 02:23:59,056
- Maximus.
- Quintus.

1327
02:24:00,975 --> 02:24:03,894
Free my men.

1328
02:24:03,978 --> 02:24:06,522
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1329
02:24:07,606 --> 02:24:09,608
There was a dream that was Rome.

1330
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:13,487
It shall be realized.

1331
02:24:13,571 --> 02:24:16,115
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1332
02:24:16,198 --> 02:24:19,118
Free the prisoners!
Go!

1333
02:24:43,059 --> 02:24:44,977
Maximus!

1334
02:24:46,854 --> 02:24:49,148
Lucius is safe.

1335
02:25:04,663 --> 02:25:06,749
Go to them.

1336
02:25:54,922 --> 02:25:57,383
You're home.

1337
02:26:23,159 --> 02:26:26,579
Is Rome worth
one good man's life?

1338
02:26:29,707 --> 02:26:31,959
We believed it once.

1339
02:26:34,211 --> 02:26:36,172
Make us believe it again.

1340
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:43,012
He was a soldier of Rome.

1341
02:26:46,432 --> 02:26:48,768
Honor him.

1342
02:26:48,851 --> 02:26:51,270
Who will help me carry him?

1343
02:27:35,231 --> 02:27:37,692
Now we are free.

1344
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:45,616
I will see you again.

1345
02:27:47,743 --> 02:27:50,329
But not yet.

1346
02:27:50,371 --> 02:27:52,331
Not yet.
