1
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,744
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Berk.</font></b>

2
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 12 days north of hopeless and a
few degrees South of freezing to death.</font></b>

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,211
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's located solidly on
the meridian of misery.</font></b>

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,799
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">My village. In a word, sturdy.</font></b>

5
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,637
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.</font></b>

6
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We have fishing, hunting and a
charming view of the sunsets.</font></b>

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,019
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The only problems are the pests.</font></b>

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,441
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.</font></b>

9
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,776
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We have...</font></b>

10
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,072
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">dragons.</font></b>

11
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,659
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people would leave. Not us.</font></b>

12
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,455
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're Vikings. We have
stubbornness issues.</font></b>

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,624
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Hiccup.</font></b>

14
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,170
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Great name, I know. But
it's not the worst.</font></b>

15
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,007
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Parents believe a hideous name will
frighten off gnomes and trolls.</font></b>

16
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,509
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Like our charming Viking
demeanor wouldn't do that.</font></b>

17
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,678
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning!</font></b>

18
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,682
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!</font></b>

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,643
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!</font></b>

20
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,734
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup! What is he doing? What
are you doing out?! Get inside!</font></b>

21
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,529
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.</font></b>

22
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,534
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When he was a baby, he popped a
dragon's head clean off its shoulders.</font></b>

23
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,787
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I believe it? Yes, I do.</font></b>

24
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,954
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got?</font></b>

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,917
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.</font></b>

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.</font></b>

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,713
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font></b>

28
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,715
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hoist the torches!</font></b>

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,557
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice of you to join the party! I
thought you'd been carried off!</font></b>

30
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,562
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, me? No, come on, I'm way
too muscular for their taste.</font></b>

31
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,899
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They wouldn't know what
to do with all this.</font></b>

32
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,901
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They need toothpicks,
don't they?</font></b>

33
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The meathead with attitude and
interchangeable hands is Gobber.</font></b>

34
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,667
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been his apprentice
since I was little.</font></b>

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,910
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, littler.</font></b>

36
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:45,081
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Move to the lower defenses. We'll
counterattack with the catapults.</font></b>

37
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,374
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font></b>

38
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,753
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Old village, lots
and lots of new houses.</font></b>

39
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,255
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font></b>

40
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,714
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font></b>

41
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,469
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the
twins: Ruff nut and Tuffnut...</font></b>

42
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,221
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and...</font></b>

43
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,432
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Astrid.</font></b>

44
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,820
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Their job is so much cooler.</font></b>

45
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,366
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my Mark.</font></b>

46
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,452
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.</font></b>

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,454
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, 2 minutes.
I'll kill a dragon.</font></b>

48
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,791
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.</font></b>

49
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,627
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.</font></b>

50
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,337
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't even throw
one of these!</font></b>

51
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,676
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, fine, but this
will throw it for me.</font></b>

52
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,222
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!</font></b>

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,433
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!</font></b>

54
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,644
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever want to get out
there to fight dragons...</font></b>

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,814
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you need to stop all this.</font></b>

56
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,066
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But you just pointed
to all of me.</font></b>

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,612
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's it! Stop
being all of you.</font></b>

58
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,780
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font></b>

59
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,658
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You, sir, are playing
a dangerous game.</font></b>

60
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,829
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Keeping this much raw
Vikingness contained?</font></b>

61
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,664
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be consequences!</font></b>

62
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,293
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take my chances. Sword.
Sharpen. Now.</font></b>

63
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:18,007
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...</font></b>

64
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,009
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">is everything around here.</font></b>

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Nadder head is sure to
get me at least noticed.</font></b>

66
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,265
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gronckles are tough.</font></b>

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,685
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking down one of those would
definitely get me a girlfriend.</font></b>

68
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,812
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Zippleback?</font></b>

69
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,775
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Exotic. Two heads,
twice the status.</font></b>

70
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,193
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They found the sheep!</font></b>

71
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,528
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Concentrate fire
over the lower bank.</font></b>

72
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,364
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hurry up!
- Fire!</font></b>

73
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,700
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And then there's the
Monstrous Nightmare.</font></b>

74
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,745
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the best Vikings
go after those.</font></b>

75
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,874
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They have this nasty habit of
setting themselves on fire.</font></b>

76
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,212
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reload! I'll take care of this.</font></b>

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,717
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But the ultimate prize is the
dragon no one's ever seen.</font></b>

78
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,886
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- We call it the...
- Night Fury!</font></b>

79
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,388
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font></b>

80
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,892
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump!</font></b>

81
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,438
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...</font></b>

82
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,692
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">never misses.</font></b>

83
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,613
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.</font></b>

84
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,908
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.</font></b>

85
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,287
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay. Put. There.</font></b>

86
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,457
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean.</font></b>

87
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,086
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!</font></b>

88
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,629
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hiccup!
- Be right back!</font></b>

89
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,761
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get him!</font></b>

90
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,763
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind yourselves!</font></b>

91
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,932
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The devils still have
some juice in them!</font></b>

92
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,279
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.</font></b>

93
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,637
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I hit it. Yes, I hit it!</font></b>

94
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,848
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did anybody see that?</font></b>

95
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,517
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Except for you.</font></b>

96
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,901
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do not let them escape!
- Right!</font></b>

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,338
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all out.</font></b>

98
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,013
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and there's one more
thing you need to know.</font></b>

99
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,484
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Dad.</font></b>

100
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,703
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, but I hit a Night Fury.</font></b>

101
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,291
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!</font></b>

102
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys were busy. I
had a very clear shot.</font></b>

103
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,381
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...</font></b>

104
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,841
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font></b>

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,051
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stop.</font></b>

106
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,429
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time you step
outside, disaster follows.</font></b>

107
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,640
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you not see that I
have bigger problems?</font></b>

108
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,394
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Winter is almost here and I
have an entire village to feed!</font></b>

109
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,649
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Between you and me, the village could
do with a little less feeding.</font></b>

110
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,734
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a joke, Hiccup!</font></b>

111
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,071
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?</font></b>

112
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,868
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stop myself. I see a
dragon and I have to just kill it.</font></b>

113
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,036
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's who I am, Dad.</font></b>

114
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:21,417
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're many things, Hiccup. But a
dragon killer is not one of them.</font></b>

115
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,377
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back to the house.</font></b>

116
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,504
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure he gets there.</font></b>

117
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,299
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have his mess to clean up.</font></b>

118
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,551
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite the performance.</font></b>

119
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,512
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen anyone mess up that badly.
That helped.</font></b>

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,307
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, thank you.
I was trying.</font></b>

121
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,770
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.</font></b>

122
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,190
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.</font></b>

123
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When he does, it's with
this disappointed scowl,</font></b>

124
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,695
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">like someone skimped on
meat in his sandwich.</font></b>

125
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,908
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Excuse me, barmaid. You brought
me the wrong offspring."</font></b>

126
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,829
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.</font></b>

127
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,749
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"This here, this is a
talking fishbone."</font></b>

128
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,959
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're thinking
about this wrong.</font></b>

129
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,589
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.</font></b>

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,133
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for summing that up.</font></b>

131
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,512
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, the point is, stop trying so
hard to be something you're not.</font></b>

132
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,015
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to be
one of you guys.</font></b>

133
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,111
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!</font></b>

134
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,822
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.</font></b>

135
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,991
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we find the nest
and destroy it,</font></b>

136
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,328
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!</font></b>

137
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,997
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">One more search before
the ice sets in.</font></b>

138
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,166
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Those ships never come back.</font></b>

139
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,796
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
Now who's with me?!</font></b>

140
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:49,964
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Count me out.</font></b>

141
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,332
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.</font></b>

142
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,511
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.</font></b>

143
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,263
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- To the ships!
- I'm with you!</font></b>

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,514
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more like it.</font></b>

145
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,850
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pack my undies.</font></b>

146
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,937
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I need you to stay and
train some new recruits.</font></b>

147
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,525
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.</font></b>

148
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,861
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.</font></b>

149
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,030
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What could possibly go wrong?</font></b>

150
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,324
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I going to
do with him, Gobber?</font></b>

151
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,826
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put him in training.</font></b>

152
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,203
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.</font></b>

153
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,206
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd be killed before the first
dragon is out of its cage.</font></b>

154
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,958
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.</font></b>

155
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,584
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you don't.
- No, I do.</font></b>

156
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,961
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't.</font></b>

157
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,879
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, you know what he's like.</font></b>

158
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,009
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.</font></b>

159
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't listen. He has the
attention span of a sparrow.</font></b>

160
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I take him fishing and he
goes hunting for trolls!</font></b>

161
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,061
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trolls exist. They
steal your socks.</font></b>

162
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,231
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But only the left ones.
What's with that?</font></b>

163
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.</font></b>

164
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,694
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">My father told me to bang my
head against a rock and I did it.</font></b>

165
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,655
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was crazy, but
I didn't question him.</font></b>

166
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,991
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.</font></b>

167
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,118
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That rock split in two.</font></b>

168
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,371
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It taught me what a
Viking could do, Gobber.</font></b>

169
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,542
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!</font></b>

170
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,756
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even as a boy, I knew what I
was, what I had to become.</font></b>

171
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,425
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup is not that boy.</font></b>

172
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,886
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't stop him, Stoick.</font></b>

173
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,221
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can only prepare him.</font></b>

174
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,601
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.</font></b>

175
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,855
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.</font></b>

176
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,292
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the gods hate me.</font></b>

177
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,629
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.</font></b>

178
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,799
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I manage to lose
an entire dragon.</font></b>

179
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,308
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow. I did it.</font></b>

180
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,396
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I did it. This fixes everything!
Yes!</font></b>

181
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,898
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have brought down
this mighty beast!</font></b>

182
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,304
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to kill you, dragon.</font></b>

183
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,725
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.</font></b>

184
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a Viking. I am a Viking!</font></b>

185
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,306
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I did this.</font></b>

186
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,631
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup.</font></b>

187
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,508
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad...</font></b>

188
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,177
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to talk to you, Dad.</font></b>

189
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to speak
with you, too, son.</font></b>

190
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,392
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.</font></b>

191
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What?</font></b>

192
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,438
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- You go first.
- No, you go first.</font></b>

193
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,689
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font></b>

194
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,193
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.</font></b>

195
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,362
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man, I should
have gone first.</font></b>

196
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,281
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking, you know,</font></b>

197
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,451
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">we have a surplus of
dragon-fighting Vikings,</font></b>

198
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,205
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?</font></b>

199
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,373
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll need this.</font></b>

200
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,751
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to fight dragons.</font></b>

201
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,336
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Yes, you do.</font></b>

202
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,381
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rephrase. Dad, I
can't kill dragons.</font></b>

203
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,342
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But you will kill dragons.</font></b>

204
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,511
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm really very
extra-sure that I won't.</font></b>

205
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,555
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?</font></b>

206
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,891
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is serious, son.</font></b>

207
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,313
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you carry this axe, you
carry all of us with you.</font></b>

208
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,150
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means you walk like
us, you talk like us...</font></b>

209
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,194
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you think like us.</font></b>

210
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,529
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No more of... this.</font></b>

211
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,657
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You just gestured to all of me.</font></b>

212
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,118
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.</font></b>

213
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,578
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal?</font></b>

214
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,581
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal.</font></b>

215
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,209
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font></b>

216
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,087
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Train hard.</font></b>

217
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,756
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back. Probably.</font></b>

218
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,467
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'll be here.</font></b>

219
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font></b>

220
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,764
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to dragon training!</font></b>

221
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,350
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No turning back.</font></b>

222
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope I get some serious burns.</font></b>

223
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,373
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.</font></b>

224
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,792
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's only fun if you
get a scar out of it.</font></b>

225
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,210
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no kidding, right?</font></b>

226
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,379
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pain. Love it.</font></b>

227
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,256
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great. Who let him in?</font></b>

228
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,134
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get started! The
recruit who does best</font></b>

229
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,928
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">will win the honor of
killing his first dragon</font></b>

230
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,805
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of the entire village.</font></b>

231
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,476
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?</font></b>

232
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,146
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?</font></b>

233
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,316
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.</font></b>

234
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,235
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll see you
as sick or insane</font></b>

235
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,572
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.</font></b>

236
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,284
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species</font></b>

237
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,452
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you will learn to fight!</font></b>

238
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,121
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.</font></b>

239
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,622
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hideous Zippleback.</font></b>

240
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,166
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.</font></b>

241

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.</font></b>

242

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.</font></b>

243
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,380
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you stop that?!</font></b>

244
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,425
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Gronckle.</font></b>

245
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,677
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jaw strength 8.</font></b>

246
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,365
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, aren't you gonna
teach us first?</font></b>

247
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,015
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe in
learning on the job.</font></b>

248
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,853
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...</font></b>

249
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">you're dead!</font></b>

250
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,940
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the first
thing you'll need?</font></b>

251
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,859
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?</font></b>

252
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,236
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- A shield.
- Shields. Go!</font></b>

253
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,698
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Your most important piece of
equipment is your shield!</font></b>

254
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,869
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you must choose between a sword
or a shield, take the shield!</font></b>

255

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!</font></b>

256
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,286
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that one. It has a flower...

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oops, this one has blood on it.</font></b>

258
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,671
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tuffnut, Ruff nut! You're out!
- What?</font></b>

259
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Shields are good
for another thing.</font></b>

260
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,928
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Noise! Make lots of it to
throw off a dragon's aim!</font></b>

00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,723
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All dragons have a

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have passed the word,</font></b>

377

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">because it wasn't a month before

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it weird to think your
hand was inside a dragon?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll chop off the legs of every
dragon I fight, with my face.</font></b>

383
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,442
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wings and the
tails you really want.</font></b>

384

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If it can't fly,
it can't get away.</font></b>

385

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A downed dragon

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.</font></b>

Monstrous Nightmare.</font></b>

389
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,839
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But who'll win the
honor of killing it?</font></b>

390
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,259
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be me. It's my destiny.
See?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Mom let you get a tattoo?</font></b>

392

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.</font></b>

some nice Icelandic COD...</font></b>

400

No, it's OK.</font></b>

463
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,095
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Most afternoons, but who can blame him?
The life of a celebrity's rough.</font></b>

464

488

489
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,636

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font></b>

493

529

00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,197
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Late for what, exactly?</font></b>

535
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet down! The

547
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,712
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Training?</font></b>

548
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,505
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It better not involve this.</font></b>

549
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,301
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this looks really
bad, but you see...</font></b>

550
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,680
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. You're right.
You're right.</font></b>

551
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:45,977
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm through with the lies. I've
been making outfits. So you got me.</font></b>

552
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:50,273
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time everyone knew. Drag
me back, go ahead. Here we go.</font></b>

553
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,400
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you do that?!</font></b>

554
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:56,988
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for the lies. And
that's for everything else.</font></b>

555
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:58,782
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font></b>

556
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,242

557
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,579

558

562

563
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,598
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Astrid, Toothless.
Toothless, Astrid.</font></b>

564
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,897

This is it!</font></b>

567
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,256
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup, get me down from here!</font></b>

568
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,591
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to give me a
chance to explain.</font></b>

569
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,427
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not listening to
anything you have to say!</font></b>

570
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,056
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.</font></b>

571
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,976
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Astrid.</font></b>

572
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,034
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now get me down.</font></b>

573
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,954
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Toothless, down. Gently.</font></b>

574
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,458
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Nothing to be afraid of.</font></b>

575
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,338
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Toothless!</font></b>

576
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,342
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong with you?!
Bad dragon!</font></b>

Oh, no.</font></b>

578
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,022
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!</font></b>

579
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,027
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And now the spinning.</font></b>

580
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:03,072
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.</font></b>

581
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,826
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.</font></b>

582
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,828
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get me off of this thing.</font></b>

583
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,230
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.</font></b>

584
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,108

585
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,985
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's amazing.</font></b>

586
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,781
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So what now?</font></b>

587
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,784
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup, your final
exam is tomorrow.</font></b>

588
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,078
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you'll have to kill...</font></b>

589
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,788
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">kill a dragon.</font></b>

590
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,665
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't remind me.</font></b>

591

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Toothless, what's happening?</font></b>

592
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,088
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font></b>

593
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,967
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font></b>

594
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,986
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- I don't know.</font></b>

595
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,156
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Toothless, you gotta get
us out of here, bud.</font></b>

596
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,119
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like they're
hauling in their kill.</font></b>

597
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,830
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that make us?</font></b>

598
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,251
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What my Dad wouldn't
give to find this.</font></b>

599
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,646
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.</font></b>

600
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,649
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not eating any of it.</font></b>

601
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,749
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font></b>

602
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:33,885
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, bud, we got to
get out of here... now!</font></b>

603
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,064
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.</font></b>

604
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,233
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're the workers and
that's their queen.</font></b>

605
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,944
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It controls them.
Let's find your Dad.</font></b>

606
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,362
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No.</font></b>

607
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:57,783
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not yet. They'll
kill Toothless.</font></b>

608
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,661
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to think this
through carefully.</font></b>

609
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:03,748
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,</font></b>

610
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,626
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">the thing we've been after since
Vikings first sailed here,</font></b>

611
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,086
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and you want to
keep it a secret?</font></b>

612
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,173
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?</font></b>

613
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,509
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

614
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,478
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK. Then what do we do?</font></b>

615
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:29,398
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.</font></b>

616
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,317
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK.</font></b>

617
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,153
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for kidnapping me.</font></b>

618
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,871
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for everything else.</font></b>

619
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,049
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you looking at?</font></b>

620
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,929
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!</font></b>

621
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:06,143
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can show my face
in public again!</font></b>

622
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,565
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks.</font></b>

623
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:16,320
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup would go from,
well, being Hiccup</font></b>

624
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:20,992
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast</font></b>

625
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,744
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and shipped him off for
fear he'd gone mad!</font></b>

626
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,746
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know it!</font></b>

627
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:32,712
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But here we are. And no
one is more surprised</font></b>

628
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,881
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">or more proud than I am.</font></b>

629
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,802
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, my boy becomes a Viking.</font></b>

630
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,180
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, he becomes one of us!</font></b>

631
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,061
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful with that dragon.</font></b>

632
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,648
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

633
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,901
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put an end to this.
I have to try.</font></b>

634
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,031
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Astrid, if something goes wrong,</font></b>

635
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,241

don't find Toothless.</font></b>

636
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,454
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I will. Just promise
me it won't go wrong.</font></b>

637
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,458
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time, Hiccup.
Knock 'em dead.</font></b>

638
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,466
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.</font></b>

639
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,886
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!</font></b>

640
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,941
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have gone
for the hammer.</font></b>

641
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,280
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready.</font></b>

642
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,932
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!</font></b>

643
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,687
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he doing?</font></b>

644
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,110
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, it's OK. It's OK.</font></b>

645
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not one of them.</font></b>

646
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,542
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he thinking?</font></b>

647
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,585
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop the fight.
- No!</font></b>

648
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,463
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you all to see this.</font></b>

649
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,508
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not what

650
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,677

651
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,389
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, stop the fight!</font></b>

652
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,148

654

A lie?</font></b>

Toothless did.</font></b>

01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,988
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. No, Dad. No, please,
it's not what you think.</font></b>

686
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:54,199
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.</font></b>

687
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:58,287
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!</font></b>

688
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,497
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Dad. No.</font></b>

689
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,626
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">For once in your life, would
you please just listen to me?!</font></b>

690
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,175
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.</font></b>

691
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,304
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not my son.</font></b>

692
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,767
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready the ships!</font></b>

693
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,988
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font></b>

694
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,865
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Set sail!</font></b>

695
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,618
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We head for Helheim's Gate.</font></b>

696
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,462
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lead us home, devil.</font></b>

697
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,860
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mess.</font></b>

698
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,448
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:</font></b>

699
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,492
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.</font></b>

700
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,828
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for summing that up.</font></b>

701
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:08,167
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why couldn't I have killed that
dragon when I found him in the woods?</font></b>

702
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:12,629
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.</font></b>

703
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,340
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So why didn't you?</font></b>

704
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,804
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.</font></b>

705
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,682
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.</font></b>

706
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,143
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?</font></b>

707
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,521
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I want to remember
what you say right now.</font></b>

708
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,200
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak.</font></b>

709
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:34,735
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't kill a dragon.</font></b>

710
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,153
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You said "wouldn't".</font></b>

711
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,489
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever! I wouldn't!</font></b>

712
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:42,534
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.</font></b>

713
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,957
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">First one to ride one, though.</font></b>

714
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,419
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font></b>

715
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,759
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't kill him because he
looked as frightened as I was.</font></b>

716
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:03,430
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I looked at him
and I saw myself.</font></b>

717
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:09,937
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?</font></b>

718
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:15,901
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.</font></b>

719
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,530
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then something crazy.</font></b>

720
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,533
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more like it.</font></b>

721
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,253
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.</font></b>

722
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,922
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here!
- One length to your stern.</font></b>

723
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:42,302
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them</font></b>

724
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:46,098
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">are wondering what it is we're up to here.
Not me, of course.</font></b>

725
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,767
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,</font></b>

726
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,437
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">not me, are wondering if there
is in fact a plan at all</font></b>

727
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:56,233
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.</font></b>

728
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,527
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Send them running.</font></b>

729
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:01,446
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.</font></b>

730
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,040
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Step aside.</font></b>

731
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,513
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bear to port.</font></b>

732
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:35,814
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.</font></b>

733
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:40,986
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You were wise to seek help from
the world's most deadly weapon.</font></b>

734
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,154
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me.</font></b>

735
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,698
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I love this plan.
- I didn't...</font></b>

736
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,743
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're crazy. I like that.</font></b>

737
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,579
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what is the plan?</font></b>

738
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,507
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not really encouraging.</font></b>

739
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,970
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was wondering where that went.</font></b>

740
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:22,194
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay low and ready your weapons.</font></b>

741
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,169
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here.</font></b>

742
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,621
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.</font></b>

743
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,999
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's OK. It's OK.</font></b>

744
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,678
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font></b>

745
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,472
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll need something
to help you hold on.</font></b>

746
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:45,736
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">When we crack this Mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.</font></b>

747
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,864
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In my undies. Good thing
I brought extras.</font></b>

748
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,284
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how this
ends, it ends today.</font></b>

749
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,007
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that it?</font></b>

750
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,013
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We've done it!</font></b>

751
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:08,068
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't over! Form your ranks!
Hold together!</font></b>

752
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,874
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get clear!</font></b>

753
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,928
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beard of Thor! What is that?!</font></b>

754
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,017
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Odin help us.</font></b>

755
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:46,898
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Catapults!</font></b>

756
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,952
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get to the ships!
- No! No!</font></b>

757
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,758
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.</font></b>

758
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,094
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lead the men to the far
side of the island!</font></b>

759
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,429
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gobber, go with the men!</font></b>

760
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:20,557
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.</font></b>

761
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,852
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can buy them a few minutes if I
give that thing someone to hunt!</font></b>

762
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,562
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I can double that time.</font></b>

763
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,610
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!</font></b>

764
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,915
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Fight me!</font></b>

765
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,958
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, me!</font></b>

766
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,800
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!</font></b>

767
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,136
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, Fishlegs!</font></b>

768
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:02,140
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!</font></b>

769
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,102
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Up! Let's move it!</font></b>

770
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:11,024
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!</font></b>

771
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,444
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.</font></b>

772
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,405
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!</font></b>

773
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,563
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Steer clear of both. Small
eyes, large nostrils!</font></b>

774
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,576
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Relies on hearing and smell!</font></b>

775
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:25,121
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind
spot, make noise, keep it confused!</font></b>

776
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:29,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has
a shot limit! Make it mad!</font></b>

777
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,543
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my specialty!</font></b>

778
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,005
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.</font></b>

779
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,425
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just do what I told you! I'll
be back as soon as I can!</font></b>

780
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,345
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!</font></b>

781
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,397
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Troll!
- Butt elf!</font></b>

782
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,107
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bride of Grendel!</font></b>

783
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,365
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing doesn't
have a blind spot!</font></b>

784
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There!</font></b>

785
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,795
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Go help the others!</font></b>

786
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,048
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, hold on. Hold on.</font></b>

787
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,471
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!</font></b>

788
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:36,484
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!</font></b>

789
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,448
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm OK!</font></b>

790
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,074
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Less OK!</font></b>

791
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:49,456
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! You're the Viking!</font></b>

793
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,209
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font></b>

794
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,396
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it, bud.</font></b>

795
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,358
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiccup!</font></b>

796
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:04,072

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Me, too.</font></b>

798
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,617

799
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:11,663
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're Vikings. It's an

800
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud to call you my son.</font></b>

801

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Dad.</font></b>

802

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's up!</font></b>

803
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,223
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Snotlout out of there.</font></b>

804
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,641
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm on it!

805
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,370
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, let me drive!

808
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,153
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe that worked!</font></b>

809
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,703
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Night Fury!</font></b>

810
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,621
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font></b>

813
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:20,607
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing has wings. OK,
let's see if it can use them!</font></b>

814
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,583
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You think that did it?</font></b>

815
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,256
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he can fly.</font></b>

816
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,821
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, Toothless,
time to disappear.</font></b>

817

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out!</font></b>

820

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, time's up! Let's

821
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,935
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Is that the

Just a bit longer.</font></b>

You think it'll do?</font></b>

here are even more so.</font></b>
