00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,975
confused out there.

179
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,396
Power, ideals, the old morality,

180
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,148
and practical
military necessity.

181
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,611
But out there with
these natives,

182
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,699
it must be a temptation

183
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:26,743
to be God.

184
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:33,709
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart

185
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,671
between the rational
and the irrational,

186
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:40,382
between good and evil.

187
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:44,261
And good does not
always triumph.

188
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,181
Sometimes

189
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,518
the dark side

190
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:56,565
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

191
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,902
Every man has got
a breaking point.

192
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,530
You and I have them.

193
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,367
Walt Kurtz has reached his,

194
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:12,080
and very obviously
he has gone insane.

195
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:29,222
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

196
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,439
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a Navy patrol boat,

197
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,235
pick up Colonel Kurtz's
path at Nu Mung Ba,

198
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,572
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

199
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,492
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team

200
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,161
by whatever means available

201
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,081
and terminate the
Colonel's command.

202
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,798
Terminate the Colonel?

203
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:08,303
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

204
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:14,101
totally beyond the pale of any
acceptable human conduct.

205
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:17,437
And he is still in the
field, commanding troops.

206
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,275
Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

207
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:27,447
You understand, Captain, that
this mission does not exist,

208
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,118
nor will it ever exist.

209
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,134
How many people had
I already killed?

210
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,138
There were those six that
I knew about for sure.

211
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,184
Close enough to blow their
last breath in my face.

212
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,483
But this time it was an
American and an officer.

213
00:19:56,037 --> 00:20:00,373
That wasn't supposed to make any
difference to me, but it did.

214
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,463
Shit, charging a man with
murder in this place

215
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,133
was like handing out speeding
tickets at the Indy 500.

216
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,389
I took the mission. What the
hell else was I gonna do?

217
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,895
But I really didn't know what
I'd do when I found him.

218
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:31,238
Did you check the tank?

219
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:33,031
Yeah.

220
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:38,245
I was being ferried down
the coast in a Navy PBR.

221
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:42,707
A type of plastic patrol boat, a
pretty common sight on the rivers.

222
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,418
They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move

223
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,754
without drawing a
lot of attention.

224
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,756
And that was okay.

225
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,175
I needed the air and the time.

226
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:55,428
Only problem was, I
wouldn’t be alone.

227
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:57,347
Morning, Captain.

228
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,644
The crew were mostly just kids.

229
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,106
Rock 'n' rollers with one
foot in their graves.

230
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,526
-How old are you?
-Seventeen.

231
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,322
The machinist, the one they called
Chef, was from New Orleans.

232
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,950
He was wrapped too
tight for Vietnam.

233
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,786
Probably wrapped too
tight for New Orleans.

234
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:22,565
Lance, on the forward
.50s, was a famous surfer

235
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,942
from the beaches south of LA.

236
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:28,654
To look at him, you wouldn’t believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

237
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:35,119
Clean, Mr. Clean, was from
some South Bronx shithole,

238
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,288
and I think the light
and space of Vietnam

239
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:39,623
really put the zap on his head.

240
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:44,879
Then there was
Phillips, the Chief.

241
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:48,883
It might have been my mission, but it
sure as shit was the Chief's boat.

242
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,218
There's about two points where
we can draw enough water

243
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,345
to get into the Nung River.

244
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,181
They're both hot,
belong to Charlie.

245
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,351
Don't worry about it.

246
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,687
Don't smoke.

247
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,775
You know, I’ve pulled a
few special ops in here.

248
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,861
About six months ago,

249
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:12,781
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

250
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:15,993
He was regular Army, too.

251
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:21,123
I heard he shot
himself in the head.

252
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:34,006
At first, I thought they
handed me the wrong dossier.

253
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,515
I couldn't believe they
wanted this man dead.

254
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,347
Third generation West Point,

255
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,411
top of his class,
Korea, Airborne,

256
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:45,889
about a thousand decorations,

257
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,619
et cetera, et cetera.

258
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:52,526
I'd heard his voice on the tape,

259
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:55,032
and it really put
the hook in me,

260
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,092
but I couldn't connect
up that voice

261
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,694
with this man.

262
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:09,712
Like they said, he had
an impressive career,

263
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,216
maybe too impressive.

264
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,218
I mean perfect.

265
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:18,751
He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation,

266
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,671
General, Chief of
Staff, anything.

267
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:28,051
In 1964, he returned from a tour
with advisory command in Vietnam

268
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,181
and things started to slip.

269
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:34,811
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

270
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,902
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.

271
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,691
During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer

272
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:49,031
to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.

273
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:53,201
Airborne?

274
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:57,711
He was 38 years old.

275
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,881
Why the fuck would he do that?

276
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:07,511
1966, joins Special Forces,

277
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,011
returns Vietnam.

278
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:13,961
-Hey, what's that?
-Arc light.

279
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,971
-What's that?
-B-52 strike.

280
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,841
Man.

281
00:24:18,931 --> 00:24:20,301
-What's that?
-Arc light.

282
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,431
I hate that. Every time I hear
that, something terrible happens.

283
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:25,521
Charlie, don't never see
them or hear them, man.

284
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,851
-There they are.
-Concussion will suck the air

285
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:29,271
out of your damn lungs.

286
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,981
-Something terrible is gonna happen.
-Smoke!

287
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,821
Secondary burning.

288
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,781
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

289
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:37,901
Let's have a look, Chief.

290
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,161
It was the air cav,
First of the Ninth.

291
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:45,701
That's them.

292
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,121
Our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.

293
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:52,001
But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 km ahead.

294
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:56,841
Well, Airmobile, those boys
just couldn't stay put.

295
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:12,481
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

296
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,241
First of the Ninth was
an old cavalry division

297
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:29,871
that had cashed in its horses for
choppers and gone tear-assing around Nam

298
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,751
looking for the shit.

299
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:36,131
They'd given Charlie a few
surprises in their time here.

300
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:40,681
But what they were mopping up now,
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

301
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,261
Just keep running by.
Run for television.

302
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:46,761
Don't look at the camera. Just keep...
Go on! Keep going.

303
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:48,431
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

304
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:49,601
Don't look at the camera.

305
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,891
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

306
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:54,651
Don't look at the camera. It's
for television. Just go through!

307
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,281
Go through! Just go by!
Keep on going!

308
00:25:57,361 --> 00:26:01,201
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

309
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,801
Where can I find the CO?

310
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,181
That's the Colonel coming down!

311
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:39,691
The CO's on that chopper.

312
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,141
Lieutenant, bomb that tree
line back about 100 yards!

313
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:09,761
-Give me some room to breathe!
-Yes, sir!

314
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,561
-Body cards!
-Sir?

315
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:18,771
-Bring my body cards!
-Yes, sir!

316
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,401
I'm the fourth tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

317
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,451
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

318
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,991
Captain Willard!

319
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,871
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

320
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:37,631
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you
on the requirements of my mission.

321
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,381
What mission? I haven't
heard from Nha Trang.

322
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:43,211
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

323
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,221
-We'll see what we can do, but...
-Colonel.

324
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,462
Just stay out of my way until
this is done, Captain.

325
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:55,891
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

326
00:27:55,981 --> 00:28:00,021
A two of spades, three of
spades, four of diamonds,

327
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:03,821
six of clubs, eight of spades.

328
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:07,161
There isn't one worth a
jack in the whole bunch.

329
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:08,991
Four of diamonds.

330
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,911
-Hey, Captain, what's that?
-Death cards!

331
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:17,081
-What?
-Death cards!

332
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:19,831
-Death?
-It lets Charlie know who did this.

333
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,091
-Cheer up, son.
-We will not hurt or harm you.

334
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,801
-Fire in the hole!
-Fire in the hole!

335
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:37,021
This is an area that is controlled by
the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

336
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,151
We are here to help you.

337
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:50,741
-We are here to extend a welcome hand...
-Come on.

338
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:52,871
To those of you who would like...
Everybody in?

339
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:56,541
To return to the arms of the
South Vietnamese government.

340
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:59,671
Hurry up!

341
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,251
Move it out!

342
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:09,051
This is an area that is controlled by
the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

343
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,391
Hey! What's this?

344
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,891
What is this?

345
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,971
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

346
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,311
About the only thing that's
holding his guts in, sir,

347
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,901
-is that pot lid.
-Yeah?

348
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:22,611
What does he have to say?

349
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,361
This soldier is dirty VC.

350
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,821
He wants water. He can
drink paddy water.

351
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:32,621
Get out of here! Give
me that canteen.

352
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,581
-He's VC!
-Any man that's brave enough to...

353
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:38,501
Get out of here! I'll
kick your fucking ass!

354
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:40,001
He killed a lot of our people!

355
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,921
Any man brave enough to fight
with his guts strapped on him

356
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,841
can drink from my
canteen any day!

357
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,711
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

358
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,591
-Where? Here? You sure?
-Down there.

359
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,511
Yeah? Here.

360
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,851
Repeat, we have a body count.
We have...

361
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,861
What's your name, sailor?
-Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir!

362
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:08,071
-Gunner's Mate Third Class...
-Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

363
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:11,701
-Yes, sir.
-Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.

364
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:14,121
I've admired your nose
riding for years.

365
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:17,161
I like your cutback, too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

366
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:19,951
-Thank you, sir.
-You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

367
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,041
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

368
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,131
-This guy with you?
-Yeah.

369
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,461
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

370
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,171
-Far out.
-Johnny from Malibu.

371
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,381
-John, hi. Far out.
-Pretty solid surfers.

372
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:33,261
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

373
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:34,761
No way.

374
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:38,601
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

375
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,811
fly down to Vung Tau
for the evening glass.

376
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:44,326
-Been riding since you got here?
-No way.

377
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,481
I haven't surfed
since I been here.

378
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:50,781
Through Christ our Lord, from
whom all good things come.

379
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,701
Through him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit,

380
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:57,451
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

381
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:01,501
Let us pray with confidence to the
Father in the words our savior gave us.

382
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:06,041
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

383
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:08,751
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done

384
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,961
on Earth as it is in heaven.

385
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,171
Give us this day
our daily bread...

386
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,101
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

387
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,641
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

388
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:34,701
Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself.

389
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,111
They choppered in the
T-bones and the beer

390
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:39,621
and turned the LZ
into a beach party.

391
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,541
The more they tried to
make it just like home,

392
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:46,171
the more they made
everybody miss it.

393
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:49,631
Make my meat rare,
rare but not cold!

394
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,261
Well, he wasn't a bad
officer, I guess.

395
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:02,601
He loved his boys and
you felt safe with him.

396
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:06,271
He was one of those guys that had
that weird light around him.

397
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:09,691
You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.

398
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:13,611
What happened to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

399
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,331
Airborne.

400
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:28,371
Sir, two places we can
get into the river...

401
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,171
Yeah... Here and here.

402
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,711
It's a pretty wide delta, but
these are the only two spots

403
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,051
I'm really sure of.

404
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:39,301
Well, that village you're pointing
at is kind of hairy, Willard.

405
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,051
-What do you mean "hairy," sir?
-It's hairy,

406
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,891
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

407
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,771
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

408
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:49,311
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

409
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,561
-Dop.
-Dop or Lop?

410
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,781
Damn gook names all
sound the same.

411
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:59,491
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

412
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:01,371
That's a fantastic peak.

413
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:04,081
-Peak?
-About six foot.

414
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:07,371
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak. It's
got both the long right and left slide

415
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:09,581
with a bowl section.
It's unbelievable.

416
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,751
It's just tube city.

417
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:17,551
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

418
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:20,181
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

419
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:22,221
It's all goddamn beach break.

420
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,311
It's really hairy in there, sir.
That's where we lost McDonald.

421
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:25,791
They shot the hell
out of us there.

422
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,481
That's Charlie's point.

423
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:32,401
Sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

424
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,561
There's always a good offshore
breeze in the morning.

425
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:36,651
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

426
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,201
The draft at the mouth of that
river may be too shallow.

427
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:43,636
We'll pick your boat up and put it down
like a baby, right where you want it.

428
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:46,831
This is the First of the Ninth
air cav, son. Airmobile.

429
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:50,306
I can take that point and hold
it just as long as I like.

430
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:53,501
And you can get any place up that
river that suits you, young Captain.

431
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,711
Hell, a six-foot peak.

432
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,642
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

433
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,801
Lance, go with Mike and let
him pick out a board for you,

434
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:03,641
and bring me my Yater
Spoon, the 8'6".

435
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:06,221
-I don't know, sir, it's...
-What is it, soldier?

436
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:09,141
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

437
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:11,231
Charlie don't surf!

438
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:38,211
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

439
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:42,721
Hey, man! They're
picking up the boat!

440
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:49,391
-How are you feeling, Jimmy?
-Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

441
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,521
All right, son, let her rip.

442
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,311
Let's go!

443
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:22,231
I never have gotten used to a light
board, and I can't get used to one.

444
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,941
-I'm used to a heavy board.
-I know, it's a real drag.

445
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,491
-You prefer a heavy or a light board?
-Heavier.

446
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:29,781
-Really?
-Yeah!

447
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:31,911
I thought all the young
guys like lighter boards.

448
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,201
You can't ride the
nose on those things.

449
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,621
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

450
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:41,091
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

451
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:42,801
Assume attack formation.

452
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,591
That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.

453
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:49,591
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

454
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,721
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

455
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:54,521
-Music?
-Yeah, I use Wagner.

456
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:58,101
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

457
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,811
Hey, they're gonna play music!

458
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,361
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

459
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:14,121
So we don't get our
balls blown off.

460
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:30,221
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust, put
on psy war op, make it loud.

461
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:34,101
This is a Romeo Foxtrot.
Shall we dance?

462
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,191
-Jimmy!
-Yes, sir!

463
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,011
Run, Charlie!

464
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,831
We got some... There's
more and more down there.

465
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:45,581
Look out, automatic .50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

466
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:49,831
I've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

467
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:52,091
All right, this is Fox Five.
We're going in.

468
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:06,221
-All right. What a shot.
-Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

469
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:07,771
Get you a case of beer for that.

470
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,921
6-4-1-0, we're over the
village right now.

471
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,881
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

472
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:37,131
-I'm gonna check it out.
-Well done, hawks. Well done.

473
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:40,471
I want some 20 Mike-Mike Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

474
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,391
Ripple the shit out of them.

475
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:44,891
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
.50 caliber on board.

476
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:47,641
He's moving across to
resupply the weapon.

477
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:51,521
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

478
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,061
Don't these people ever give up?

479
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,571
Nice shot, Bill.

480
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,031
-Shit!
-All right, all right!

481
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:07,411
-It's just a flare!
-It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

482
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,451
Un-ass that shit.
Get it out of here!

483
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:13,331
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right. It's just a flare.

484
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,312
Everybody all right? Lance,

485
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:16,695
-you all right?
-I'm fine!

486
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:32,981
Get down!

487
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:57,751
I'm not going! I'm not going!
I'm not going!

488
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,416
We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.

489
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:17,311
Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold out over position...

490
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:20,231
Duke Six, Duke Six, we've
got wounded down there.

491
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:28,241
My God! Oh, my God!

492
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:32,251
-Get a stretcher over here!
-You're all right.

493
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,541
Please! Help me!

494
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,961
-Please, God! Help me!
-Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

495
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,131
-Let's give him some morphine.
-My God! My God!

496
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:47,511
-0-3-7-7-4-2.
-Where's that duster?

497
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,351
I want my wounded out of there and
in the hospital in 15 minutes.

498
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:51,971
I want my men out.

499
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,061
Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.

500
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:58,111
This is 10-10. We're gonna be in,
throw them on and get out...

501
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,671
She's got a grenade!
She's got a grenade!

502
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,551
Jesus! The whole
goddamn thing just...

503
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:29,681
-She blew the shit out of...
-Fucking savages.

504
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:32,973
Can I get a medevac?

505
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:34,345
What's going on down there...?
Holly Christ, she's a sapper.

506
00:44:34,811 --> 00:44:36,931
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny.

507
00:44:36,981 --> 00:44:38,981
Go in there. Put that right
skid right up her ass.

508
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:45,126
We gotta get some air in these trees. It's
goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

509
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:47,451
I'm taking fire. I'm
taking hits all over...

510
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:50,871
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

511
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:54,621
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. I got control.

512
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:06,261
-What do you think?
-Wow, this is really exciting, man.

513
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:09,761
-No, no! The waves! The waves!
-Right.

514
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,601
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

515
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:16,061
Look! Good six-foot swells!

516
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,541
Come here, Lance.

517
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:45,961
Incoming!

518
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:53,601
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir. Maybe
you ought to surf somewhere else.

519
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:57,681
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

520
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:01,731
Come here! Come here!

521
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:06,981
-Change!
-You mean right now, sir?

522
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:09,861
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

523
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:11,592
It's still pretty
hairy out there, sir.

524
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:13,991
-Do you wanna surf, soldier?
-Yes, sir.

525
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:16,491
That's good, son, 'cause
you either surf or fight.

526
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,581
That clear? Now get going.

527
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:22,251
I'll cover for them. And
bring a board for Lance!

528
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:25,631
We can't do shit until
the boat gets here.

529
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:29,551
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

530
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,681
-What?
-See how they break both ways?

531
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:35,641
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

532
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:37,851
We ought to wait for
the tide to come up.

533
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:40,731
-Lance, come here. Look. Look!
-Incoming!

534
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,021
The tide doesn't come
in for six hours!

535
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:50,361
You wanna wait here
for six hours?

536
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,821
Yo! Hey! Chief!

537
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,921
Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on!

538
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:09,881
-Let's go, dickheads, take off!
-God damn it!

539
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:12,671
Don't you think it's a
little risky for R&R?

540
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:17,391
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!

541
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:21,811
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.

542
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:26,311
Give me that RT, soldier.

543
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,031
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

544
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:33,151
God damn it! I want
that tree line bombed!

545
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:35,991
Big Duke Six, roger. Dove
One-Three, stand by.

546
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:37,991
Blow them into the
Stone Age, son!

547
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,741
No, back, no!

548
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:44,831
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right? Get that out of here!

549
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:48,251
-I'm sorry.
-Come here now. All right.

550
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:50,751
-No, ma'am. Sorry!
-Jimmy!

551
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:52,551
Hawk One-Two, Dove
One-Three, roger.

552
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:54,591
They need some napalm down
there in the tree line.

553
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,431
Can you guys push ground
and put it down there?

554
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,431
Right, One-Three. We're
fixing to fuck with them.

555
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,101
-What's the target?
-We're trying to suppress some mortar fire

556
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,641
off the tree line down there.

557
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:05,441
-Roger. Here we come.
-Good, give it all you got.

558
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,941
Bring in all your ships.

559
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,571
Medevac him in my chopper. Get
him back to the hospital.

560
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:15,651
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!

561
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:18,701
Get it out of here! And tell
my guys I want my board!

562
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:20,331
Big Duke Six, this
is Dove One-Three.

563
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:23,161
The jets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to on-station.

564
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:26,001
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.

565
00:48:29,461 --> 00:48:30,881
Don't worry.

566
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:33,491
We'll have this place cleaned
up and ready in a jiffy, son.

567
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,051
Don't you worry.

568
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:36,881
Give me those shorts.

569
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:42,561
These are from the air cav, a
present from me and the boys.

570
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,181
I want to see you do your stuff
in them out there. Okay?

571
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:11,131
You smell that?

572
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,751
-Do you smell that?
-What?

573
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,301
Napalm, son.

574
00:49:16,761 --> 00:49:19,131
Nothing else in the
world smells like that.

575
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:21,551
Come on. Move it! Move it!
Move it!

576
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:26,061
I love the smell of
napalm in the morning.

577
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:29,231
You know, one time we had a
hill bombed for 12 hours.

578
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:31,691
And when it was all
over, I walked up.

579
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:35,901
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

580
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:41,201
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

581
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:42,951
The whole hill,

582
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:45,791
it smelled like

583
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:49,751
victory.

584
00:49:55,131 --> 00:49:57,261
Someday this war's gonna end.

585
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:13,731
Lance, the wind!

586
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:15,821
-The wind!
-What?

587
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:19,401
It's blowing on shore! It's coming on
shore. It's gonna blow this place out!

588
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,951
-It's gonna ruin it!
-Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

589
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:25,371
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doing it!

590
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:28,871
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel,
but I'm afraid that does it.

591
00:50:28,951 --> 00:50:32,621
The kid's got a reputation. You can't
expect him to surf those sloppy waves.

592
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:35,211
-I understand what you're saying.
-Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.

593
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:38,301
-I couldn't surf that stuff.
-Lance, look.

594
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:40,421
I apologize. It's not my fault.

595
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,181
The waves are getting
blown out by the napalm.

596
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:43,261
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong...

597
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,301
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

598
00:50:45,431 --> 00:50:46,801
I accept your apology.

599
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:49,431
All right, then. But if you could
hang around just 20 minutes...

600
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,441
-Maybe some other time, Bill.
-Just 20 minutes.

601
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:55,021
-I'm an artist!
-Keep walking.

602
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:59,781
Okay, give it a try, guys! One
goes left and one goes right.

603
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,531
Look, Lance.

604
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:03,451
-You through surfing?
-Yeah!

605
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,411
-Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
-No.

606
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:06,781
-You sure?
-Yeah!

607
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:10,081
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
-It's the fucking napalm!

608
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:12,371
Just wait 20 minutes!

609
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:14,581
Damn! Fuck!

610
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,421
They're looking for you!

611
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:22,921
-Don't leave without me!
-Where the fuck you going?

612
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:27,761
Incoming!

613
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,271
-The colonel's surfboard!
-Get the fuck off me! It's mine!

614
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:38,571
-Guys, help!
-Get the board and let's get out of here!

615
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,281
Fucking Airborne!

616
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:18,521
-Lance.
-Chef, light up, man.

617
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:19,981
Come on. Let's get high.

618
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,031
-Want to smoke?
-Let's do it, man. Light up.

619
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:24,361
Someday this war's gonna end.

620
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:28,201
That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.

621
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:30,822
They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home.

622
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:32,121
Captain?

623
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:38,251
Trouble is, I'd been back there and I
knew that it just didn't exist anymore.

624
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,381
Buddha time, here.

625
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:48,641
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

626
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,981
If that's how Kilgore
fought the war,

627
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:59,651
I began to wonder what they
really had against Kurtz.

628
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:02,821
It wasn't just
insanity and murder.

629
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:06,611
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.

630
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:18,831
I mean, he never was
hurting for pussy.

631
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:20,381
I'm not here.

632
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:24,631
I'm walking through the
jungle gathering mangos.

633
00:53:25,551 --> 00:53:27,341
I meet Raquel Welch.

634
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:32,351
I make a nice mango
cream pudding,

635
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,431
kind of spread it around on us.

636
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:44,731
She's into mangos, too. She's,
like, one limb above me.

637
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:47,361
We're both in the
jungle here, nude.

638
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:49,281
-Hey, Chief.
-Yeah?

639
00:53:49,361 --> 00:53:51,321
Here comes that
Colonel guy again.

640
00:53:53,871 --> 00:53:56,161
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like?

641
00:53:57,331 --> 00:54:02,631
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.

642
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:07,961
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.

643
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:11,341
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

644
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,171
He's a determined motherfucker!

645
00:54:13,221 --> 00:54:14,761
I will not hurt or harm you.

646
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,311
-Cocksucker!
-I will not hurt or harm you.

647
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:21,231
Just give me back
the board, Lance.

648
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,691
It was a good board,
and I like it.

649
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:27,361
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

650
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:32,071
-I will not hurt or harm you.
-Jesus Christ.

651
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:34,161
That guy's too
fucking much, man.

652
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:36,661
Do you think he
would have shot us?

653
00:54:37,116 --> 00:54:38,636
He wouldn't have shot
us on the beach,

654
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:41,181
but I think he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

655
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:44,405
<i>Let's go surfin' now,
everybody's learning how...</i>

656
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:46,111
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

657
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:48,301
Sucker.

658
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,511
How am I going to shoot him the
next time he comes around?

659
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,631
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

660
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:58,431
Sock it to me, Lance.

661
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:05,941
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

662
00:55:06,021 --> 00:55:08,781
Hell, he's probably got them all
over the river with that recording.

663
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:11,331
We'll have to hole up
here till dark, Chief.

664
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,611
Don't worry, Lance. He
won't follow us too far.

665
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,451
What makes you say that?

666
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:17,636
You think that big cav colonel
wants everyone upriver

667
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:19,161
to know we stole his board?

668
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,621
I didn't steal it!

669
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:27,291
Captain? Just how far
up this river we going?

670
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,511
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell you.

671
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,011
We're going up pretty far.

672
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,141
Is it gonna be hairy?

673
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,811
I don't know, kid.

674
00:55:42,981 --> 00:55:44,481
Yeah, probably.

675
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:47,981
You like it like that,
Captain, when it's hot, hairy?

676
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:49,981
Fuck.

677
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:03,371
Never get a chance to know what the
fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.

678
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:10,001
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get
those mangoes now, okay?

679
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:12,421
-Take somebody with you.
-Yeah, I'll take...

680
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:14,171
I'll go with him.

681
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:21,351
Chef?

682
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,851
-Yes, sir?
-How come they call you that?

683
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:27,021
-Call me what, sir?
-Chef.

684
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:30,691
-Because you like mangos and stuff?
-No, sir, I'm a real chef.

685
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:35,151
-I'm a saucier.
-Saucier?

686
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:41,741
Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier,

687
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:43,701
a great saucier.

688
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:47,711
-What's a saucier?
-You specialize in sauces.

689
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,301
Gotta be a mango
tree here somewhere.

690
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:05,311
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

691
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:09,651
But then I got orders
for my physical.

692
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:26,001
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

693
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,371
A cook school, that did it.

694
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:33,421
-Yeah, how's that?
-You don't want to hear about that.

695
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:39,801
They lined us up in front
of 100 yards of prime rib.

696
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:43,181
All of us lined up,
looking at it.

697
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:45,931
Magnificent meat, really.

698
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:48,431
Beautifully marbled.

699
00:57:49,255 --> 00:57:50,955
Magnifique.

700
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:56,781
Next thing, they're throwing the meat into
these big cauldrons. All of it, boiling it.

701
00:57:58,071 --> 00:58:00,451
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.

702
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:03,991
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

703
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:08,081
That's when I applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the engine m...

704
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,661
What is it?

705
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,001
Charlie?

706
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:07,601
It's a tiger!

707
00:59:11,021 --> 00:59:12,981
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

708
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:16,691
Battle stations. Lance, up front!
On the .60, Clean!

709
00:59:16,771 --> 00:59:18,021
-Got it, man.
-Holy shit.

710
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:21,941
-Chef, come on!
-Fucking tiger!

711
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:24,161
-Captain, come on!
-What's happening?

712
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:26,701
-Let's go!
-Tiger!

713
00:59:27,451 --> 00:59:29,951
Chief, you were right. Never
get out of the fucking boat.

714
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,791
-Bring that .60 forward!
-Never get out of the boat!

715
00:59:33,251 --> 00:59:38,211
Never get out of the boat! I gotta
remember. Never get out of the boat.

716
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:43,801
-What happened? How many is it?
-A fucking tiger!

717
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:45,681
-What?
-A fucking tiger!

718
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:48,221
-Tiger?
-Yes! I've had it!

719
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:51,931
I've had the whole goddamn
fucking shit, man!

720
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:56,521
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because I'm fucking bugging out.

721
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:58,401
I didn't come here for this.

722
00:59:58,651 --> 01:00:01,151
I don't fucking need it!
I don't want it.

723
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:05,071
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

724
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:10,951
All I wanted to do was fucking cook! I
just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!

725
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:14,751
-It's all right. It's all right.
-What happened, bro?

726
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,791
You're all right. You're
gonna be all right.

727
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,251
-All right. It's gonna be all right.
-You're all right.

728
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:24,761
It's gonna be all right. Never
get out of the fucking boat.

729
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:26,591
Never get out of
the fucking boat.

730
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:29,931
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

731
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:33,891
Never get out of the boat.

732
01:00:34,351 --> 01:00:36,441
Absolutely goddamn right.

733
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:40,611
Unless you were
going all the way.

734
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,741
Kurtz got off the boat.

735
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,661
He split from the whole
fucking program.

736
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:59,751
How did that happen? What did
he see here on that first tour?

737
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:08,881
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

738
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:14,681
If you joined the Green Berets, there was
no way you'd ever get above colonel.

739
01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:17,981
Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.

740
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:23,941
And the more I read and began to
understand, the more I admired him.

741
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:27,951
His family and friends
couldn't understand it,

742
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:30,111
and they couldn't
talk him out of it.

743
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:35,541
He had to apply three times and
he put up with a ton of shit.

744
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:38,661
But when he threatened to
resign, they gave it to him.

745
01:01:42,881 --> 01:01:46,131
The next youngest guy in his
class was half his age.

746
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:49,761
They must have thought he
was some far-out old man,

747
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:51,341
humping it over that course.

748
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:56,021
I did it when I was 19 and
it damn near wasted me.

749
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:03,521
A tough motherfucker.
He finished it.

750
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:11,991
He could have gone for General,
but he went for himself instead.

751
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:16,991
"Dear Eva,"

752
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:22,881
"today was really a new one. Almost
got eaten alive by a fucking tiger."

753
01:02:25,301 --> 01:02:27,301
"Really un-fucking-believable,
you know?"

754
01:02:27,671 --> 01:02:30,421
"We're taking this guy, Captain
Willard, up the river,"

755
01:02:30,551 --> 01:02:33,301
"but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him."

756
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,561
"Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood.

757
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,271
-"I'll be coming home..."
-October 1967,

758
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:44,811
on special assignment, Kon
Tum Province, II Corps.

759
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:48,361
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces,

760
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:50,861
rated a major success.

761
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:58,581
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.

762
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:02,501
What balls.

763
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:07,541
They were gonna nail his ass to
the floorboards for that one.

764
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:11,761
But after the press got a hold of it, they
promoted him to full colonel instead.

765
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:18,971
Man, the bullshit piled
up so fast in Vietnam,

766
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:20,931
you needed wings
to stay above it.

767
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:53,131
This sure enough is a bizarre
sight in the middle of this shit.

768
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:56,301
Expecting us this time?

769
01:03:58,641 --> 01:03:59,891
Damned if I know.

770
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,691
Hello. Hello...

771
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:09,111
Jesus.

772
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:18,571
-Everything goes back up into the truck.
-What?

773
01:04:18,911 --> 01:04:20,531
We gotta get all that stuff up.

774
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:29,461
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

775
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:31,421
-Let's go!
-I bet you we can score up here.

776
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,301
Yo man, check out the bikes, Lance.

777
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:38,091
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

778
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:40,551
-That's a good one.
-Yeah, sukiyaki.

779
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,561
Yeah, man. This is something.

780
01:04:46,851 --> 01:04:48,441
-Please!
-This must be the guy.

781
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:50,151
Right over there.

782
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:53,361
Sergeant. Sergeant?

783
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:02,121
Three drums of
diesel fuel, PBR 5.

784
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:05,041
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all.

785
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:07,322
-What do you want?
-Can I get some Panama Red with it?

786
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,171
Panama Red. Yeah, I'll
get you Panama Red.

787
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:12,961
-Sergeant?
-Destination?

788
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:14,671
-I don't have no destination.
-I can't do a goddamn thing

789
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,551
without a destination.
You got a destination?

790
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:17,721
-Sergeant.
-I need diesel fuel.

791
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:19,841
All right. You got a destination?
I need a destination.

792
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:21,971
I can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

793
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:24,971
Sarge, these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

794
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:27,561
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

795
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:30,651
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

796
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:32,061
Eight bucks for that...

797
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,981
All right. Damn.

798
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:39,741
-Just give him some fuel.
-You got it.

799
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,991
-Dog starts barking.
-Hey, listen, Captain.

800
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:46,621
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

801
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:50,711
Just take this over to the man at
the supply desk and you got it.

802
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:54,171
Hey, listen, would you guys like some
seats, some press box seats for the show?

803
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,131
You want those? The show, man.
The show out here.

804
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,971
-Bunnies.
-Playboy bunnies?

805
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:01,841
You got it. You gonna be here?

806
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:06,971
Listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?

807
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:48,561
How you doing out there? I said,
"How you doing out there?"

808
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:53,271
Want to say hello to you from all of
us up here to all of you out there

809
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:56,691
who worked so goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!

810
01:06:57,321 --> 01:06:59,481
Hello, all you
paratroopers out there!

811
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:03,111
And the Marines!
And the sailors!

812
01:07:04,256 --> 01:07:06,136
We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!

813
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:08,041
'Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.

814
01:07:08,451 --> 01:07:09,491
Yeah!

815
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:13,191
And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like.

816
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:16,711
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.

817
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:23,181
Miss May, Miss Terry Teray!
Yeah!

818
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:28,681
And the Playmate of the Year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

819
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,231
What's the matter?

820
01:08:22,321 --> 01:08:25,281
They've got them here tonight.

821
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,741
Grease my gun!

822
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:43,051
I'm ready to... baby!

823
01:09:00,061 --> 01:09:02,151
You're cute. I like you.

824
01:09:02,731 --> 01:09:05,321
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

825
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:08,531
Oh, my God...

826
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:11,331
Yeah!

827
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:14,041
You fucking bitch!

828
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,331
Take it off!

829
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:20,831
Hey, lover! You want
us to come over?

830
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:24,301
-I sure do!
-Sign my centerfold!

831
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:28,591
Sign my centerfold!

832
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:32,051
Come on, baby! Come up here now.

833
01:09:32,141 --> 01:09:34,311
Get your goddamn hands
off of my girl!

834
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:46,821
Start her up.

835
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:53,411
Come on!

836
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,331
Will you sign these?

837
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,081
Girls! Let's go!

838
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,941
So long!

839
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:04,521
Charlie didn't get much USO.

840
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:09,651
He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.

841
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:18,081
His idea of great R&R was cold
rice and a little rat meat.

842
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:26,501
He had only two ways
home, death or victory.

843
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:41,061
No wonder Kurtz put a
weed up Command's ass.

844
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:45,441
The war was being run by a
bunch of four-star clowns

845
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:47,771
who were gonna end up giving
the whole circus away.

846
01:11:50,781 --> 01:11:53,361
Man, that was far fucking out.

847
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:56,281
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

848
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:59,371
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

849
01:12:00,161 --> 01:12:02,951
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

850
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:05,371
You can really get hung
up on these broads, man,

851
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:07,081
just like that cat in the delta.

852
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:08,811
-Yeah, you better believe it.
-What cat?

853
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:12,301
The one that went up for murder.
He was an Army sergeant.

854
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:16,091
Remember? This cat, man, he
really dug his Playboy, man.

855
01:12:16,181 --> 01:12:21,851
I mean, this cat, when the thing
arrived, he was there to meet it, man.

856
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:24,641
Look at these beautiful
fucking jugs, man!

857
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:28,151
Yeah. So anyway, he was working
ARVN patrols, you know,

858
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:31,571
had one of them cocky gook
asshole lieutenants and shit.

859
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:35,006
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

860
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:36,861
He said, "Give me
my magazine back."

861
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:41,031
Gook said, "You shut up. I
have you court-martial."

862
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:43,831
-Typical fucking ARVN.
-Yeah.

863
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:47,921
-So then the gook starts to go too far.
-Chef, take the wheel.

864
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:51,461
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's titties.

865
01:12:52,091 --> 01:12:53,131
Take the wheel.

866
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:56,017
He started sticking
pinholes and mutilating the

867
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,035
centerfold and all kinds
of shit like that.

868
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:00,971
And the sergeant said, "You
better not do that to her.

869
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:03,561
"You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

870
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,061
"Don't do her like that," right?

871
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:09,351
-Gook say, "Fuck you," in Vietnamese.
-Damn.

872
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:13,441
The sergeant, man, he just
couldn't handle it no more.

873
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:18,701
He just picked up his iron, flipped
it to rock 'n' roll and...

874
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:23,331
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag

875
01:13:23,411 --> 01:13:26,041
and blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

876
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:30,251
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
That was it for his ass.

877
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:35,631
-They burn him for it?
-The sergeant? Yeah, man.

878
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,841
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

879
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:41,141
It's too bad he didn't get
no medals or nothing.

880
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:47,521
Fucking ARVN, man. They
should have killed the fuck.

881
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:51,561
Should have given the
fucker a Silver Star.

882
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:55,321
Bummer for the gook,
though, ain't it?

883
01:14:01,781 --> 01:14:05,451
Good morning, Vietnam. I'm Army
Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.

884
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:09,211
It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.

885
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,581
And we have an important
message for all Gls

886
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:14,001
who are living off base
from the Mayor of Saigon.

887
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:15,091
Yeah!

888
01:14:15,171 --> 01:14:17,921
He'd like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills.

889
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:20,261
The Mayor wants you to
keep Saigon beautiful.

890
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:23,076
And now, here's another
blast from the past

891
01:14:23,101 --> 01:14:25,851
going out to big Sam who's all alone
at the mental room out there,

892
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:28,061
with the First Battalion,
35th Infantry,

893
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:32,481
and dedicated by the fire team
at An Khe to their groovy CO...

894
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:35,151
-The Rolling Stones, Satisfaction.
-Ooh. All right!

895
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:37,102
[Song "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"
by "The Rolling Stones"]

896
01:14:37,103 --> 01:14:39,097
Work out, Clean!

01:14:39,673 --> 01:14:41,607

"Commitment and Counter-Insurgency,
by Colonel Walter E. Kurtz."

"As long as our officers and troops perform
tours of duty limited to one year,"

920
01:15:50,431 --> 01:15:53,521

-Shit.
-Holy shit.

927
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:16,881
Chicken time. You ain't shitting, bro.
They're motherfucking...

928
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:21,341
-Who is that?
-What's going on?

929
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:25,631
Is that you, Lazzaro?

01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:45,401
-Fire on the canopy!
-I got it! I got it! Get out of there!

01:16:53,121 --> 01:16:54,831
Put that fucker out, man!

934
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:03,881
What the fuck they
think they're doing?

935
01:17:28,321 --> 01:17:31,451
Late summer, autumn 1968.

936
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,831
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush.

937
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,751
The camp started falling apart.

938
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:46,801
November.

939
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:51,141
Kurtz orders assassination of three
Vietnamese men and one woman.

940
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:55,811
Two of the men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.

941
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:01,861
Enemy activity in his old
sector dropped off to nothing.

942
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,401
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.

943
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:14,411
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that, his...

944
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:19,251
The Army tried one last time to
bring him back into the fold.

945
01:18:19,331 --> 01:18:20,371
Methods...

946
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:23,251
And if he'd pulled over, it all
would have been forgotten.

947
01:18:23,341 --> 01:18:24,381
Unsound.

948
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:28,011
-But he kept going...
-Now he's crossed into Cambodia...

949
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:29,991
and he kept winning
it his way...

950
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:31,931
with this Montagnard
army of his...

951
01:18:32,051 --> 01:18:33,091
and they called me in.

952
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:38,471
Man like a god. And follow every
order, however ridiculous.

953
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:45,481
They lost him. He was gone.

954
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,821
Nothing but rumors and
random intelligence,

955
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:51,951
mostly from captured VC.

956
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:57,371
The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.

957
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:01,661
He and his men were playing hit and
run, all the way into Cambodia.

958
01:19:07,921 --> 01:19:10,631
I know where I'm going. I'm
going to the White House

959
01:19:10,721 --> 01:19:15,051
to have dinner with the President
of the United States, baby.

960
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,391
That's where I'm going.

961
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:19,391
Hey, Chef, put the
cover on that.

962
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:22,391
Clean.

963
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:30,441
-How long has that kid been on this boat?
-Seven months.

964
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:34,071
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.

965
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,081
Very possible, Captain, he
thinks the same of you.

966
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:40,661
Yeah? What do you think, Chief?

967
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:42,501
I don't think.

968
01:19:43,751 --> 01:19:46,831
My orders say I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't!

969
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:50,761
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

970
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:05,481
We're going upriver about 75
klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

971
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:13,111
-That's Cambodia, Captain.
-That's classified.

972
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:17,071
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

973
01:20:19,621 --> 01:20:22,791
You just get me close to my destination,
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

974
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:27,961
All right, Captain.

975
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:51,111
"Dear Son,."

976
01:20:52,031 --> 01:20:53,741
"I'm afraid that both
you and your mother"

977
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:56,611
"will have been worried at not hearing
from me during the past weeks."

978
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:00,161
"But my situation here has
become a difficult one."

979
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:04,451
"I have been officially accused
of murder by the Army."

980
01:21:11,921 --> 01:21:14,761
"The alleged victims were four
Vietnamese double agents."

981
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:18,341
"We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence."

982
01:21:21,101 --> 01:21:25,021
"When absolute proof was completed,
we acted, we acted like soldiers."

983
01:21:26,561 --> 01:21:28,351
"The charges are unjustified."

984
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:34,531
"They are, in fact, and in the circumstances
of this conflict, quite completely insane."

985
01:21:45,621 --> 01:21:48,871
"In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action."

986
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:55,051
"There are many moments for ruthless
action, what is often called ruthless,"

987
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,761
"what may, in many
circumstances, be only clarity."

988
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:01,891
"Seeing clearly what there
is to be done and doing it."

989
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:03,011
Medevac, come in.

990
01:22:03,101 --> 01:22:05,811
"...directly, quickly, awake..."

991
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:07,521
Alpha Tango Tango.
Echo Tango Alpha...

992
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:09,241
"...looking at it."
...request dust-off.

993
01:22:09,311 --> 01:22:11,151
Three, maybe four KIAs. Over.

994
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:14,111
"I will trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter."

995
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:18,281
"As for the charges against
me, I am unconcerned."

996
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:19,361
Medevac, come in.

997
01:22:20,111 --> 01:22:24,081
"I am beyond their timid, lying morality.
And so I am beyond caring."

998
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:25,741
Medevac, do you read? Over.

999
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:29,211
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."

1000
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:50,731
Jesus.

1001
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:53,061
No wonder I couldn't
get them on the radio.

1002
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:55,061
What a dump.

1003
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:01,281
-Hi, there!
-How you doing?

1004
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:05,281
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got
there. Never seen one up here before.

1005
01:23:05,371 --> 01:23:08,741
You know, we called in a request for
a medevac. You guys receive it?

1006
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:10,871
Medevac? No.

1007
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:14,501
Yeah, we passed a downed
Huey with some KIAs.

1008
01:23:14,631 --> 01:23:16,461
-On your way here?
-Yeah.

1009
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:19,591
-You going up this river?
-Way up.

1010
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:24,391
-Way upriver? Forget it.
-Why? Why?

1011
01:23:25,051 --> 01:23:27,311
Well, we want to send
some people downriver.

1012
01:23:27,391 --> 01:23:29,891
-Just forget it.
-What the fuck was that?

1013
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:33,441
-We'll be back in a couple of days.
-Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1014
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:42,401
-Chief?
-Yeah, Captain?

1015
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:43,911
Why don't you see what you
can do with that engine?

1016
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,711
-I'm gonna have a look around.
-All right.

1017
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,781
Hey, don't leave without me.

1018
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:14,481
-Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
-Don't ask me, man.

1019
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:37,881
Give me my clothes
back, asshole!

1020
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:42,461
Asshole!

1021
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:50,301
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1022
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:54,141
He stepped on a land mine
about two months ago.

1023
01:24:54,601 --> 01:24:57,561
-Got all blown to hell.
-Who's in charge here?

1024
01:24:57,651 --> 01:25:01,151
Charge? I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1025
01:25:01,321 --> 01:25:04,861
Just doing what I'm told. Shit,
I'm just a working girl.

1026
01:25:04,951 --> 01:25:06,821
What about you, fella?

1027
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:10,911
Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam.
You mark my words.

1028
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:13,581
-Keep it in that condition.
-Hey, get off my back. Get off my back.

1029
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:15,141
-No, man, I'm telling you.
-Lay off!

1030
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:20,751
Hey, hey, come here!

1031
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:23,631
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1032
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:26,841
What do you want?

1033
01:25:26,931 --> 01:25:29,591
Come on inside. I want to talk to you.
Come on!

1034
01:25:32,971 --> 01:25:34,391
Get out of the rain.

1035
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:35,851
Get off me!

1036
01:25:37,101 --> 01:25:39,561
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Come on.

1037
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:43,611
Hey, how you doing, Captain? I
want you to meet some people.

1038
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:50,201
-I got your ass.
-Your ass is shit, Chef. Your ass is shit.

1039
01:25:50,281 --> 01:25:52,121
You're a motherfucker, man.

1040
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:58,411
What a motherfucker, man!

1041
01:26:00,211 --> 01:26:02,631
God damn, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1042
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,881
Get him off me, Chef!
You smartass.

1043
01:26:10,051 --> 01:26:11,301
Hey, guys.

1044
01:26:12,391 --> 01:26:14,311
I got you! I got your ass!

1045
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:17,481
-You ain't shit, Chef.
-Hey, fellas.

1046
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,981
-You pulled my fucking...
-Guys.

1047
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:24,571
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1048
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:28,901
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1049
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:38,251
Captain!

1050
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:41,421
Hey, hey, you shitting me?

1051
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:44,791
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels
and get up to that big tent.

1052
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:46,341
Come on!

1053
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:49,511
Captain.

1054
01:26:51,011 --> 01:26:53,721
You're giving away our fuel
for a Playmate of the Month?

1055
01:26:53,891 --> 01:26:56,561
Nope. Playmate of
the Year, Chief.

1056
01:26:56,971 --> 01:26:58,971
Warm them up, baby!
Warm them up!

1057
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:01,441
Warm them up.

1058
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:04,231
Captain, we get in a firefight
and run out of fuel,

1059
01:27:04,691 --> 01:27:06,361
I want you to tell
me how she was.

1060
01:27:07,361 --> 01:27:10,531
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1061
01:27:15,031 --> 01:27:17,701
-You got some mamas in there?
-Some what?

1062
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:23,171
Forget it, Captain. I'll
stay with the boat.

1063
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:26,591
Hey, Captain, give me a hand.

1064
01:27:48,901 --> 01:27:54,281
I got every one of your pictures. I got
the centerfold, the Playmates Review,

1065
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:58,741
the Playmate of the Year runoff.
I even got the calendar.

1066
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:01,041
Hey, oiseau.

1067
01:28:02,621 --> 01:28:04,081
Wait, how come you got a bird?

1068
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:06,711
I used to be the bird
girl at Busch Gardens.

1069
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:10,001
-Busch Gardens?
-Yeah, I used to train birds there.

1070
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:16,841
-You are Miss December, aren't you?
-Miss May.

1071
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:18,551
Is it coming?

1072
01:28:25,651 --> 01:28:28,481
-Miss December has black hair.
-It's over there.

1073
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:31,481
He's not one of
my regular birds.

1074
01:28:33,281 --> 01:28:36,911
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1075
01:28:37,451 --> 01:28:43,701
Being Playmate of the Year is the
loneliest experience I can imagine.

1076
01:28:45,211 --> 01:28:50,631
It's like you try to express
your feelings to someone

1077
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:53,301
and show them your heart...

1078
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:57,131
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.

1079
01:29:02,351 --> 01:29:06,061
But would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1080
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:11,611
And there's this glass wall between
you, this invisible glass,

1081
01:29:12,231 --> 01:29:14,991
and they can see
your mouth moving.

1082
01:29:15,281 --> 01:29:17,571
I used to train birds for
at least two years...

1083
01:29:17,661 --> 01:29:18,911
That's beautiful, yeah.
...at Busch Gardens.

1084
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:21,241
This was cascading over
your right shoulder,

1085
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:23,041
and this, this was open here.

1086
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:25,871
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1087
01:29:26,871 --> 01:29:31,091
I used to train them to stand on their head
and fly upside down and ride little bicycles.

1088
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:32,732
Your right hand was
kind of over there.

1089
01:29:33,551 --> 01:29:36,471
-Hey, Chef!
-Hey, come on, get out of here, man!

1090
01:29:37,341 --> 01:29:39,931
-Later! Later!
-Does he want to talk to you?

1091
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:41,051
Give me 15 minutes.

1092
01:29:41,141 --> 01:29:45,021
You can never really make them
hear what you're trying to say.

1093
01:29:45,231 --> 01:29:47,021
You okay with kind of bending?

1094
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:49,421
That's it. Yeah, your ass was
sticking out just a little...

1095
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:50,771
Hey, man, fuck off!

1096
01:29:50,981 --> 01:29:52,021
Fifteen minutes!

1097
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:55,821
That's why I tried
so desperately

1098
01:29:56,701 --> 01:30:00,531
to show somebody that
I had some talent.

1099
01:30:00,701 --> 01:30:03,951
Little baby macaws. Have you
ever seen a baby macaw?

1100
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,886
-That's kind of...
-They're all blue.

1101
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,961
-Come on, man! Take off, would you?
-Open up!

1102
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:10,461
I got my rights, man!

1103
01:30:11,171 --> 01:30:13,791
They make you do things
that you don't want to do.

1104
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:18,051
Like... Like this picture here.

1105
01:30:20,591 --> 01:30:23,601
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1106
01:30:24,636 --> 01:30:26,156
You were just kind
of bending forward.

1107
01:30:26,181 --> 01:30:28,301
Really, really cute. Your
ass, kind of out a bit.

1108
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:30,641
-I love training birds.
-That's it.

1109
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:34,191
That's it. That's it. Voilà!

1110
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:37,861
You're beautiful.
I just want to...

1111
01:30:40,071 --> 01:30:46,121
You know, I can't believe it. Me, Jay Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here, you know?

1112
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:50,831
Maybe I'm unfit to
have a relationship

1113
01:30:50,921 --> 01:30:55,251
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1114
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:59,301
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War,

1115
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:02,971
-I never would've met you, Miss December.
-Miss May.

1116
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:09,771
I wish... I wish I could
find just one person

1117
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:15,271
that could share
my point of view.

1118
01:31:22,571 --> 01:31:24,071
You kiss like a bird!

1119
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:26,871
God! Kiss me, kiss me.

1120
01:31:27,831 --> 01:31:28,911
Who is that?

1121
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:31,461
You're driving me crazy!
Kiss me!

1122
01:31:32,961 --> 01:31:34,961
-Oh, my God.
-I love birds!

1123
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:41,131
You finished yet?

1124
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:44,221
Holy fuck!

1125
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:51,141
Make like a bird! Make like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cockatoo me!

1126
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:54,191
-Fly!
-I can fly like an eagle!

1127
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:56,901
-Fly like an eagle!
-It drives me crazy!

1128
01:31:56,981 --> 01:31:58,731
It drives me crazy!

1129
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:11,501
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1130
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:19,631
Lance, there were things
that they made me do

1131
01:32:19,711 --> 01:32:21,211
that I didn't want to do.

1132
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:25,051
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs,"

1133
01:32:25,141 --> 01:32:27,431
and I didn't want to do it,

1134
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:31,391
but they said that was
what was expected of me,

1135
01:32:31,561 --> 01:32:33,851
that that's what
people wanted to see.

1136
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:59,131
-Who are you?
-I'm next, ma'am.

1137
01:33:01,051 --> 01:33:02,591
Hell, I didn't know
he was a cherry.

1138
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:05,511
-Didn't know you never got no pussy.
-Shove it, fuck-up!

1139
01:33:05,591 --> 01:33:08,721
Sure sorry about that. If I had known,
I'd have taken you to New Orleans...

1140
01:33:09,101 --> 01:33:11,431
Man, fuck you. ...lntroduce
you to cooze, Bubba!

1141
01:33:11,511 --> 01:33:14,431
-Lay off, Chef.
-Cherry boy. Cherry boy.

1142
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:17,191
You're a fucking dog!

1143
01:33:17,271 --> 01:33:20,361
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,
and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.

1144
01:33:20,611 --> 01:33:21,651
Lay off, Chef.

1145
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:24,441
You're the only fucking
prick I see around here.

1146
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:26,991
If I want to play with a
prick, I'll play with my own!

1147
01:33:27,361 --> 01:33:29,281
Lay off, Chef! -What are you
gonna do with it, cherry boy?

1148
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:31,371
-Fucking cherry boy!
-Chef, I said lay off!

1149
01:33:31,911 --> 01:33:34,451
Chef, knock it off!
Give him a break!

1150
01:33:34,701 --> 01:33:38,251
What do you think I said?
And give your jaws a rest!

1151
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:41,671
And this ain't the Army.
You are a sailor!

1152
01:33:42,711 --> 01:33:46,421
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking
shirt and stop smoking that dope!

1153
01:33:46,761 --> 01:33:47,761
You hear me?

1154
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:55,101
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1155
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:57,141
-Camouflage.
-How's that?

1156
01:33:57,811 --> 01:33:59,731
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1157
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:03,151
I want you to stay awake up there, man.
You got a job to do.

1158
01:34:20,491 --> 01:34:24,431
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1159
01:34:24,381 --> 01:34:27,091
Let's take a look. Lance.

1160
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:30,341
Bring them in. Clean, on the .60.
Chef, get a .16.

1161
01:34:31,431 --> 01:34:33,141
Clean, get on that .60!

1162
01:34:36,431 --> 01:34:37,471
What's up, Chief?

1163
01:34:39,811 --> 01:34:41,981
A junk boat, Captain. We're
gonna take a routine check.

1164
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:45,111
Well, let's forget routine
now and let them go.

1165
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:47,611
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1166
01:34:48,031 --> 01:34:49,151
I'm gonna take a look.

1167
01:34:50,821 --> 01:34:52,411
Chief, my mission's
got priority here.

1168
01:34:52,491 --> 01:34:55,371
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this
part of the river if it wasn't for me.

1169
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:58,752
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1170
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:03,001
-Stand by, Lance.
-Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

1171
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:05,341
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1172
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:21,672
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1173
01:35:28,901 --> 01:35:31,191
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it!

1174
01:35:33,871 --> 01:35:36,031
-You two, come on.
-Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1175
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:37,581
I got you, Chief.

1176
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:43,171
It's clear, Chief.

1177
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:52,381
Okay, that's them. That's them.

1178
01:35:52,471 --> 01:35:54,051
-They're okay.
-Board and search it.

1179
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:57,326
It's just a fucking boat. There
ain't nothing on it, Chief.

1180
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:58,641
Board it and search it.

1181
01:35:58,721 --> 01:36:01,061
Just some baskets and some
ducks, fucking bananas.

1182
01:36:01,406 --> 01:36:03,286
-Ain't nothing on it.
-Don't be ashamed, Chef.

1183
01:36:03,311 --> 01:36:04,351
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

1184
01:36:04,441 --> 01:36:06,561
There's a goat and some fish.

1185
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:08,841
-Chef!
-Bunch of fucking vegetables.

1186
01:36:08,861 --> 01:36:11,111
-Get on that boat!
-There's nothing on it, man!

1187
01:36:11,191 --> 01:36:12,741
-Get on it!
-All right!

1188
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:15,361
Move it, asshole! God damn it!

1189
01:36:15,701 --> 01:36:18,411
Just some pigs. Look, mangos.

1190
01:36:18,491 --> 01:36:20,491
-What's in the rice bag?
-Fucking rice.

1191
01:36:20,581 --> 01:36:23,211
-Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
-Some fucking fish.

1192
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:27,081
More coconuts. Rice.
Here's rice.

1193
01:36:28,591 --> 01:36:29,961
What's in that vegetable basket?

1194
01:36:30,591 --> 01:36:32,051
Get out of here! Come on!

1195
01:36:32,341 --> 01:36:35,301
-Get over there, God damn it.
-Chef, check that vegetable basket.

1196
01:36:35,431 --> 01:36:36,841
-All right!
-Shut up, slope.

1197
01:36:36,931 --> 01:36:38,851
-There ain't nothing in here.
-What's in the boxes?

1198
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:39,971
Not a fucking thing.

1199
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:41,391
-Look in that tin can.
-Nothing.

1200
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:43,851
-That rusty can.
-Just fucking rice, that's all!

1201
01:36:43,941 --> 01:36:45,141
-There ain't nothing on it!
-Check the yellow can.

1202
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:47,521
Check the yellow can. She was
sitting on it. What's in it?

1203
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:53,111
Chef!

1204
01:36:57,781 --> 01:36:58,991
Motherfuckers!

1205
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:10,041
-Hold it!
-Come on, let's kill them all.

1206
01:37:10,711 --> 01:37:13,301
-Fucking cocksucking mothers!
-Hold it! Hold it!

1207
01:37:13,421 --> 01:37:16,051
Let's kill all the assholes! Shoot
the shit out of all of them.

1208
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:19,301
-Chef, hold it!
-Why not? Jesus Christ.

1209
01:37:20,261 --> 01:37:22,391
Why the fuck not?

1210
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:25,431
-Clean?
-I'm good.

1211
01:37:33,991 --> 01:37:36,241
-You okay, Lance?
-Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1212
01:37:36,321 --> 01:37:38,361
-Chef!
-Look what she was hiding, huh?

1213
01:37:38,821 --> 01:37:41,411
-You all right?
-See what she was running for?

1214
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:49,621
It's a fucking puppy.

1215
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:53,091
Give me that dog!

1216
01:37:53,171 --> 01:37:55,011
-No, you're not gonna get it!
-Fucking give it to me!

1217
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:56,921
Give me the fucking
dog, asshole!

1218
01:37:57,341 --> 01:38:01,011
-Fuck you! Fucking mango, too!
-Chef.

1219
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:02,641
You want that?

1220
01:38:02,721 --> 01:38:05,002
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1221
01:38:05,851 --> 01:38:06,981
-Chef!
-Yes!

1222
01:38:07,061 --> 01:38:08,771
She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1223
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:10,521
All right. All right.

1224
01:38:11,061 --> 01:38:12,941
Come on, Clean, God damn it.
Give me a hand.

1225
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:15,141
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

1226
01:38:15,741 --> 01:38:19,361
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

1227
01:38:19,725 --> 01:38:21,966
All right, Chef, just wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Chef.

1228
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:23,592
-Bring her up.
-Is she breathing, Chef?

1229
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:26,911
-She's hurt. She's bleeding.
-Man.

1230
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:29,541
Bring her on board. We're
taking her to an ARVN.

1231
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:31,332
What are you talking about?

1232
01:38:31,426 --> 01:38:33,186
We're taking her to some
friendlies, Captain.

1233
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:34,711
She's wounded, she's not dead.

1234
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:37,291
-Get out of there, Chef.
-The book says, Captain...

1235
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:50,851
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1236
01:38:51,561 --> 01:38:53,271
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1237
01:39:54,461 --> 01:39:57,251
It was the way we had over
here of living with ourselves.

1238
01:39:58,631 --> 01:40:01,551
We'd cut them in half with a machine
gun and give them a Band-Aid.

1239
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:10,971
It was a lie, and the more I saw
of them, the more I hated lies.

1240
01:40:13,481 --> 01:40:17,481
Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again.

1241
01:40:18,191 --> 01:40:20,781
But I felt like I knew one
or two things about Kurtz

1242
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:23,071
that weren't in the dossier.

1243
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:32,201
Do Luong bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River.

1244
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:38,881
Beyond that, there
was only Kurtz.

1245
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:44,631
Lance! Hey, Lance,
what do you think?

1246
01:40:45,221 --> 01:40:46,261
It's beautiful.

1247
01:40:48,221 --> 01:40:51,061
I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

1248
01:40:52,101 --> 01:40:54,681
Hey, you know that last
tab of acid I was saving?

1249
01:40:55,101 --> 01:40:57,601
-Yeah.
-I dropped it.

1250
01:40:57,771 --> 01:40:59,811
You dropped acid? Far out.

1251
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:15,621
-Take me home.
-God damn you!

1252
01:41:25,171 --> 01:41:27,221
God damn!

1253
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:29,681
You'll get what you deserve!

1254
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:40,651
Is there a Captain
Willard on board?

1255
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:42,111
-Yeah!
-Captain Willard?

1256
01:41:42,191 --> 01:41:45,031
-Yeah, who's that?
-Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1257
01:41:45,111 --> 01:41:46,701
Get that light off me.

1258
01:41:48,321 --> 01:41:51,161
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1259
01:41:51,241 --> 01:41:54,411
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1260
01:41:54,871 --> 01:41:56,661
You don't know how happy
this makes me, sir.

1261
01:41:56,751 --> 01:41:58,421
-Why?
-Now I can get out of here,

1262
01:41:58,501 --> 01:42:00,081
if I can find a way.

1263
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:06,801
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

1264
01:42:11,551 --> 01:42:13,351
Captain, where you going?

1265
01:42:13,431 --> 01:42:16,101
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

1266
01:42:17,601 --> 01:42:21,521
Pick me up on the other side of the bridge.
-Somebody go with him. Chef!

1267
01:42:21,611 --> 01:42:24,441
I'll go. I wanna go.

1268
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:40,791
You get your ass in gear.

1269
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:19,911
Come on, man. Listen
to the music, man.

1270
01:43:20,371 --> 01:43:24,251
-Where can I find the CO?
-You came right to it, son of a bitch!

1271
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:27,671
Lance! Get down here!

1272
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:34,681
-You still got a Commanding Officer here?
-Beverly Hills.

1273
01:43:35,011 --> 01:43:36,101
What?

1274
01:43:36,261 --> 01:43:41,061
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

1275
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:43,731
Where the fuck else do
you think it would be?

1276
01:44:18,891 --> 01:44:21,811
-God damn it, you stepped in my face!
-We thought you were dead.

1277
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:23,731
Well, you thought
wrong, damn it.

1278
01:44:27,571 --> 01:44:29,651
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1279
01:44:29,731 --> 01:44:31,531
You think you're so bad, nigga?

1280
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:33,441
What are you shooting
at, soldier?

1281
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:36,071
Gooks. What the fuck you
think I'm shooting at?

1282
01:44:36,701 --> 01:44:38,911
I'm sorry, sir. There are
gooks out there by the wire,

1283
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:40,661
but I think I killed them all.

1284
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:42,751
You ain't shot shit, man.
Listen!

1285
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:47,581
Shit, he's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.

1286
01:44:56,221 --> 01:44:58,391
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

1287
01:44:58,471 --> 01:44:59,721
They're all dead, stupid.

1288
01:44:59,811 --> 01:45:02,271
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1289
01:45:02,771 --> 01:45:05,271
Who's the Commanding
Officer here?

1290
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:06,771
Ain't you?

1291
01:45:08,941 --> 01:45:12,781
You think you're so bad, huh? I got
something for your ass now, nigga!

1292
01:45:12,901 --> 01:45:14,651
I got something for you now!

1293
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:18,621
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1294
01:45:20,371 --> 01:45:22,871
-Go get the roach, man.
-Go get the roach, man.

1295
01:45:22,951 --> 01:45:26,411
-Go get the roach, nigga!
-I'm gonna go get the roach.

1296
01:45:30,751 --> 01:45:34,341
Roach. Roach. Roach.

1297
01:45:35,131 --> 01:45:37,761
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

1298
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:40,601
-Lance!
-Do you hear them?

1299
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:46,601
Go bust them!

1300
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:52,481
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1301
01:46:01,911 --> 01:46:04,161
You hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1302
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:08,291
-Yeah.
-I'll kill you, GI!

1303
01:46:08,371 --> 01:46:09,461
You need a flare?

1304
01:46:11,461 --> 01:46:12,711
No.

1305
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:15,921
He's close, man.

1306
01:46:16,631 --> 01:46:18,511
He's real close.

1307
01:46:40,361 --> 01:46:41,245
GI, fuck you!

1308
01:46:52,961 --> 01:46:54,421
Motherfucker.

1309
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:57,461
Hey, soldier,

1310
01:47:01,431 --> 01:47:03,391
Do you know who's
in command here?

1311
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:07,271
Yeah.

1312
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:23,911
Shit!

1313
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:31,711
Yo, Chief, man, two guys just
got blown off that bridge.

1314
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:34,331
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1315
01:47:38,591 --> 01:47:40,421
-What's that?
-Mail, man.

1316
01:47:40,511 --> 01:47:43,181
Later on the mail!
Watch them trees.

1317
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:48,061
There's no diesel fuel, but
I picked up some ammo.

1318
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:49,771
Let's move out.

1319
01:47:49,851 --> 01:47:54,401
-Did you find the CO, Captain?
-There's no fucking CO here.

1320
01:47:55,901 --> 01:47:59,571
-Let's just get going.
-Which way, Captain?

1321
01:48:05,661 --> 01:48:07,661
You know which way, Chief.

1322
01:48:08,451 --> 01:48:10,241
You're on your own, Captain.

1323
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:12,961
Do you wanna go on?

1324
01:48:13,461 --> 01:48:17,671
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1325
01:48:17,751 --> 01:48:20,421
just so the generals can
say the road's open.

1326
01:48:20,961 --> 01:48:22,471
Think about it.

1327
01:48:25,551 --> 01:48:27,971
-Who cares?
-Just get us upriver!

1328
01:48:32,481 --> 01:48:34,851
Chef, on the bow.

1329
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:37,901
-Stand by, Clean.
-Let's go.

1330
01:49:34,661 --> 01:49:36,121
Whose package is that?

1331
01:49:36,371 --> 01:49:40,541
-Shit, you got another one, Clean.
-No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1332
01:49:40,881 --> 01:49:42,591
-That's it for you.
-Lance!

1333
01:49:43,421 --> 01:49:45,721
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1334
01:49:47,261 --> 01:49:50,221
Far out, man. All right. I've
been waiting for this one.

1335
01:49:50,301 --> 01:49:52,971
I got another one,
got a box from Eva.

1336
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:56,391
"Lance, I'm fine.
I'm fine, Lance."

1337
01:49:56,771 --> 01:50:00,561
"Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1338
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:03,731
-Man, I want to get back to Antoine's.
-"Of course I remember the time we went..."

1339
01:50:03,821 --> 01:50:06,401
How could I fucking forget, man?
Beautiful.

1340
01:50:07,491 --> 01:50:10,031
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?"

1341
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:11,371
"Let me know."

1342
01:50:11,451 --> 01:50:14,911
Jim, it's here. It
really is here.

1343
01:50:19,421 --> 01:50:21,751
"There has been a new development
regarding your mission"

1344
01:50:21,841 --> 01:50:24,211
"which we must now
communicate to you."

1345
01:50:24,301 --> 01:50:26,301
"Months ago, a man was
ordered on a mission"

1346
01:50:26,421 --> 01:50:27,971
"which was identical to yours."

1347
01:50:28,631 --> 01:50:32,261
"We have reason to believe that he is
now operating with Colonel Kurtz."

1348
01:50:34,101 --> 01:50:37,731
"Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake."

1349
01:50:37,941 --> 01:50:39,941
"They assumed he was dead."

1350
01:50:40,351 --> 01:50:43,441
"Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."

1351
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:49,781
Captain Richard Colby,

1352
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:53,371
he was with Kurtz.

1353
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:55,951
Disneyland.

1354
01:50:56,831 --> 01:50:59,461
Fuck, man, this is
better than Disneyland.

1355
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:02,751
"Charles Miller Manson
ordered the slaughter"

1356
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:06,131
"of all in the home anyway
as a symbol of protest."

1357
01:51:06,211 --> 01:51:07,411
That's really weird, ain't it?

1358
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:11,591
-Purple haze, look.
-Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1359
01:51:11,971 --> 01:51:15,431
-I got a tape from my mom.
-Chief, rainbow reality, man.

1360
01:51:15,681 --> 01:51:17,811
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.

1361
01:51:18,141 --> 01:51:20,981
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1362
01:51:21,811 --> 01:51:24,611
She pictures me at home having
a beer and watching TV.

1363
01:51:26,571 --> 01:51:27,901
Hey, Lance, man.

1364
01:51:28,571 --> 01:51:30,281
Hot potato! Hot potato!

1365
01:51:31,071 --> 01:51:32,861
I'm so glad you
decided to join...

1366
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:35,911
Eva's not sure if she can have a
relationship with me, you know?

1367
01:51:36,871 --> 01:51:42,501
Here I am, 13,000 fucking miles away,
trying to keep a relationship open, my ass.

1368
01:51:43,131 --> 01:51:46,211
That's much more than I can
say for some of your friends.

1369
01:51:46,631 --> 01:51:50,131
If this tape is any good, I
will have Dad and the family

1370
01:51:50,221 --> 01:51:53,181
-send you a tape of their own...
-Hey, Lance.

1371
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:13,071
There! Over there!

1372
01:52:15,661 --> 01:52:18,121
Motherfuckers!

1373
01:52:28,671 --> 01:52:30,131
There! Over there!

1374
01:52:33,761 --> 01:52:35,681
Lance! Chef!

1375
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:44,191
-Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
-Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1376
01:52:44,731 --> 01:52:46,481
-Lance!
-Where'd the dog go?

1377
01:52:46,561 --> 01:52:49,401
Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1378
01:52:49,861 --> 01:52:52,861
Where's the dog? We got to
go back to get the dog!

1379
01:52:52,941 --> 01:52:56,531
-Hey, Clean.
-It's always been nice to have...

1380
01:52:56,621 --> 01:52:58,781
Hey, Bubba!

1381
01:52:59,081 --> 01:53:03,251
Bubba, you can't
die, you fucker!

1382
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:05,921
-And so, I'm hoping...
-Bubba!

1383
01:53:06,001 --> 01:53:10,881
That pretty soon, not too
soon, but pretty soon,

1384
01:53:10,961 --> 01:53:14,671
I'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,

1385
01:53:15,261 --> 01:53:18,221
and then when your wife get them
back, she'll be mad with me.

1386
01:53:20,641 --> 01:53:25,941
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come
to celebrate your coming home.

1387
01:53:26,441 --> 01:53:28,601
Granny and Dad are trying
to get enough money

1388
01:53:28,691 --> 01:53:29,981
to get you a car.

1389
01:53:30,071 --> 01:53:33,611
But don't tell her, because
that's our secret.

1390
01:53:34,991 --> 01:53:39,781
Anyhow, do the right thing, stay
out of the way of the bullets,

1391
01:53:40,331 --> 01:53:44,291
and bring your heinie
home all in one piece

1392
01:53:44,371 --> 01:53:48,581
because we love you very much.
Love, Mama.

1393
01:53:56,971 --> 01:54:00,301
Oh, man. You're so young.

1394
01:54:07,981 --> 01:54:09,651
Clean.

1395
01:55:22,511 --> 01:55:23,721
Hold on.

1396
01:55:26,561 --> 01:55:28,351
Throw me the glasses.

1397
01:55:40,651 --> 01:55:43,611
Lance, take the .16 on the bow.

1398
01:55:46,031 --> 01:55:49,291
Chef, Chef, on the .60.

1399
01:56:11,981 --> 01:56:13,231
Fuck me.

1400
01:56:50,971 --> 01:56:52,141
Lance.

1401
01:57:22,011 --> 01:57:25,841
Cover the Captain. Lance,
cover the Captain.

1402
01:57:43,821 --> 01:57:45,531
They're French. They're French.

1403
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:50,161
Chef, pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1404
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:52,201
Stand fast! Captain...

1405
01:58:27,611 --> 01:58:29,741
All right, you men, put
down your weapons.

1406
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:20,161
New Orleans.

1407
01:59:24,881 --> 01:59:26,711
We lost one of our men.

1408
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:35,431
We French always pay respects
to the dead of our allies.

1409
01:59:37,141 --> 01:59:38,931
You are all welcome.

1410
01:59:41,691 --> 01:59:43,811
My name is Hubert de Marais.

1411
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:47,571
This is my family's plantation.

1412
01:59:48,491 --> 01:59:50,651
It has been such for 70 years.

1413
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:55,411
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1414
02:02:07,541 --> 02:02:13,001
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone
Miller on behalf of a grateful nation.

1415
02:02:33,361 --> 02:02:37,901
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?
The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it.

1416
02:02:37,991 --> 02:02:39,951
Can I speak with the chef?

1417
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:42,121
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

1418
02:02:42,451 --> 02:02:46,411
No kidding. He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1419
02:02:46,501 --> 02:02:49,161
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

1420
02:02:51,501 --> 02:02:53,001
Hey, Lance.

1421
02:03:21,781 --> 02:03:23,411
This is Baudelaire.

1422
02:03:23,491 --> 02:03:26,581
It's a very cruel poem for
children, but they need it,

1423
02:03:26,661 --> 02:03:29,331
because life sometimes
is very cruel.

1424
02:03:31,171 --> 02:03:32,791
As you can see...

1425
02:03:36,131 --> 02:03:39,971
-Attacks repelled by the family.
-Just for this war.

1426
02:03:40,471 --> 02:03:43,011
Viet Cong, 58.

1427
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:45,051
North Vietnamese, 12.

1428
02:03:45,761 --> 02:03:47,641
South Vietnamese, 11.

1429
02:03:48,561 --> 02:03:50,351
Americans, six.

1430
02:03:51,891 --> 02:03:54,731
Yes, well, they were
perhaps mistakes.

1431
02:04:15,921 --> 02:04:18,841
May I present Captain Willard?
He's of a paratroop regiment.

1432
02:04:19,421 --> 02:04:21,591
-Madame Sarrault.
-Captain.

1433
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:52,201
I'm sorry, Captain. Was just
a little story about Paris

1434
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:53,541
and people starving
during the war.

1435
02:04:53,621 --> 02:04:55,711
They are around the table
and there was a silence.

1436
02:04:55,791 --> 02:04:58,341
Somebody says, "An
angel is passing by."

1437
02:04:58,671 --> 02:05:01,341
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1438
02:05:09,471 --> 02:05:12,811
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1439
02:05:13,231 --> 02:05:14,771
We stay forever.

1440
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:17,271
No, no, I mean,

1441
02:05:18,941 --> 02:05:20,981
when will you go
back home to France?

1442
02:05:24,201 --> 02:05:25,951
I mean, this is our
home, Captain.

1443
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:28,161
-Sooner or later you're gonna...
-No!

1444
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:34,001
You don't understand our mentality,
the French Officer mentality.

1445
02:05:34,961 --> 02:05:37,251
At first, we lose in
Second World War.

1446
02:05:37,331 --> 02:05:40,131
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1447
02:05:42,631 --> 02:05:45,511
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Nigeria, we lose.

1448
02:05:45,591 --> 02:05:47,381
In Indochina, we lose.

1449
02:05:48,051 --> 02:05:50,511
But here, we don't lose.

1450
02:05:51,181 --> 02:05:56,271
This piece of earth, we keep it!
We will never lose that, never!

1451
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:03,531
The Americans,

1452
02:06:06,401 --> 02:06:09,361
in 1945, yes,

1453
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:11,871
after the Japanese War,

1454
02:06:12,701 --> 02:06:15,121
your President Roosevelt
didn't want the French people

1455
02:06:15,201 --> 02:06:17,291
to stay in Indochina.

1456
02:06:19,211 --> 02:06:22,001
So, you Americans

1457
02:06:22,091 --> 02:06:24,051
invent the Viet Minh.

1458
02:06:26,051 --> 02:06:27,881
-What's he mean?
-Yeah, that's true.

1459
02:06:28,091 --> 02:06:30,551
The Viet Cong were invented
by the Americans, sir.

1460
02:06:31,891 --> 02:06:33,101
The Americans?

1461
02:06:33,721 --> 02:06:38,061
Now you take the French place,
and the Viet Minh fight you,

1462
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:40,521
and what can you do?

1463
02:06:40,611 --> 02:06:43,061
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1464
02:06:43,231 --> 02:06:46,321
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1465
02:06:46,741 --> 02:06:48,741
The Russians want to help them.

1466
02:06:49,111 --> 02:06:51,741
"Come and give us some money.
We are all communists."

1467
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:54,371
"Chinese, give us guns.
We are all brothers."

1468
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:55,911
They hate the Chinese.

1469
02:06:56,791 --> 02:07:00,961
Maybe they hate Americans less
than the Russians and the Chinese.

1470
02:07:01,146 --> 02:07:03,106
I mean, if tomorrow the
Vietnamese are communists,

1471
02:07:03,131 --> 02:07:05,381
they will be
Vietnamese communists.

1472
02:07:06,011 --> 02:07:08,721
And this is something that you
never understood, you Americans.

1473
02:07:09,431 --> 02:07:11,721
I don't know. Maybe
in the future

1474
02:07:11,801 --> 02:07:14,261
we can make something
with the Viet Minh.

1475
02:07:14,511 --> 02:07:16,101
Don't you understand?

1476
02:07:16,431 --> 02:07:19,141
The VC say, "Go away! Go away!"

1477
02:07:19,271 --> 02:07:21,981
That's finished for all the
white people in Indochina.

1478
02:07:22,061 --> 02:07:25,231
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1479
02:07:25,441 --> 02:07:29,111
Go! They want to forget you.
Look at them.

1480
02:07:31,241 --> 02:07:33,991
Look, this is the truth. An egg.

1481
02:07:37,161 --> 02:07:38,701
The white left.

1482
02:07:40,211 --> 02:07:42,081
The yellow stay.

1483
02:07:50,131 --> 02:07:51,301
When I was in Saigon,

1484
02:07:51,381 --> 02:07:55,141
I spoke to an American politician
and he explained it very well.

1485
02:07:55,221 --> 02:07:58,851
He said, "Look, yesterday
it was Korea",

1486
02:07:58,931 --> 02:08:04,811
"today, Vietnam, tomorrow, Thailand, the
Philippines, and then maybe Europe."

1487
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:08,611
Why not Europe?

1488
02:08:08,691 --> 02:08:11,071
Look what happened in
Czechoslovakia recently!

1489
02:08:11,241 --> 02:08:12,861
And even before the
Second World War,

1490
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:15,031
the Americans knew exactly
what was going on.

1491
02:08:15,121 --> 02:08:17,531
They don't want that
shit to take over!

1492
02:08:20,451 --> 02:08:24,961
-All you white people are shit.
-They are fighting. Fighting for freedom.

1493
02:08:25,041 --> 02:08:27,171
Freedom? Bullshit.

1494
02:08:27,551 --> 02:08:30,261
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1495
02:08:30,721 --> 02:08:32,421
Dien Bien Phu is a trap.

1496
02:08:33,261 --> 02:08:36,341
All soldiers know they
are already dead.

1497
02:08:38,391 --> 02:08:40,311
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1498
02:08:43,441 --> 02:08:47,401
-Yeah, I know.
-No, you don't, not really.

1499
02:08:47,481 --> 02:08:50,481
Dien Bien Phu was an error, you know?
A military mistake.

1500
02:08:50,611 --> 02:08:54,281
A mistake? A voluntary mistake!
Voluntary!

1501
02:08:56,991 --> 02:09:00,951
All the soldiers knew. We
knew we would be dead.

1502
02:09:01,701 --> 02:09:03,461
Generals and colonels
believe it's impossible

1503
02:09:03,541 --> 02:09:07,831
for the Viets to get a cannon up
there in the mountains, but they do.

1504
02:09:08,591 --> 02:09:11,381
Then they wait for
the rain to come.

1505
02:09:12,551 --> 02:09:16,591
When it comes, no
airplane can fly there.

1506
02:09:16,801 --> 02:09:22,431
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters. I
mean, you know, 90 meters, 70 meters...

1507
02:09:22,521 --> 02:09:25,691
I mean, that's crazy. No army
in the world can do that.

1508
02:09:26,271 --> 02:09:29,731
And they only do that to be
dead with their friends.

1509
02:09:31,731 --> 02:09:33,071
No, no!

1510
02:09:36,241 --> 02:09:38,411
The French army was sacrificed,

1511
02:09:38,621 --> 02:09:41,331
sacrificed by the
politicians safe at home.

1512
02:09:41,411 --> 02:09:44,132
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1513
02:09:45,331 --> 02:09:48,831
The students are marching in
Paris, protesting, demonstrating.

1514
02:09:48,921 --> 02:09:51,041
They stab the
soldiers in the back.

1515
02:09:51,171 --> 02:09:55,051
The soldier would open the
grenade, it wouldn't work.

1516
02:09:55,341 --> 02:09:57,131
A piece of paper would fall.

1517
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:02,761
Union of French Women.
"We are for the Viets."

1518
02:10:03,061 --> 02:10:04,311
Traitors.

1519
02:10:04,771 --> 02:10:06,891
Communist traitors at home.

1520
02:10:08,311 --> 02:10:09,851
Dien Bien Phu...

1521
02:10:10,231 --> 02:10:12,771
Okay, the French is shit.

1522
02:10:14,901 --> 02:10:17,201
No one cares. No one wants to.

1523
02:10:19,821 --> 02:10:23,791
Why don't you Americans learn from us?
From our mistakes?

1524
02:10:24,121 --> 02:10:26,161
Mon dieu, with your army,
your strength, your power,

1525
02:10:26,211 --> 02:10:27,411
you can win if you want to.

1526
02:10:30,461 --> 02:10:31,881
You can win.

1527
02:10:35,091 --> 02:10:38,301
You know, I'm sure we can
make something there.

1528
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:40,641
I'm sure about it, you know?

1529
02:10:41,181 --> 02:10:43,721
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1530
02:10:44,311 --> 02:10:47,731
I'm sorry, you know, but the communists
at home have never been traitors.

1531
02:11:21,681 --> 02:11:25,011
Excuse me. I have to go.
Captain, good night.

1532
02:11:25,351 --> 02:11:27,931
-I was a socialist, you know?
-I know we can stay.

1533
02:11:28,021 --> 02:11:32,021
I know that we can stay.
We can stay.

1534
02:11:34,941 --> 02:11:38,321
You know, we always
help the people.

1535
02:11:38,401 --> 02:11:40,111
We work with the people.

1536
02:11:56,671 --> 02:12:00,801
See, Captain, when
my grandfather

1537
02:12:02,261 --> 02:12:04,511
and my uncles and
father came here,

1538
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:09,681
there was nothing. Nothing.

1539
02:12:11,061 --> 02:12:13,231
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1540
02:12:15,151 --> 02:12:18,901
So, we worked hard, very hard.

1541
02:12:19,071 --> 02:12:23,861
We brought the rubber from
Brazil and then planted it here.

1542
02:12:24,781 --> 02:12:28,081
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them,

1543
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:29,831
make something.

1544
02:12:30,581 --> 02:12:32,581
Something out of nothing.

1545
02:12:34,171 --> 02:12:37,841
So when you ask me why we
want to stay here, Captain,

1546
02:12:39,421 --> 02:12:41,841
we want to stay here
because it's ours.

1547
02:12:41,921 --> 02:12:43,381
It belongs to us.

1548
02:12:44,091 --> 02:12:45,761
It keeps our family together.

1549
02:12:47,511 --> 02:12:49,511
I mean, we fight for that.

1550
02:12:51,431 --> 02:12:53,231
While you Americans,

1551
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:59,021
you are fighting for the
biggest nothing in history.

1552
02:13:06,991 --> 02:13:08,741
I'm sorry, Captain.

1553
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:13,961
I will see if your men need
any help to repair your boat

1554
02:13:14,251 --> 02:13:17,631
so that you can go
on with your war.

1555
02:13:52,791 --> 02:13:55,461
I apologize for my
family, Captain.

1556
02:13:57,501 --> 02:13:59,631
We have all lost much here.

1557
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:04,261
Hubert, his wife and two sons.

1558
02:14:08,681 --> 02:14:10,851
And I have lost a husband.

1559
02:14:16,771 --> 02:14:20,561
-I understand.
-You are tired of the war.

1560
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:24,781
I can see on your face.

1561
02:14:27,401 --> 02:14:31,531
It was the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1562
02:14:32,741 --> 02:14:33,791
We call them...

1563
02:14:36,911 --> 02:14:38,711
"The lost soldiers."

1564
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:46,131
If you like, we can
have some cognac.

1565
02:14:50,891 --> 02:14:52,141
No.

1566
02:14:52,931 --> 02:14:55,891
I'll see about my men and...

1567
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:06,281
The war will be still
here tomorrow.

1568
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:19,081
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1569
02:15:27,091 --> 02:15:29,761
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1570
02:15:31,011 --> 02:15:33,681
No, I don't drink wine.

1571
02:15:37,101 --> 02:15:41,601
I do like cognac, but I don't
want any now, thank you.

1572
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:47,981
Well, then I must drink alone.

1573
02:15:58,291 --> 02:16:01,661
Will you go back, after
the war, to America?

1574
02:16:05,631 --> 02:16:08,631
-No.
-Then you're like us.

1575
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:10,551
Your home is here.

1576
02:16:28,151 --> 02:16:32,071
Do you know why you can never
step into the same river twice?

1577
02:16:34,321 --> 02:16:37,491
Yeah, 'cause it's always moving.

1578
02:16:38,911 --> 02:16:42,041
I used to prepare a
pipe for my husband.

1579
02:16:49,341 --> 02:16:53,631
It was the morphine he took for the
wounds he suffered in his heart.

1580
02:16:57,301 --> 02:17:00,931
He would rage and he would
cry, my lost soldier.

1581
02:17:04,691 --> 02:17:06,351
And I said to him,

1582
02:17:07,111 --> 02:17:10,481
"There are two of
you, don't you see?"

1583
02:17:11,571 --> 02:17:15,201
"One that kills and
one that loves."

1584
02:17:17,321 --> 02:17:18,991
And he said to me,

1585
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:23,501
"I don't know whether I
am an animal or a god."

1586
02:17:26,961 --> 02:17:28,581
But you are both.

1587
02:18:10,461 --> 02:18:12,211
You want more?

1588
02:18:17,931 --> 02:18:21,761
All that matters is
that you are alive.

1589
02:18:23,431 --> 02:18:25,351
You are alive, Captain.

1590
02:18:29,651 --> 02:18:31,271
That's the truth.

1591
02:19:45,181 --> 02:19:48,681
There are two of
you, don't you see?

1592
02:19:50,021 --> 02:19:54,191
One that kills and
one that loves.

1593
02:20:23,551 --> 02:20:26,101
Can't see nothing.
We're stopping.

1594
02:20:26,601 --> 02:20:28,971
You're not authorized to
stop this boat, Chief.

1595
02:20:29,061 --> 02:20:31,891
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1596
02:20:32,641 --> 02:20:34,231
I ain't risking no more lives.

1597
02:20:34,311 --> 02:20:37,231
I'm in command here, God damn it.
You'll do what I say.

1598
02:20:39,401 --> 02:20:41,571
You see anything, Chef?

1599
02:20:43,571 --> 02:20:45,911
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1600
02:21:05,141 --> 02:21:07,261
Watch it over here, Chief.

1601
02:21:08,391 --> 02:21:10,061
Got a stump.

1602
02:21:11,481 --> 02:21:12,851
Lance, on the .50s.

1603
02:21:14,641 --> 02:21:16,441
He was close.

1604
02:21:18,481 --> 02:21:20,151
He was real close.

1605
02:21:22,441 --> 02:21:27,321
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him,
as if the boat were being sucked upriver

1606
02:21:27,411 --> 02:21:30,281
and the water was flowing
back into the jungle.

1607
02:21:32,831 --> 02:21:35,251
Whatever was going to happen,

1608
02:21:35,331 --> 02:21:39,291
it wasn't gonna be the way they
called it back in Nha Trang.

1609
02:21:43,971 --> 02:21:45,221
Arrows!

1610
02:21:45,301 --> 02:21:46,431
Fire!

1611
02:21:48,641 --> 02:21:49,891
Chef, open up! Fire!

1612
02:21:55,021 --> 02:21:56,981
Lance, fire!

1613
02:22:04,821 --> 02:22:08,111
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1614
02:22:08,621 --> 02:22:10,201
They're just little toy arrows.

1615
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:12,411
Cut it out! Quiet!

1616
02:22:12,661 --> 02:22:14,911
Chief, tell them to
hold their fire!

1617
02:22:15,331 --> 02:22:17,691
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1618
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:19,421
Quiet!

1619
02:22:20,461 --> 02:22:23,251
You got us in this mess, and
now you can't get us out

1620
02:22:23,341 --> 02:22:25,661
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do you?

1621
02:22:25,841 --> 02:22:27,011
Do you?

1622
02:22:28,011 --> 02:22:30,891
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1623
02:22:32,511 --> 02:22:34,851
-Lance, get the wheel!
-Fire!

1624
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:39,061
You savages! Come and get
it, you son of a bitches!

1625
02:22:59,541 --> 02:23:01,211
A spear.

1626
02:24:20,661 --> 02:24:23,501
My mission is to make
it up into Cambodia.

1627
02:24:24,131 --> 02:24:26,591
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane

1628
02:24:26,671 --> 02:24:28,551
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1629
02:24:29,971 --> 02:24:32,631
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1630
02:24:33,011 --> 02:24:34,971
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1631
02:24:35,301 --> 02:24:39,061
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1632
02:24:39,141 --> 02:24:42,981
That's fucking great! That's
just fucking great, man.

1633
02:24:43,731 --> 02:24:46,611
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1634
02:24:47,191 --> 02:24:50,151
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge

1635
02:24:50,281 --> 02:24:53,151
or some fucking rail road
tracks or something.

1636
02:24:54,161 --> 02:24:56,201
-Sorry.
-No, no, wait, wait.

1637
02:24:56,281 --> 02:24:59,581
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1638
02:24:59,661 --> 02:25:03,331
We'll go up there, but on the boat.
Okay?

1639
02:26:10,401 --> 02:26:14,361
Part of me was afraid of what I would find
and what I would do when I got there.

1640
02:26:17,411 --> 02:26:21,871
I knew the risks,
or imagined I knew.

1641
02:26:24,411 --> 02:26:28,581
But the thing I felt the most,
much stronger than fear,

1642
02:26:30,211 --> 02:26:32,131
was the desire to confront him.

1643
02:27:44,831 --> 02:27:46,121
Just keep moving.

1644
02:27:46,831 --> 02:27:50,501
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1645
02:29:17,421 --> 02:29:20,591
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1646
02:29:21,761 --> 02:29:25,011
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1647
02:29:26,431 --> 02:29:29,681
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1648
02:29:40,086 --> 02:29:42,086
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1649
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:44,571
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys bite you, I'll tell you.

1650
02:29:45,451 --> 02:29:47,951
That's a pretty one. Move
it right in toward me.

1651
02:29:49,371 --> 02:29:51,291
I'm an American. Yeah.

1652
02:29:51,581 --> 02:29:53,251
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1653
02:29:53,961 --> 02:29:55,461
Hi, American.

1654
02:29:55,961 --> 02:29:57,371
American civilian.
It's all right.

1655
02:29:58,131 --> 02:30:01,041
And you got the cigarettes. And
that's what I've been dreaming about.

1656
02:30:02,211 --> 02:30:03,301
Chef.

1657
02:30:04,051 --> 02:30:06,721
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

1658
02:30:11,011 --> 02:30:12,641
I'm a photojournalist.

1659
02:30:13,311 --> 02:30:15,311
I've covered the war since '64.

1660
02:30:15,691 --> 02:30:18,231
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and Nam.

1661
02:30:22,901 --> 02:30:25,651
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1662
02:30:26,651 --> 02:30:27,991
Who are all these people?

1663
02:30:28,071 --> 02:30:33,161
Yeah, they think you've
come to take him away,

1664
02:30:33,491 --> 02:30:36,371
-and I hope that isn't true.
-Take who away?

1665
02:30:38,671 --> 02:30:41,421
Him! Colonel Kurtz.

1666
02:30:42,461 --> 02:30:45,171
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1667
02:30:46,471 --> 02:30:48,971
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1668
02:30:49,891 --> 02:30:53,261
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1669
02:30:53,851 --> 02:30:59,521
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.
Well, you listen to him.

1670
02:31:01,021 --> 02:31:03,021
The man's enlarged my mind.

1671
02:31:03,901 --> 02:31:07,281
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1672
02:31:07,361 --> 02:31:10,571
Sometimes you'll say
hello to him, right,

1673
02:31:10,661 --> 02:31:13,101
and he'll just walk right by you
and he won't even notice you.

1674
02:31:13,121 --> 02:31:16,621
And then suddenly he'll grab you, he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1675
02:31:16,701 --> 02:31:19,822
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word
in 'life'? If you can keep your head"

1676
02:31:19,871 --> 02:31:21,671
"when all about you are losing
theirs and blaming it on you,"

1677
02:31:21,751 --> 02:31:23,831
"if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1678
02:31:24,501 --> 02:31:27,711
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1679
02:31:28,511 --> 02:31:31,321
"I should have been a
pair of ragged claws

1680
02:31:31,346 --> 02:31:34,285
scuttling across the floors
of silent seas.", I mean...

1681
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:34,991
Stay with the boat.

1682
02:31:35,411 --> 02:31:36,851
Hum.. Don't go any...

1683
02:31:36,876 --> 02:31:38,715
Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1684
02:31:42,231 --> 02:31:46,901
He can be terrible, he can be
mean, and he can be right.

1685
02:31:47,901 --> 02:31:50,741
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1686
02:31:54,306 --> 02:31:55,606
I mean...

1687
02:31:58,831 --> 02:32:02,041
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words.

1688
02:32:02,461 --> 02:32:05,102
I can tell you something, like, the
other day he wanted to kill me.

1689
02:32:05,631 --> 02:32:07,841
-Something like that.
-Why'd he want to kill you?

1690
02:32:08,341 --> 02:32:09,921
Because I took his picture.

1691
02:32:10,931 --> 02:32:13,221
He said, "If you take
my picture again",

1692
02:32:14,601 --> 02:32:18,221
"I'm gonna kill you,"
and he meant it.

1693
02:32:20,981 --> 02:32:24,941
So you just lay cool. Play
it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1694
02:32:25,571 --> 02:32:27,271
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1695
02:32:28,901 --> 02:32:31,281
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1696
02:32:32,201 --> 02:32:34,321
You don't judge the Colonel
like an ordinary man.

1697
02:32:41,291 --> 02:32:43,291
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans.

1698
02:32:43,421 --> 02:32:44,421
Americans!

1699
02:32:44,751 --> 02:32:46,251
You can feel the
vibe of this place.

1700
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:50,671
Let me take your picture. Could you hold...
Hello? Hello?

1701
02:32:50,801 --> 02:32:52,301
Could you hold up a minute?

1702
02:33:14,661 --> 02:33:15,821
Colby.

1703
02:33:32,301 --> 02:33:33,381
The heads.

1704
02:33:34,431 --> 02:33:39,641
You're looking at the heads. Sometimes
he goes too far. You know...

1705
02:33:40,521 --> 02:33:42,351
He's the first one to admit it.

1706
02:33:43,481 --> 02:33:45,731
-He's gone crazy.
-Wrong, wrong!

1707
02:33:47,691 --> 02:33:50,651
If you could have heard the
man just two days ago.

1708
02:33:50,731 --> 02:33:55,201
If you could have heard him then, God...
You're gonna call him crazy?

1709
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:57,241
Fucking A.

1710
02:33:58,701 --> 02:34:04,081
-I just wanna talk to him.
-Well, man, he's gone away.

1711
02:34:05,876 --> 02:34:08,436
He's gone away. He disappeared out
in the jungle with his people.

1712
02:34:08,461 --> 02:34:09,461
I'll wait for him.

1713
02:34:09,541 --> 02:34:13,711
He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.

1714
02:34:16,131 --> 02:34:18,431
-He forgets himself.
-Captain?

1715
02:34:19,051 --> 02:34:23,271
-Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
-Okay, Chef.

1716
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:28,311
-We'll go back to the boat for a while.
-Yeah, stay with Lance.

1717
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:56,101
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1718
02:34:57,761 --> 02:34:59,381
I mean that's what the
man's got set up here!

1719
02:34:59,471 --> 02:35:02,551
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1720
02:35:03,311 --> 02:35:04,641
Shit, he's loco.

1721
02:35:05,181 --> 02:35:08,191
-Then you'll help me?
-Help you? Fucking A, I'll help you.

1722
02:35:08,271 --> 02:35:09,691
I'll do anything to get
out of this joint.

1723
02:35:09,771 --> 02:35:10,811
Good boy.

1724
02:35:11,451 --> 02:35:12,931
We could blow all
them assholes away.

1725
02:35:13,191 --> 02:35:15,821
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1726
02:35:16,741 --> 02:35:21,241
I ain't afraid of all them fucking
skulls and altars and shit.

1727
02:35:23,371 --> 02:35:27,001
I used to think if I
died in an evil place,

1728
02:35:27,541 --> 02:35:29,621
then my soul wouldn't be
able to make it to heaven.

1729
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:33,541
But now, fuck.

1730
02:35:35,761 --> 02:35:38,051
I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1731
02:35:38,631 --> 02:35:41,471
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1732
02:35:41,551 --> 02:35:43,181
-No, no.
-Get out of here.

1733
02:35:43,431 --> 02:35:45,061
I'm gonna need you
to wait here, Chef.

1734
02:35:45,811 --> 02:35:49,351
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge
around, check the place out,

1735
02:35:49,981 --> 02:35:52,151
see if I can find
the Colonel, okay?

1736
02:35:54,191 --> 02:35:56,571
-What do you want me to do?
-Damn it.

1737
02:35:57,111 --> 02:36:03,111
Here, you take the radio, and if
I don't get back by 2200 hours,

1738
02:36:05,991 --> 02:36:07,331
you call in the air strike.

1739
02:36:10,121 --> 02:36:11,501
Air strike?

1740
02:36:13,251 --> 02:36:17,921
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1741
02:36:18,841 --> 02:36:20,171
It's all in there.

1742
02:36:21,841 --> 02:36:24,471
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1743
02:36:33,351 --> 02:36:36,691
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

1744
02:36:41,071 --> 02:36:46,741
The place was full of bodies. North
Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.

1745
02:36:54,421 --> 02:36:57,421
If I was still alive, it was
because he wanted me that way.

1746
02:37:31,871 --> 02:37:34,291
It smelled like slow
death in there.

1747
02:37:35,881 --> 02:37:39,131
Malaria, nightmares.

1748
02:37:41,921 --> 02:37:43,971
This was the end of
the river, all right.

1749
02:37:58,271 --> 02:37:59,691
Where are you from, Willard?

1750
02:38:05,281 --> 02:38:06,861
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1751
02:38:12,831 --> 02:38:15,461
-Were you born there?
-Yes, sir.

1752
02:38:17,631 --> 02:38:20,291
-Whereabouts?
-Toledo, sir.

1753
02:38:27,641 --> 02:38:29,431
How far are you from the river?

1754
02:38:36,391 --> 02:38:38,101
The Ohio River, sir?

1755
02:38:40,651 --> 02:38:42,321
About 200 miles.

1756
02:38:50,321 --> 02:38:53,281
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1757
02:38:58,171 --> 02:39:00,881
There's a place in the
river, I can't remember.

1758
02:39:01,251 --> 02:39:06,171
It must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1759
02:39:06,511 --> 02:39:09,261
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1760
02:39:09,341 --> 02:39:15,851
but for about five miles, you'd think
that heaven just fell on the Earth,

1761
02:39:17,271 --> 02:39:19,231
in the form of gardenias.

1762
02:39:35,541 --> 02:39:40,581
Have you ever considered
any real freedoms?

1763
02:39:46,381 --> 02:39:49,301
Freedoms from the
opinion of others?

1764
02:39:52,851 --> 02:39:54,801
Even the opinions of yourself?

1765
02:40:10,991 --> 02:40:14,571
Did they say why, Willard?

1766
02:40:16,831 --> 02:40:21,541
Why they wanted to
terminate my command?

1767
02:40:37,181 --> 02:40:39,391
I was sent on a
classified mission, sir.

1768
02:40:43,601 --> 02:40:47,111
No longer classified, is it?

1769
02:40:54,451 --> 02:40:55,871
What did they tell you?

1770
02:40:58,871 --> 02:41:05,171
They told me that you had
gone totally insane,

1771
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:14,471
and that your methods
were unsound.

1772
02:41:18,311 --> 02:41:20,221
Are my methods unsound?

1773
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:32,491
I don't see any
method at all, sir.

1774
02:41:39,581 --> 02:41:43,201
I expected someone like you.

1775
02:41:46,581 --> 02:41:47,831
What did you expect?

1776
02:41:56,091 --> 02:41:57,681
Are you an assassin?

1777
02:42:02,561 --> 02:42:03,731
I'm a soldier.

1778
02:42:07,611 --> 02:42:09,191
You're neither.

1779
02:42:11,361 --> 02:42:15,951
You're an errand boy
sent by grocery clerks

1780
02:42:20,701 --> 02:42:22,371
to collect a bill.

1781
02:43:06,331 --> 02:43:11,961
Why? Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1782
02:43:18,931 --> 02:43:20,681
Going down pretty good, huh?

1783
02:43:21,301 --> 02:43:22,391
Why?

1784
02:43:24,101 --> 02:43:25,771
You know?

1785
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:28,601
Do you know that the man,

1786
02:43:32,111 --> 02:43:34,111
the man really likes you?

1787
02:43:37,401 --> 02:43:43,281
He likes you. He really likes you, but
he's got something in mind for you.

1788
02:43:44,951 --> 02:43:46,541
Aren't you curious about that?

1789
02:43:47,121 --> 02:43:52,581
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1790
02:43:56,091 --> 02:43:58,881
There's something
happening out here, man.

1791
02:44:02,301 --> 02:44:04,801
You know something, man? I know
something that you don't know.

1792
02:44:05,311 --> 02:44:06,721
That's right, jack.

1793
02:44:07,021 --> 02:44:12,401
The man is clear in his
mind, but his soul is mad.

1794
02:44:14,361 --> 02:44:15,651
Oh, yeah.

1795
02:44:16,781 --> 02:44:20,781
He's dying, I think. He hates all this.
He hates it.

1796
02:44:21,861 --> 02:44:25,741
But the man's...

1797
02:44:29,251 --> 02:44:31,751
He reads poetry out
loud, all right?

1798
02:44:33,671 --> 02:44:37,341
And a voice, a voice...

1799
02:44:40,671 --> 02:44:45,011
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.

1800
02:44:45,431 --> 02:44:50,061
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1801
02:44:51,021 --> 02:44:52,481
You're gonna help him.

1802
02:44:52,851 --> 02:44:55,271
What are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone?

1803
02:44:55,401 --> 02:45:00,031
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1804
02:45:00,151 --> 02:45:01,191
What are they gonna
say about him?

1805
02:45:01,281 --> 02:45:05,741
What are they gonna say? "He was
a kind man. He was a wise man.

1806
02:45:05,991 --> 02:45:09,451
"He had plans. He had
wisdom." Bullshit, man!

1807
02:45:09,871 --> 02:45:13,921
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna set
them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1808
02:45:17,711 --> 02:45:18,801
You.

1809
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:26,051
Almost eight hours.

1810
02:45:28,601 --> 02:45:32,061
God. I'm asleep.

1811
02:45:33,981 --> 02:45:36,731
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1812
02:45:48,831 --> 02:45:49,911
Fuck.

1813
02:45:54,251 --> 02:45:55,831
Has it been eight hours?

1814
02:45:58,921 --> 02:46:03,591
Hello, Almighty, Almighty,
this is PBR Street Gang.

1815
02:46:04,091 --> 02:46:05,261
Radio check. Over.

1816
02:46:06,261 --> 02:46:08,931
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.

1817
02:47:32,511 --> 02:47:34,971
What the hell! Jesus!

1818
02:47:41,981 --> 02:47:43,731
Christ!

1819
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:52,281
Time magazine, the
weekly news magazine,

1820
02:49:53,501 --> 02:49:59,711
September 22nd, 1967,
volume 90, number 12.

1821
02:50:01,041 --> 02:50:03,001
"The war on the horizon.

1822
02:50:03,291 --> 02:50:05,371
"The American people may
find it hard to believe"

1823
02:50:05,461 --> 02:50:08,291
"that the US is winning
the war in Vietnam."

1824
02:50:09,091 --> 02:50:13,131
"Nevertheless, one of the
most exhaustive inquiries"

1825
02:50:13,421 --> 02:50:16,011
"into the status of the
conflict yet compiled"

1826
02:50:16,381 --> 02:50:19,551
"offers considerable evidence
that the weight of US power,"

1827
02:50:19,681 --> 02:50:24,481
"two and a half years after the big buildup
began, is beginning to make itself felt."

1828
02:50:25,481 --> 02:50:29,361
"White House officials maintain
the impact of that strength"

1829
02:50:30,771 --> 02:50:32,861
"may bring the enemy
to the point"

1830
02:50:32,981 --> 02:50:36,701
"where he could simply be
unable to continue fighting."

1831
02:50:39,371 --> 02:50:40,991
Is this familiar?

1832
02:50:42,241 --> 02:50:45,291
"Because Lyndon Johnson
fears that the US public"

1833
02:50:45,541 --> 02:50:48,871
"is in no mood to accept its
optimistic conclusions,"

1834
02:50:49,421 --> 02:50:52,091
"he may never permit the report
to be released in full."

1835
02:50:52,171 --> 02:50:55,381
"Even so, he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings"

1836
02:50:55,881 --> 02:50:58,721
"and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known"

1837
02:50:59,141 --> 02:51:01,761
"to permit experts who
have been working on it"

1838
02:51:02,221 --> 02:51:04,311
"to talk about it
in general terms."

1839
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:08,311
No date, Time magazine.

1840
02:51:22,121 --> 02:51:28,371
"Sir Robert Thompson, who led the victory
over communist guerrillas in Malaya,"

1841
02:51:28,541 --> 02:51:33,001
"is now a Rand Corporation consultant,
recently returned to Vietnam"

1842
02:51:33,091 --> 02:51:35,751
"to sound out the situation
for President Nixon."

1843
02:51:37,091 --> 02:51:38,971
"He told the
President last week"

1844
02:51:39,051 --> 02:51:44,641
"that things felt much better and
smelled much better over there."

1845
02:51:46,561 --> 02:51:48,271
How do they smell
to you, soldier?

1846
02:52:00,951 --> 02:52:05,871
You'll be free. You'll be under guard.
Read these at your leisure.

1847
02:52:07,121 --> 02:52:08,411
Don't lose them.

1848
02:52:08,751 --> 02:52:10,541
Don't try to escape.
You'll be shot.

1849
02:52:12,831 --> 02:52:14,791
We can talk of these
things later.

1850
02:55:34,161 --> 02:55:38,331
"We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men."

1851
02:55:39,041 --> 02:55:44,461
"Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!"

1852
02:55:46,011 --> 02:55:48,551
"Our dried voices, when
We whisper together.

1853
02:55:48,631 --> 02:55:51,971
"Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass.

1854
02:55:53,261 --> 02:55:55,561
-"Or rats' feet over broken glass..."
-He's out there.

1855
02:55:55,641 --> 02:55:57,141
"In our dry cellar..."

1856
02:55:57,771 --> 02:56:03,691
-He's really out there.
-"Shape without form, shade without color,

1857
02:56:05,021 --> 02:56:09,441
"Paralyzed force, gesture
without motion..."

1858
02:56:09,821 --> 02:56:11,361
Do you know what
the man's saying?

1859
02:56:12,701 --> 02:56:14,411
-Do you?
-"Those who have crossed..."

1860
02:56:15,031 --> 02:56:19,041
This is dialectics. It's very simple
dialectics. One through nine,

1861
02:56:19,371 --> 02:56:22,751
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1862
02:56:22,831 --> 02:56:27,211
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1863
02:56:27,301 --> 02:56:29,131
What are you gonna land on? One-quarter?
Three-eighths?

1864
02:56:29,221 --> 02:56:31,841
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1865
02:56:32,051 --> 02:56:33,971
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1866
02:56:34,051 --> 02:56:36,141
Dialectic logic is, "There's
only love and hate."

1867
02:56:36,221 --> 02:56:38,271
You either love somebody
or you hate them.

1868
02:56:38,731 --> 02:56:39,811
Mutt!

1869
02:56:42,151 --> 02:56:43,191
You mutt.

1870
02:56:44,231 --> 02:56:49,231
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1871
02:56:49,991 --> 02:56:51,991
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1872
02:56:52,071 --> 02:56:54,411
And with a whimper, I'm
fucking splitting, jack.

1873
02:57:24,231 --> 02:57:26,941
On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him,

1874
02:57:27,071 --> 02:57:28,821
I'd know what to do.

1875
02:57:29,781 --> 02:57:36,451
But it didn't happen. I was in there
with him for days, not under guard.

1876
02:57:37,451 --> 02:57:41,621
I was free. But he knew I
wasn't going anywhere.

1877
02:57:43,081 --> 02:57:46,381
He knew more about what I
was going to do than I did.

1878
02:57:53,471 --> 02:57:56,971
If the generals back in Nha
Trang could see what I saw,

1879
02:57:57,931 --> 02:58:00,511
would they still
want me to kill him?

1880
02:58:01,771 --> 02:58:03,641
More than ever, probably.

1881
02:58:05,101 --> 02:58:07,021
And what would his
people back home want,

1882
02:58:07,111 --> 02:58:10,151
if they ever learned just how
far from them he'd really gone?

1883
02:58:12,741 --> 02:58:16,151
He broke from them, and
then he broke from himself.

1884
02:58:17,821 --> 02:58:21,991
I'd never seen a man so
broken up and ripped apart.

1885
02:58:23,001 --> 02:58:27,121
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1886
02:58:29,791 --> 02:58:33,711
But you have no right to call me a
murderer. You have a right to kill me.

1887
02:58:35,051 --> 02:58:41,011
You have a right to do that. But
you have no right to judge me.

1888
02:58:48,351 --> 02:58:53,361
It's impossible for
words to describe

1889
02:58:55,701 --> 02:59:01,661
what is necessary to those

1890
02:59:03,371 --> 02:59:09,041
who do not know
what horror means.

1891
02:59:11,501 --> 02:59:12,711
Horror.

1892
02:59:15,721 --> 02:59:18,341
Horror has a face.

1893
02:59:20,641 --> 02:59:22,761
And you must make a
friend of horror.

1894
02:59:24,471 --> 02:59:29,311
Horror and moral terror
are your friends.

1895
02:59:29,901 --> 02:59:34,691
If they are not, then they
are enemies to be feared.

1896
02:59:36,191 --> 02:59:38,071
They are truly enemies.

1897
02:59:43,081 --> 02:59:45,911
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

1898
02:59:50,421 --> 02:59:54,341
It seems a thousand
centuries ago.

1899
02:59:57,921 --> 03:00:03,761
We went into a camp to
inoculate some children.

1900
03:00:08,351 --> 03:00:13,901
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1901
03:00:16,361 --> 03:00:19,741
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1902
03:00:23,321 --> 03:00:25,871
We went back there

1903
03:00:25,951 --> 03:00:31,421
and they had come and hacked
off every inoculated arm.

1904
03:00:33,791 --> 03:00:40,591
There they were, in a pile.
A pile of little arms.

1905
03:00:42,721 --> 03:00:44,971
And I remember,

1906
03:00:48,851 --> 03:00:51,641
I cried. I wept like

1907
03:00:53,311 --> 03:00:55,981
some grandmother.

1908
03:00:58,651 --> 03:01:01,901
I wanted to tear my teeth out. I
didn't know what I wanted to do.

1909
03:01:03,661 --> 03:01:05,911
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1910
03:01:06,781 --> 03:01:08,621
I never want to forget.

1911
03:01:10,291 --> 03:01:15,001
And then I realized,
like I was shot,

1912
03:01:15,501 --> 03:01:17,671
like I was shot with a diamond,

1913
03:01:18,881 --> 03:01:22,011
a diamond bullet right
through my forehead.

1914
03:01:24,091 --> 03:01:29,261
And I thought, "My God, the genius of that.
The genius."

1915
03:01:30,681 --> 03:01:33,061
The will to do that,

1916
03:01:34,731 --> 03:01:39,191
perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

1917
03:01:41,781 --> 03:01:43,701
And then I realized

1918
03:01:43,781 --> 03:01:47,371
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1919
03:01:47,451 --> 03:01:51,411
These were not monsters. These
were men, trained cadres.

1920
03:01:52,871 --> 03:01:57,541
These men who fought with their hearts,
who have families, who have children,

1921
03:01:57,631 --> 03:02:01,461
who are filled with love,
but they have the strength,

1922
03:02:03,221 --> 03:02:09,681
the strength to do that.

1923
03:02:10,771 --> 03:02:15,061
If I had 10 divisions
of those men,

1924
03:02:16,151 --> 03:02:19,111
then our troubles here would
be over very quickly.

1925
03:02:20,901 --> 03:02:25,321
You have to have
men who are moral,

1926
03:02:27,661 --> 03:02:31,701
and at the same
time, who are able

1927
03:02:33,331 --> 03:02:39,581
to utilize their primordial
instincts to kill

1928
03:02:41,501 --> 03:02:48,091
without feeling, without passion,
without judgment. Without judgment.

1929
03:02:53,601 --> 03:02:56,231
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

1930
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:22,501
I worry that my son might not
understand what I've tried to be.

1931
03:03:25,211 --> 03:03:29,841
And if I were to be
killed, Willard,

1932
03:03:31,391 --> 03:03:36,851
I would want someone to go to my
home and tell my son everything.

1933
03:03:40,151 --> 03:03:43,151
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

1934
03:03:44,901 --> 03:03:50,411
Because there's nothing that I
detest more than the stench of lies.

1935
03:03:53,491 --> 03:04:00,501
And if you understand me,
Willard, you will do this for me.

1936
03:05:07,021 --> 03:05:09,191
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Over.

1937
03:05:10,991 --> 03:05:14,111
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.

1938
03:05:16,371 --> 03:05:20,251
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?

1939
03:05:25,581 --> 03:05:28,381
They were gonna make
me a Major for this,

1940
03:05:29,131 --> 03:05:32,261
and I wasn't even in their
fucking Army anymore.

1941
03:05:34,431 --> 03:05:39,141
Everybody wanted me to
do it, him most of all.

1942
03:05:41,101 --> 03:05:45,481
I felt like he was up there, waiting
for me to take the pain away.

1943
03:05:48,821 --> 03:05:52,901
He just wanted to go out like a soldier.
Standing up.

1944
03:05:54,241 --> 03:05:57,821
Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.

1945
03:06:01,701 --> 03:06:04,001
Even the jungle wanted him dead,

1946
03:06:04,961 --> 03:06:07,631
and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.
