1
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,938
Finish work!

2
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,398
Go to hut.

3
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,150
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:37,154
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

5
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:40,449
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:42,659
Dig, dig.

7
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,454
How about putting us
on sick list?

8
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,790
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

9
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,335
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:55,046
Why you always play sick
to me, Shears?

11
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,175
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

12
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,719
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,638
...how about a butt?

14
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,558
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

15
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:10,061
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.

16
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,064
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:17,152
...like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

18
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,280
That's why...

19
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,408
...I want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,247
Think I stole it?

21
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,167
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

22
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,128
He willed it to me
for a favor I'd done him.

23
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,340
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

24
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,134
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:46,973
Okay, you go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,978
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

27
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,855
...then where'll we be?

28
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,860
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,154
Far away.

30
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,865
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,619
Here lies...

32
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,248
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,749
Thomson.

34
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,292
Yes.

35
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,586
Here lies
Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:20,549
...serial number 01234567.

37
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:25,762
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:30,559
...who died of beriberi
in the year of our Lord, 1943...

39
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,270
...for the greater glory of...

40
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,648
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

41
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,150
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,445
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:45,574
May he rest in peace.

44
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,162
He found little enough of it
while he was alive.

45
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:50,365
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,215
Mark time!

47
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,624
Halt.

48
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:28,880
Into line, left turn.

49
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,092
Stand easy.

50
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,311
We're gonna be a busy pair
of gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:45,814
Well done, well done.

52
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,951
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

53
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:01,454
- You gonna tell him the truth?
- Of course not.

54
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,748
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

55
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,950
My name is Nicholson.

56
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,120
I am Colonel Saito.

57
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,803
In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...

58
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,889
...I welcome you.

59
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:05,059
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

60
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,313
...which is Camp 16...

61
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,857
...along the great railroad...

62
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:16,487
...which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

63
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:21,784
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

64
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:25,204
...to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

65
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,418
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

66
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:35,632
And officers will work
as well as men.

67
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:41,095
The Japanese army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

68
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:46,309
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

69
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,104
But if you do not work hard...

70
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:52,899
...you will be punished.

71
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,820
A word to you about escape.

72
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,157
There is no barbed wire.

73
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,451
No stockade.

74
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,453
No watchtower.

75
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,123
They are not necessary.

76
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,043
We are an island in the jungle.

77
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,213
Escape is impossible.

78
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,257
You would die.

79
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,888
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

80
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:30,144
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

81
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,271
"Be happy in your work."

82
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,941
Be happy in your work.

83
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:38,945
Dismissed.

84
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:47,161
Battalion, stand at ease.

85
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,830
Fall out, Major Hughes.

86
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,207
Battalion, stand easy.

87
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,502
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

88
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm gonna have a word
with this fellow. Colonel!

89
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:05,388
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

90
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,350
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

91
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,937
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

92
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:17,275
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labor...

93
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,861
...is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

94
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,404
Is that so?

95
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,322
I have a copy of the Convention...

96
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,534
...and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

97
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,162
That will not be necessary.

98
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,458
Sit down, please.

99
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,510
Yes, sir.

100
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,222
- I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
- Very good, sir.

101
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,517
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

102
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,561
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.

103
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:19,730
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

104
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,691
- Good.
- How do you do, sir?

105
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,359
We found him and an Australian.

106
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,028
All that's left of the prisoners
who built the camp.

107
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,864
U.S. Navy? Out here?

108
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,116
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.

109
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,535
<i>- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.</i>

110
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:36,247
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

111
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,874
And your group here?

112
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,334
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

113
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,837
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

114
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,755
And what happened to them?

115
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,382
They died...

116
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:51,804
...of malaria, dysentery,
beriberi, gangrene.

117
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,389
Other causes of death:

118
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:57,643
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

119
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,604
...Saito.

120
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,149
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

121
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,650
Has Clipton seen you?

122
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:08,821
Just about to, sir. Come over here,
commander, you can shave later.

123
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,448
All right.

124
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,911
You'll stay with the officers.

125
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,871
We'll scrape up
some decent clothing.

126
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,539
Don't bother about me.

127
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

128
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,086
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.

129
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:26,464
The officers in your party
did manual labor?

130
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,382
I think you could call it that.

131
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,844
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

132
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,304
<i>Sake .</i>

133
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,682
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?

134
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,977
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

135
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,104
Well, I must be pushing on.

136
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,148
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

137
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,318
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,320
Anything we can do.

139
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,197
Oh, thank you, sir.

140
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,868
- What is it?
- Never mind.

141
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,912
Go on, say it.

142
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,873
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

143
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,585
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

144
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,922
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson
defines the word differently.

145
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,099
Any other points?

146
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,934
- By your leave, sir?
- Yes, Jennings?

147
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,229
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears...

148
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,314
There won't be any
escape committee.

149
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,150
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.

150
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,153
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

151
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:35,783
Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

152
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:40,037
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.

153
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,417
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

154
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,296
I'd say the odds against a
successful escape are 100 to one.

155
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,548
- Right.
- But may I add another word?

156
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:51,966
Please.

157
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,386
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

158
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,514
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

159
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,141
To give up hope of escape...

160
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:03,728
...to stop thinking about it,
is like accepting a death sentence.

161
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,564
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

162
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,693
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

163
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,987
I understand how you feel.

164
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:18,117
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

165
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,245
But my men and I are involved
in a curious legal point...

166
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:23,664
...of which you are unaware.

167
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,585
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

168
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,503
Ordered, mind you.

169
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:33,466
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

170
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,801
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir, interesting point.

171
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,554
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

172
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:42,433
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

173
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,311
Without law, commander,
there is no civilization.

174
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,939
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.

175
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,984
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

176
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,321
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

177
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:59,075
Is there anything else?

178
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,871
I think we're all clear
on the program.

179
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,750
I want everything to go off without
a hitch starting tomorrow morning.

180
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,543
And remember this:

181
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,880
Our men must always feel
they are still commanded by us...

182
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,049
...and not by the Japanese.

183
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,553
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

184
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,889
Are you with me there, commander?

185
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,018
Well, l...

186
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,522
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,899
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,484
A living slave.

189
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,750
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

190
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,003
He's been in isolation too long,
poorchap.

191
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:57,341
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,775
English prisoners!

193
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:20,614
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:26,704
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,169
You will finish the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

196
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:38,215
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,681
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,976
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,978
This is only just...

200
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:55,232
...for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,068
Your shame is their dishonor.

202
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,779
It is they who told you...

203
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:05,618
...better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

204
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,121
It is they who brought you here,
not I.

205
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:14,835
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labor.

206
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,129
That is all.

207
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:21,425
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,220
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:33,187
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

210
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,106
...to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,485
"Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

212
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,779
...who are fit,
other than officers..."

213
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,280
Give me the book.

214
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,116
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

215
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,452
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

216
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,956
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,166
You see, the Code states that...

218
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,420
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,507
You speak to me of code?

220
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:04,260
What code?

221
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,679
The coward's code!

222
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,432
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

223
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,852
Of Bushido? Nothing!

224
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,564
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,538
Since you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized world...

226
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:36,417
...we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,920
My officers will not
do manual labor.

228
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,880
We shall see.

229
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:48,887
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,693
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.

231
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,614
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:13,704
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

233
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,709
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

234
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,379
Eyes right.

235
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,382
Eyes right.

236
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,975
Eyes front.

237
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,316
Eyes right.

238
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:47,071
Quick march, eyes right.

239
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,043
"C" Company, by the right.

240
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,087
What's he up to?

241
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:08,550
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

242
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,444
Now, you will be reasonable.

243
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,948
You will order your officers to work.

244
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,658
No.

245
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,691
I will count three.

246
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,901
If by the third count...

247
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:12,573
...you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

248
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:15,492
...I will give the order to fire.

249
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,171
He's going to do it.

250
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,215
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

251
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,894
One.

252
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,604
I warn you, Colonel Saito.

253
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,355
Two.

254
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,735
Stop!

255
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,618
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

256
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,745
So has every man in the hospital.

257
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,455
There are too many witnesses.

258
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:05,626
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

259
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,965
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

260
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:28,125
You see, Jennings, there are certain
advantages to being on the sick list.

261
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:31,295
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

262
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,797
"Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

263
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,465
How's that, sir?

264
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,634
That kind of guts.

265
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,636
Also the kind they had in 1914...

266
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,556
...when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

267
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,059
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.

268
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,187
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

269
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,607
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

270
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,778
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

271
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,072
What about him?

272
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,742
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

273
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:48,830
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

274
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,541
Here we go again.

275
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:05,097
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

276
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,182
Tell them to go.

277
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,900
Not you.

278
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,082
Come.

279
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,896
Leave him alone!

280
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,400
Leave him alone!

281
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,330
They're gonna put him in the oven.

282
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:20,232
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

283
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,152
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

284
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,696
<i>And so say all of us</i>

285
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:31,701
<i>And so say all of us
And so say all of us</i>

286
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,040
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

287
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,794
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

288
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,338
<i>And so say all of us</i>

289
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,843
Timber!

290
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,977
One, two, three, four.

291
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,232
One, two, three, four.

292
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,861
No, no, no!

293
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,863
Let go!

294
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,700
Let go!

295
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,416
You wish to see me?

296
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,918
I've been trying to see you
for three days.

297
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,213
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut...

298
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,427
I could have you shot.

299
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:22,265
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

300
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,351
I knew nothing about the escape.

301
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,187
It does not matter.

302
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,315
One must even respect
those who tried.

303
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:34,319
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

304
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,279
...they were soldiers again.

305
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:41,451
But it is insane to try and escape.

306
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,955
Two soldiers shot,
the third drowned.

307
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,665
To what end?

308
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,752
It was an escape from reality.

309
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,762
There is your reality.

310
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:05,767
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

311
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,854
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

312
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,442
Because of your
colonel's stubbornness...

313
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,778
...we are far behind schedule.

314
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,071
That is not all.

315
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,574
Enlisted prisoners
sabotaged the work.

316
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:25,745
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

317
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,623
Then who would build your bridge?

318
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,834
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

319
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,129
Perhaps the men don't work well
without their own officers.

320
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:39,175
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

321
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,304
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.

322
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,640
Do not speak to me of rules.

323
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,684
This is war!

324
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,019
This is not a game of cricket.

325
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,651
He's mad, your colonel...

326
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,029
...quite mad.

327
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,534
Sit down, please.

328
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:13,418
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

329
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,128
Thank you.

330
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,841
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

331
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,052
...I'll be forced
to close the hospital...

332
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:26,681
...and your patients will
work in their place.

333
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:31,269
And many will die,
and he will be responsible.

334
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,982
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

335
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,639
Hey, the doc's going
to see the old man.

336
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,769
Sir...

337
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:18,608
It's Clipton, sir.

338
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,612
I brought you a few things.

339
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:30,453
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.

340
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:34,874
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

341
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,546
And the officers?

342
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,507
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.

343
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:46,970
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.

344
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:49,722
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.

345
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:53,434
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

346
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:58,147
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

347
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,567
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?

348
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,653
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

349
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,451
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

350
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,829
I've got something to tell you.

351
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,540
I've just had a word with Saito.

352
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:19,460
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

353
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:23,548
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

354
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,232
Blackmail.

355
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:46,112
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

356
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:49,991
It's a question of face,
pure and simple. And he can't give in.

357
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,577
It's still blackmail.

358
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:59,334
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

359
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:04,756
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

360
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,011
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

361
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:13,306
But Saito's cut their food rations...

362
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,642
...and if he makes
the sick men work...

363
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:19,729
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

364
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,732
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

365
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,526
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

366
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:29,572
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

367
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:37,080
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

368
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,792
We're under the heel of a man
who'll stop at nothing to get his way.

369
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,001
Principle!

370
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:46,381
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

371
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,133
Give in, sir. Please!

372
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,843
I'm adamant.

373
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:54,806
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

374
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:57,100
- Time.
- All right.

375
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,522
Please thank those concerned.

376
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:05,650
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

377
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,527
Reynolds stole the coconut.

378
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,989
We'll be able to get you
something from time to time.

379
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,617
We've bribed one of your guards.

380
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,836
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

381
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,629
Many thanks.

382
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,720
- Clipton!
- Yes, sir?

383
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,639
Did you say that American chap
was killed?

384
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:39,016
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

385
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,604
It's insane to plan escapes.

386
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,692
Three men killed, and to what end?

387
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,944
- Time!
- Here.

388
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:52,488
- Here is where we must win through.
- Time, time!

389
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:16,763
The doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

390
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,558
Means only one thing,
colonel won't give in.

391
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:34,655
Well?

392
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,574
It's like this.

393
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,494
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

394
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,871
It's a question of principle.

395
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:45,583
As medical officer, I protest
to the way he's being treated.

396
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,794
It's a wonder he's still alive.

397
00:43:48,002 --> 00:43:52,006
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

398
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,385
He is responsible.

399
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:59,055
Not I.

400
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:10,942
You sick?

401
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:16,781
Are they both mad?

402
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:20,326
Or am I going mad?

403
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:23,704
Or is it the sun?

404
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:27,805
Attention!

405
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:31,767
Battalion, attention.

406
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,772
English prisoners.

407
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,483
Let us ask the question...

408
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:42,903
...why does the bridge not progress?

409
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:48,617
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

410
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:53,247
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

411
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,791
This is not just.

412
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:59,211
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

413
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:03,424
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

414
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:06,218
But there is another cause.

415
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,513
I do not hide the truth.

416
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:12,641
With deep shame and regret...

417
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,186
...I admit to you the failure...

418
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:18,272
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

419
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,733
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

420
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:23,402
He is a bad engineer.

421
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:25,905
He is unworthy of command.

422
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:30,868
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

423
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:36,665
Tomorrow we begin again.

424
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,377
I shall be in personal command.

425
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:42,963
Today we rest.

426
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:49,553
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy.

427
00:48:50,054 --> 00:48:53,516
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

428
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:56,310
...I give presents to you all.

429
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,033
Let us be happy in our work.

430
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,703
Company, dismissed.

431
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,583
Battalion, dismissed.

432
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:36,225
Hey, take a look at this.

433
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:38,519
Red Cross! He's given us our...

434
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:42,523
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

435
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:46,068
"Tomorrow we begin again."

436
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,135
Hey, Harry, look.

437
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,596
They're letting the old man out.

438
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:21,163
Most likely gonna give him
another pasting.

439
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:06,959
Good evening, colonel.

440
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:16,010
Do you mind sitting over here?

441
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:19,763
I am having rather a late supper.

442
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:45,205
English corned beef.

443
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:47,708
No, thank you.

444
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:55,549
Produce of Scotland.

445
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:59,511
I prefer it to <i>sake.</i>

446
00:53:00,012 --> 00:53:02,681
I spent three years in London,
you know.

447
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,602
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

448
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,563
Cheers.

449
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,440
Sorry.

450
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:13,484
Later, perhaps?

451
00:53:13,734 --> 00:53:15,361
Perhaps.

452
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,285
I was not a good artist.

453
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:25,829
My father disapproved.

454
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,499
He felt I belonged in the army.

455
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:33,295
So I changed from art
to engineering.

456
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:38,092
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

457
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,096
I intend to make a full report
of your activities in this camp.

458
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:51,230
I do not think you quite
realize my position.

459
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,858
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.

460
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:59,154
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

461
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:02,157
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.

462
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:07,121
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

463
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:10,207
But no officers, except in
an administrative capacity.

464
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:14,586
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

465
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:16,505
You know it. I know it.

466
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:19,591
I'm not responsible
for the actions of other officers.

467
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,301
Personally, I'm appalled.

468
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,929
Let's not get excited.

469
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,061
Will you have a cigar?

470
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,272
No. Thank you.

471
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,777
When I said all officers must work...

472
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:42,448
...naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

473
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:46,785
My orders were only intended
for officers below...

474
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,288
None of my officers
will do manual labor.

475
00:54:49,455 --> 00:54:52,749
Please! I was about to say:

476
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:56,336
I've been thinking the matter over
and have decided...

477
00:54:56,545 --> 00:55:01,049
...to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

478
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:04,052
...leaving only junior officers
to lend a hand.

479
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:07,806
I'm afraid not. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

480
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:26,158
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

481
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:28,076
I haven't the foggiest.

482
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:30,913
I'd have to kill myself.

483
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:34,082
What would you do if you were me?

484
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:37,169
I suppose if I were you...

485
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:40,088
...I'd have to kill myself.

486
00:55:42,216 --> 00:55:43,509
Cheers.

487
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,304
I warn you, colonel...

488
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:52,017
...if I am to die,
others will die before me.

489
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:53,560
Do you understand that?

490
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:56,396
- Major Clipton did mention that.
- Well?

491
00:55:56,605 --> 00:55:59,107
That won't solve your problem.

492
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:01,777
But I'm sure we can arrive
at a proper solution.

493
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:03,654
Please sit down.

494
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:10,327
Now, tell me, colonel...

495
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:14,331
...do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

496
00:56:14,623 --> 00:56:16,458
- Of course.
- Good.

497
00:56:18,961 --> 00:56:20,212
Now...

498
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:24,716
Take this bridge of yours.

499
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,594
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

500
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:31,890
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether
your lieutenant... What's his name?

501
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:34,518
- Miura.
- Miura.

502
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:38,897
...Is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

503
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:44,528
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

504
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:48,490
...who have built bridges
all over India.

505
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:51,201
The men respect them.

506
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:54,997
It's essential for an officer to have
that respect, I'm sure you agree.

507
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:56,957
If he loses it,
he ceases to command.

508
00:56:57,165 --> 00:57:00,168
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.

509
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:03,797
A pretty poor commander I would be
if I allowed that to happen.

510
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:05,882
Perhaps you are not aware...

511
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:09,303
...that the bridge is now
under my personal command.

512
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:13,265
Really? And may I ask,
are you satisfied with the work?

513
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:15,767
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.

514
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:18,312
I hate the British!

515
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,690
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

516
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,359
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

517
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,279
You endure
but you have no courage.

518
00:57:27,446 --> 00:57:29,615
I hate the British!

519
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:32,534
Pointless, going on like this.

520
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:34,119
Stay there!

521
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:13,338
Stand down. Stand down!

522
01:01:22,848 --> 01:01:25,350
Battalion, attention!

523
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:08,101
Battalion, stand at ease.

524
01:02:10,562 --> 01:02:12,147
Please...

525
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:16,318
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

526
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:18,361
I'm afraid I've lost count.

527
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:21,323
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

528
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:24,326
- ...over Russia in 1905.
- Oh, yes.

529
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:28,580
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

530
01:02:28,747 --> 01:02:30,749
In honor of this occasion...

531
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,752
...I have given your troops
a day of rest.

532
01:02:33,919 --> 01:02:35,170
Many thanks.

533
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:38,506
I am declaring a general amnesty.

534
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:42,218
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

535
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,721
As part of this amnesty...

536
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:50,393
...it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labor.

537
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:21,633
He's done it!

538
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,986
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

539
01:05:58,623 --> 01:06:00,250
How many men in your party?

540
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,627
Well, I don't really know, sir.

541
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:05,130
- You don't know?
- Sir, 12, usually.

542
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:09,676
But, well, one of the men took sick
very suddenly this morning, sir.

543
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:12,303
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

544
01:06:13,972 --> 01:06:17,642
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

545
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:21,604
A corporal should always know
how many men he has under him.

546
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:24,107
Oh, yes, sir.

547
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:28,945
Have you a nervous affliction? If not,
stop making those faces at once.

548
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:34,492
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behavior.

549
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:35,994
No, sir.

550
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,666
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

551
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:43,459
Yes, sir.

552
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:54,762
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?

553
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:58,516
You ever constructed a bridge
across a stream like the Kwai?

554
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:02,353
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them,
in Madras, Bengal...

555
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,564
If this were your bridge...

556
01:07:05,356 --> 01:07:07,483
...how would you get it under way?

557
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,237
Get it under way, sir?

558
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:14,115
Well, first of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

559
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:16,451
Oh, why not'?

560
01:07:16,618 --> 01:07:18,369
As I was trying to tell you...

561
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,790
...the Japanese couldn't have picked
a worse location. There's no bottom.

562
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,210
You see those piles?

563
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,086
They're sinking.

564
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:33,343
Our chaps could drive those logs
till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.

565
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:35,637
Where would you build it?

566
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:39,849
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

567
01:07:40,016 --> 01:07:42,936
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

568
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,941
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

569
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:52,445
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.

570
01:07:54,364 --> 01:07:56,532
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.

571
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:58,368
No teamwork.

572
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:03,164
Some of those parties are actually
working against each other.

573
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,709
Yes.

574
01:08:10,046 --> 01:08:13,383
I tell you, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

575
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:16,386
Thanks to the Japanese,
we now command a rabble.

576
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:19,013
There's no order, no discipline.

577
01:08:20,348 --> 01:08:23,434
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

578
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,436
Which isn't going to be easy.

579
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:29,274
But fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

580
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:31,943
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.

581
01:08:34,362 --> 01:08:39,033
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that will put them to shame.

582
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,953
We'll show them what
the British soldier is capable of.

583
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,872
Yes. I see your point, sir.

584
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:47,875
I realize how difficult
it's going to be here...

585
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,545
...where you can't find
what you need.

586
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:53,881
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

587
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,592
You mean, you really want them
to build the bridge?

588
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,470
You're not usually
so slow on the uptake, Evans.

589
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,598
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

590
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:05,977
Fact is, if there weren't any work,
we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?

591
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:09,063
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

592
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:11,816
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

593
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,193
Here again I know the men.

594
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:17,447
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

595
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:19,282
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

596
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,410
Reeves, you're the key man
in this situation, as engineer.

597
01:09:22,577 --> 01:09:26,581
Tell me what you want and we'll
organize it. Can we make a go of it?

598
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:29,083
- We'll do our best, sir.
- Fine.

599
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:32,628
We must draw up our plans...

600
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,965
...then arrange a conference
with Saito...

601
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:38,676
...and set him straight.

602
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,144
Well, I think that takes care of all
the procedural matters. Now...

603
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:49,937
Oh, yes.

604
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:54,359
The next point is somewhat unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

605
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:58,237
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

606
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:00,782
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

607
01:10:03,326 --> 01:10:04,702
Incorrectly?

608
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,454
Unfortunately, yes.

609
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:09,374
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

610
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:12,960
...and has concluded that
the river bottom there is too soft.

611
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:15,046
Too soft?

612
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:17,757
Mud. All the work up to now
has been useless.

613
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:21,010
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.

614
01:10:21,177 --> 01:10:23,679
Colonel, I've made tests.
Those piles of yours...

615
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:26,557
...could be hammered below
water level before they'd hold.

616
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,519
That bridge would collapse
under the first train.

617
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:33,856
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

618
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:36,567
Just a moment, Reeves,
before you get too involved.

619
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:39,320
Colonel, do you suppose
we could have a cup of tea?

620
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:56,379
Then I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

621
01:10:56,546 --> 01:10:59,257
...we build a new bridge,
at the site picked by Reeves...

622
01:10:59,424 --> 01:11:01,884
...400 yards downstream.

623
01:11:05,263 --> 01:11:07,723
So let's proceed to the next point.

624
01:11:08,558 --> 01:11:11,269
I've decided to alter
the daily work quota of our men.

625
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:13,229
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it.

626
01:11:13,396 --> 01:11:15,982
From a yard and a half
of earth moved to two.

627
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:19,026
I was sure it would meet
with your approval.

628
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:22,530
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?

629
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,783
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito,
of the entire project.

630
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,787
As you can see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

631
01:11:29,954 --> 01:11:33,833
I would strongly urge we revise the
organization of the working parties.

632
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:39,255
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

633
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:41,966
Would it be possible
to have a meal served here?

634
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:43,384
Of course.

635
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:45,261
If we...

636
01:11:46,846 --> 01:11:48,389
- Carry on, Hughes.
- Yes, sir.

637
01:11:48,598 --> 01:11:52,059
If we increase the number of squads
and specialize their functions...

638
01:11:52,477 --> 01:11:57,023
...I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30 percent.

639
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:00,485
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point...

640
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:06,282
Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.

641
01:12:06,449 --> 01:12:08,868
As most of the British
will work on the bridge...

642
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:11,996
...only a small number will be available
for railway work.

643
01:12:12,246 --> 01:12:17,168
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

644
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:21,964
...so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

645
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,510
I have already given the order.

646
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,846
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

647
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:33,059
I thought of setting it at a yard
and a half so as not to overtire them...

648
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:35,978
...but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

649
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:39,482
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

650
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,654
I have already given the order.

651
01:12:44,904 --> 01:12:47,448
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.

652
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,660
I think that completes
the agenda for this evening.

653
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,330
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

654
01:12:54,622 --> 01:12:57,458
And are there any other questions?

655
01:12:58,918 --> 01:13:00,545
One question.

656
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:03,714
Can you finish the bridge in time?

657
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:07,468
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

658
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:10,137
But we'll certainly give it a go.

659
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:15,685
We mustn't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

660
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:17,770
...for which I was not to blame.

661
01:13:19,397 --> 01:13:21,190
Is there anything else?

662
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,067
No.

663
01:13:23,693 --> 01:13:27,655
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

664
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:31,409
- Good night.
- Good night.

665
01:13:55,558 --> 01:13:59,979
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

666
01:14:00,688 --> 01:14:03,941
For the moment, I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

667
01:14:04,734 --> 01:14:07,486
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.

668
01:14:09,614 --> 01:14:11,699
By the way, I meant to tell you...

669
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,785
...there are trees in this forest
very similar to elm.

670
01:14:14,994 --> 01:14:18,205
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

671
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,293
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.

672
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:25,630
Six hundred years.

673
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,341
That would be quite something.

674
01:15:17,264 --> 01:15:21,143
Good morning. I'm looking for an
American named Commander Shears.

675
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:24,647
- Oh, yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.

676
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:33,614
Kiss!

677
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,325
Too many eyes.

678
01:15:36,617 --> 01:15:40,830
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

679
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:42,498
...when all I need is love.

680
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:45,501
It's true.
All you really need is love.

681
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:53,467
What makes you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

682
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,970
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

683
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,347
And I always follow my heart.

684
01:15:58,597 --> 01:15:59,890
Kiss.

685
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:10,526
How's that, commander?

686
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:13,237
Don't call me commander.

687
01:16:13,446 --> 01:16:14,822
It's unromantic.

688
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:16,824
You're an officer yourself.

689
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:19,952
How would you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

690
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:22,663
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

691
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:23,998
Yes, sir.

692
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,334
Brass ahoy.

693
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:29,920
He wants to see you. He's all yours.

694
01:16:30,129 --> 01:16:32,631
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.

695
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:35,843
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

696
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,845
My name's Warden.

697
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,889
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...

698
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:42,516
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.

699
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:43,809
Like a martini?

700
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:45,811
That's very kind, but I think not.

701
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:47,313
- Mind if I have one?
- No.

702
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,856
How did you get that?

703
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:52,026
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

704
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:55,154
Oh, yes, of course. Jolly good.

705
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,073
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

706
01:16:58,365 --> 01:17:01,869
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 316.

707
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:04,580
Our headquarters is up
in the Botanical Gardens.

708
01:17:04,872 --> 01:17:08,083
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.

709
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:11,170
- Sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.

710
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:15,382
We have a particular interest
in that railway you worked on.

711
01:17:15,633 --> 01:17:18,928
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

712
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:22,681
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

713
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:26,060
...and I've already told your people
everything I know.

714
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:29,605
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

715
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,524
I know it's a terrible imposition...

716
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:34,985
...but I wonder if you could possibly
come out and see us.

717
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:39,365
Well, if you want to go over
the whole thing again.

718
01:17:39,532 --> 01:17:42,243
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.

719
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:43,869
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.

720
01:17:44,036 --> 01:17:46,664
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- Oh, I see.

721
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:50,376
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.

722
01:17:50,543 --> 01:17:52,920
This evening? Out of the question.

723
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:55,464
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?

724
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:58,175
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.

725
01:17:58,425 --> 01:18:00,636
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

726
01:18:00,845 --> 01:18:02,096
Good luck.

727
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,181
Thanks.

728
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:16,110
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're
going to stand me up tonight.

729
01:18:16,277 --> 01:18:18,362
You couldn't be more wrong.

730
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,411
General salute!

731
01:18:25,578 --> 01:18:28,080
Present arms!

732
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:44,013
- May I see your pass, sir, please?
- Oh, yes.

733
01:18:44,555 --> 01:18:46,265
Thank you, sir.

734
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,559
Carry on, driver.

735
01:18:56,775 --> 01:18:59,153
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

736
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,113
All right, thanks.

737
01:19:11,707 --> 01:19:15,085
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

738
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:18,839
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man. Use your knife.

739
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:24,261
Good! On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.

740
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:27,014
Come on, move yourselves!
Move! Move quickly!

741
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:33,646
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

742
01:19:34,897 --> 01:19:37,858
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

743
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:40,611
You see, he's gained the initiative.

744
01:19:40,778 --> 01:19:44,740
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

745
01:19:45,032 --> 01:19:47,201
- You're sorry?
- So am I, sir.

746
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:50,746
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.

747
01:19:51,038 --> 01:19:54,917
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

748
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:57,211
What can I do for you, sir?

749
01:19:57,378 --> 01:19:59,296
I was on my way to see
Major Warden.

750
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:03,884
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

751
01:20:10,057 --> 01:20:13,268
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.

752
01:20:13,477 --> 01:20:17,648
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

753
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,236
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

754
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:23,904
Very good of you to come.

755
01:20:24,154 --> 01:20:26,949
- I hope they took care of you.
- They certainly have.

756
01:20:27,116 --> 01:20:30,202
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

757
01:20:30,452 --> 01:20:33,288
Colonel Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

758
01:20:34,707 --> 01:20:37,793
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Utterly charming.

759
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,004
Didn't realize it was
a commando school.

760
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:44,967
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

761
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:46,635
What do you do here?

762
01:20:46,844 --> 01:20:49,263
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

763
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:52,516
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.

764
01:20:52,766 --> 01:20:55,394
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

765
01:20:55,644 --> 01:20:59,106
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
and only half the weight. Here.

766
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:03,318
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

767
01:21:03,694 --> 01:21:05,195
Thanks for telling me.

768
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:08,449
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

769
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:11,452
See? You can do
what you like with it.

770
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:13,954
This is my place.

771
01:21:19,418 --> 01:21:20,836
Go ahead.

772
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:25,424
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

773
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:30,137
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

774
01:21:30,304 --> 01:21:32,514
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

775
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:35,851
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

776
01:21:39,772 --> 01:21:41,148
Do you read this?

777
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:45,235
Oh, I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

778
01:21:49,156 --> 01:21:52,743
I never congratulated you
on your escape. It was a good show.

779
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:56,872
I was lucky. If your sea-rescue plane
hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

780
01:21:57,039 --> 01:21:58,791
No, I suppose not.

781
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:04,671
Would you like to see
where you were?

782
01:22:05,714 --> 01:22:07,299
All right.

783
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:11,762
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.

784
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:13,806
But we think the camp is about here.

785
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:18,519
Say, do your people have any idea
what happened to Colonel Nicholson?

786
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:22,272
He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

787
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,609
If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.

788
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:30,364
Here is the River Kwai, and here is
the village where you were helped.

789
01:22:30,531 --> 01:22:32,199
And here is the railway.

790
01:22:32,366 --> 01:22:35,077
But then you must be fairly familiar
with all this area.

791
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,871
Not really, I was out of my head
half the time.

792
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:41,708
The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya...

793
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:46,797
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.

794
01:22:47,047 --> 01:22:50,509
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.

795
01:22:50,759 --> 01:22:52,845
The Japanese aim to open...

796
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,722
...the Bangkok-Rangoon section
by the middle of May.

797
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:58,058
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.

798
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:01,145
It's too far for bombers
to carry an adequate load.

799
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:03,730
We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.

800
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:06,567
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop, then march.

801
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,736
With demolition equipment
through that jungle?

802
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,324
Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.

803
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:17,119
You see, none of us have
ever been there.

804
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:20,581
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.

805
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:22,708
Colonel Green's given me
the Kwai bridge.

806
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,752
I'm gonna take a team in
and blow it up.

807
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:28,046
Lucky you.

808
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,259
Sure you won't have tea?

809
01:23:32,426 --> 01:23:37,055
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,
but I've got a luncheon date at 2.

810
01:23:37,264 --> 01:23:40,976
- So if there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.

811
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,815
Well, there is only
one question, actually.

812
01:23:47,274 --> 01:23:49,526
How would you feel
about going back?

813
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:52,821
Come again?

814
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:56,700
I know, under the circumstances,
it's a bit much...

815
01:23:56,909 --> 01:24:00,078
...but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.

816
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:02,122
And we'd love to have you with us.

817
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:06,460
That's why you brought me here?

818
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,212
To ask me this?

819
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:10,172
Well, frankly, yes.

820
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,634
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.

821
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,428
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!

822
01:24:16,637 --> 01:24:17,930
This is embarrassing...

823
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:21,850
I can't go back! I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

824
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:26,021
Actually, Colonel Green has taken
the matter up with your people.

825
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:30,067
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.

826
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:34,071
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from your CINC Pacific...

827
01:24:34,321 --> 01:24:38,367
...authorizing your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 316.

828
01:24:38,617 --> 01:24:41,411
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.

829
01:24:42,204 --> 01:24:44,498
It was difficult to know how
to break it to you.

830
01:24:44,665 --> 01:24:49,169
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake.

831
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:57,094
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

832
01:24:57,386 --> 01:25:02,516
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an
ordinary swab jockey, second class.

833
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:09,106
When the Houston sunk, I made
it ashore with a real commander.

834
01:25:09,356 --> 01:25:12,526
Later on, we ran into
a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

835
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:16,154
I figured it was just a matter of time
before I was captured...

836
01:25:16,363 --> 01:25:19,199
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

837
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,119
I thought officers would get
better treatment.

838
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:23,453
That's very sensible.

839
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:27,207
But at Saito's camp, the officers
worked along with the rest.

840
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:30,002
Yes, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

841
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:35,507
I kind of got used
to being a commander...

842
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:39,052
...so when I arrived here
at the hospital...

843
01:25:39,219 --> 01:25:43,390
...I took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward...

844
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:48,228
...and I said to myself,
"Let's let it ride along for a while."

845
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:50,188
There were certain advantages.

846
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:52,274
I saw one of them on the beach.

847
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:54,735
Anyway, that's the whole story.

848
01:25:54,901 --> 01:25:58,905
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer...

849
01:25:59,114 --> 01:26:01,992
...an American commander
named Shears who doesn't exist.

850
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,411
When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:

851
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:07,748
"Ship him home in irons
for impersonating an officer."

852
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:11,543
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?

853
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:15,005
- Made. I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.

854
01:26:15,505 --> 01:26:17,758
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

855
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:20,135
I'll tell them
I impersonated an officer...

856
01:26:20,302 --> 01:26:22,929
...because I went off my rocker
in the jungle.

857
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:28,226
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

858
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:30,687
It's quite a clever plan.

859
01:26:31,772 --> 01:26:34,024
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.

860
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:36,610
If my Navy finds out who I am...

861
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,864
...those temporary orders won't be
worth the paper they're written on.

862
01:26:54,586 --> 01:26:56,463
This is your photograph, isn't it?

863
01:26:59,466 --> 01:27:02,177
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing...

864
01:27:02,469 --> 01:27:04,846
...because your people
couldn't identify you.

865
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:09,893
Finally your CINC Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.

866
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:14,147
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?

867
01:27:14,815 --> 01:27:15,982
No.

868
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:20,487
You see, we've known about
your actual rank for nearly a week.

869
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:25,992
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

870
01:27:26,201 --> 01:27:28,412
In one sense you're a blasted hero...

871
01:27:28,662 --> 01:27:31,331
...for making an escape
from the jungle.

872
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,501
But at the same time,
they can't bring you home...

873
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:38,213
...and give you the Navy Cross
for impersonating an officer.

874
01:27:38,422 --> 01:27:41,800
I suppose that's why they were
so happy to hand you over to us.

875
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,635
You see?

876
01:27:43,844 --> 01:27:45,011
Hot potato.

877
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:48,223
As far as your present rank
is concerned...

878
01:27:48,432 --> 01:27:51,601
...we're fairly informal
about those things in Force 316.

879
01:27:51,852 --> 01:27:54,229
You'd have the simulated
rank of major.

880
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:59,276
Simulated major. That figures.

881
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:02,195
Well...

882
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:08,827
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

883
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:11,037
Good show!

884
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:14,207
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

885
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:19,754
This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.

886
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:21,381
Really?

887
01:28:22,466 --> 01:28:24,134
Good show!

888
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:27,220
Jolly good show, major!

889
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:19,439
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.

890
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,816
The colonel might think
I'm malingering.

891
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:24,778
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.

892
01:29:30,617 --> 01:29:34,454
Will someone tell me why the old man
wants us to build a proper bridge?

893
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:38,124
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

894
01:29:48,552 --> 01:29:52,722
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.

895
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:55,559
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.

896
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:58,144
Yes. How's he behaving?

897
01:29:58,395 --> 01:30:01,147
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

898
01:30:01,356 --> 01:30:04,234
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.

899
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:06,486
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

900
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,572
What do you think?

901
01:30:10,282 --> 01:30:12,158
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

902
01:30:14,286 --> 01:30:18,665
Sir, are you convinced that
building this bridge is a good idea?

903
01:30:18,832 --> 01:30:20,542
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

904
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:24,421
A good idea? Take another look.

905
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:29,259
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?

906
01:30:29,509 --> 01:30:31,553
Their condition has been improved?

907
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,431
- Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
- Yes, sir, but...

908
01:30:34,598 --> 01:30:37,267
They feed better
and they are no longer abused.

909
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:39,019
- That's all true.
- Well, then.

910
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:42,522
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

911
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:44,649
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.

912
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:48,695
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

913
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:51,948
...forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.

914
01:30:52,115 --> 01:30:53,867
Perhaps even as
treasonable activity.

915
01:30:54,034 --> 01:30:58,121
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.

916
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,583
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?

917
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:05,337
Must we build them a better bridge
than they could have themselves?

918
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,300
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

919
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:14,179
Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?

920
01:31:14,346 --> 01:31:17,223
Would you have it said that
our chaps can't do a proper job?

921
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:22,395
It's important to show these people
they can't break us in body or in spirit.

922
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:24,898
Take a good look, Clipton.

923
01:31:25,732 --> 01:31:27,817
One day the war will be over.

924
01:31:28,026 --> 01:31:31,404
I hope that the people who use
this bridge in years to come...

925
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:34,741
...will remember how it was built,
and who built it.

926
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:40,330
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.

927
01:31:40,497 --> 01:31:42,874
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor...

928
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:45,960
...but you've a lot to learn
about the army.

929
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:11,277
Hold him! Hold him!

930
01:32:11,486 --> 01:32:15,573
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?

931
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:24,332
Good morning.

932
01:32:38,054 --> 01:32:40,432
What on earth
are you people staring at?

933
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:42,726
Get on with your jobs!

934
01:32:43,977 --> 01:32:45,812
Now get him with your boot!

935
01:32:58,408 --> 01:32:59,951
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.

936
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:03,997
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?

937
01:33:04,164 --> 01:33:06,875
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

938
01:33:07,709 --> 01:33:10,545
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.

939
01:33:10,712 --> 01:33:12,088
Sit down.

940
01:33:12,839 --> 01:33:17,135
I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.

941
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:20,054
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:23,475
Chapman here wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts about him.

943
01:33:23,725 --> 01:33:27,520
I think he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

944
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:28,938
As I've told you before...

945
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:33,485
...in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.

946
01:33:33,735 --> 01:33:36,112
He's the best swimmer
in the school, sir.

947
01:33:36,362 --> 01:33:40,658
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.

948
01:33:44,162 --> 01:33:46,080
All right, at ease.

949
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:54,506
These gentlemen are thinking of
taking you for a hike into the jungle.

950
01:33:54,756 --> 01:33:56,090
Yes, sir.

951
01:33:56,758 --> 01:33:59,010
You were an accountant in Montreal?

952
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,429
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.

953
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,807
That is, I didn't have my charter.

954
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:05,433
Exactly what did you do?

955
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:09,646
Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures...

956
01:34:09,896 --> 01:34:12,398
...which people had checked
before me...

957
01:34:12,565 --> 01:34:16,027
...and then other people checked them
after I had checked them.

958
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:19,531
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a frightful bore.

959
01:34:19,697 --> 01:34:21,366
How did you happen
to wind up here?

960
01:34:21,533 --> 01:34:24,077
In '39 I came over to London
to enlist.

961
01:34:24,244 --> 01:34:26,788
About two years later
I volunteered for this work.

962
01:34:26,955 --> 01:34:30,667
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir. See, the regular army...

963
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,544
Go ahead, you can be frank.

964
01:34:32,961 --> 01:34:38,049
Well, the regular army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.

965
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:40,510
They don't expect you to think.

966
01:34:42,804 --> 01:34:44,472
Think about this.

967
01:34:44,764 --> 01:34:47,725
Are you quite sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?

968
01:34:48,184 --> 01:34:49,477
I know how to use it, sir.

969
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:53,731
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?

970
01:34:53,982 --> 01:34:56,359
Could you kill without hesitation?

971
01:34:57,443 --> 01:35:02,532
That's a question I've often asked
myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.

972
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:04,701
And what was the answer?

973
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:07,203
I don't honestly know, sir.

974
01:35:07,954 --> 01:35:10,540
I've tried to imagine myself...

975
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:16,379
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

976
01:35:17,088 --> 01:35:19,048
It's an old army problem.

977
01:35:19,674 --> 01:35:22,844
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.

978
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:26,890
Am I to go with the team, sir?

979
01:35:28,391 --> 01:35:29,684
We'll let you know.

980
01:35:37,317 --> 01:35:38,484
You see what I mean.

981
01:35:38,693 --> 01:35:40,612
Well, at least he was honest.

982
01:35:40,862 --> 01:35:45,366
None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

983
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:47,160
What's your opinion, Shears?

984
01:35:48,494 --> 01:35:50,079
Well, sir, he's Canadian.

985
01:35:50,288 --> 01:35:54,500
And that's in keeping with the
international composition of this outfit.

986
01:35:54,834 --> 01:35:57,170
If he wants to go,
he can even take my place.

987
01:35:58,004 --> 01:36:01,507
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

988
01:36:02,175 --> 01:36:05,261
I had a report from air reconnaissance
on that village.

989
01:36:05,428 --> 01:36:08,431
There's sufficient clearing
to make your jump at last light.

990
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:11,893
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

991
01:36:12,101 --> 01:36:14,812
Blast. This is awkward.

992
01:36:15,063 --> 01:36:17,273
Silly, it never occurred to me.

993
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:18,900
Well, maybe...

994
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:22,070
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.

995
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,197
I'll pop over
and check right away.

996
01:36:24,447 --> 01:36:27,533
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.

997
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:32,121
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

998
01:36:32,372 --> 01:36:33,748
Yes, sir.

999
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,668
You don't realize what a plum
you are for us.

1000
01:36:36,918 --> 01:36:40,421
Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.

1001
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:44,801
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

1002
01:36:47,595 --> 01:36:52,100
By the way, here's something
that'll interest you. The new L pill.

1003
01:36:53,142 --> 01:36:56,688
- I pill?
- I for lethal. Instantaneous, painless.

1004
01:36:56,896 --> 01:37:00,233
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.

1005
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:02,986
You're telling me
not to be taken alive.

1006
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:05,071
I wouldn't recommend it.

1007
01:37:05,571 --> 01:37:09,742
If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.

1008
01:37:09,993 --> 01:37:12,328
The objective comes first
in our work.

1009
01:37:12,996 --> 01:37:15,373
You want my honest evaluation
of this team?

1010
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:17,667
I didn't want to speak out
in front of them.

1011
01:37:17,834 --> 01:37:19,627
I understand, go ahead.

1012
01:37:21,087 --> 01:37:24,340
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

1013
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,343
Joyce is... He'll be okay.

1014
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:30,263
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh, why not?

1015
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:32,223
Cambridge don and all of that.

1016
01:37:32,432 --> 01:37:36,019
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers...

1017
01:37:36,269 --> 01:37:38,604
He's not without experience,
you know.

1018
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,443
When we lost Singapore, he stayed
behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

1019
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:46,404
And many other installations
before the Japs caught him.

1020
01:37:46,612 --> 01:37:47,613
- Caught him?
- Yes.

1021
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:50,700
- Fascinating story. He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.

1022
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:55,496
In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worthwhile.

1023
01:37:55,663 --> 01:37:57,373
- No?
- If you make one jump...

1024
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,792
...you've only got 50 percent
chance of injury.

1025
01:37:59,959 --> 01:38:03,546
Two jumps, 80 percent. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.

1026
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:07,717
The consensus is, the most sensible
thing for Major Shears to do...

1027
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:10,928
...is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

1028
01:38:11,179 --> 01:38:13,222
With or without parachute?

1029
01:38:18,311 --> 01:38:20,521
Oh, very good!

1030
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:25,735
With or without!

1031
01:39:22,917 --> 01:39:23,960
He's in the trees!

1032
01:40:02,957 --> 01:40:05,626
Yai says we can't reach
the Kwai by the route you took.

1033
01:40:05,835 --> 01:40:07,879
There are too many
Japanese patrols.

1034
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:10,256
We'll swing north
through heavy jungle.

1035
01:40:10,423 --> 01:40:12,633
- Who's gonna lead the way?
- Yai himself.

1036
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,344
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.

1037
01:40:15,595 --> 01:40:18,347
Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.

1038
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:21,058
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.

1039
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:35,656
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night in the village.

1040
01:40:35,907 --> 01:40:37,950
There's an enemy post
three miles away...

1041
01:40:38,117 --> 01:40:40,161
...so we'll have to sleep
in the jungle.

1042
01:40:40,328 --> 01:40:45,041
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.

1043
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:46,918
Is there something wrong?

1044
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:52,798
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language. I don't.

1045
01:40:53,049 --> 01:40:57,053
He's gonna lead you back to the river
by a route I never took.

1046
01:40:57,303 --> 01:41:00,932
Will someone tell me why
I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1047
01:41:01,182 --> 01:41:05,478
I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?

1048
01:41:06,062 --> 01:41:07,813
Tell that to Chapman.

1049
01:41:08,064 --> 01:41:09,649
Let's get cracking.

1050
01:44:13,582 --> 01:44:15,251
You're lovely.

1051
01:44:17,795 --> 01:44:19,046
Lovely.

1052
01:44:19,296 --> 01:44:21,507
Be happy in your work.

1053
01:44:21,799 --> 01:44:23,008
Yes, sir.

1054
01:44:50,369 --> 01:44:51,745
Leeches.

1055
01:44:52,329 --> 01:44:53,831
Leeches.

1056
01:45:09,138 --> 01:45:13,225
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.

1057
01:45:13,392 --> 01:45:16,020
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

1058
01:45:16,187 --> 01:45:18,689
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1059
01:45:18,939 --> 01:45:22,443
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.

1060
01:45:22,651 --> 01:45:24,195
What's wrong with that thing?

1061
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:28,032
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

1062
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:29,533
I'll tell you what's wrong.

1063
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:33,662
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.

1064
01:45:33,829 --> 01:45:35,581
You might as well dump it!

1065
01:45:40,628 --> 01:45:42,838
<i>This is Radio Tokyo signing off.</i>

1066
01:45:43,088 --> 01:45:47,593
<i>This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy...</i>

1067
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:50,346
<i>...and never volunteer for anything.</i>

1068
01:46:03,526 --> 01:46:05,611
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

1069
01:46:05,778 --> 01:46:08,113
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it.

1070
01:46:08,322 --> 01:46:12,159
Yes, sir. "One, original
bridge works reported abandoned.

1071
01:46:12,368 --> 01:46:14,995
New construction downstream
from first site.

1072
01:46:15,246 --> 01:46:19,333
Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train...

1073
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:22,503
...Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.l.P.

1074
01:46:22,753 --> 01:46:25,381
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.

1075
01:46:25,631 --> 01:46:28,759
Three, synchronize demolition
with passage this train.

1076
01:46:28,926 --> 01:46:32,137
Four, good hunting. Have fun."
That's all, sir.

1077
01:46:32,388 --> 01:46:34,098
A train and a bridge!

1078
01:46:34,265 --> 01:46:36,684
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?

1079
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:39,436
Yai says we're two to three days'
march from the Kwai.

1080
01:46:39,645 --> 01:46:43,649
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.

1081
01:46:43,899 --> 01:46:45,818
It's worth it for the train.

1082
01:46:46,068 --> 01:46:49,363
Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.

1083
01:46:49,572 --> 01:46:51,574
Jolly good fun. Jolly, jolly good.

1084
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,161
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

1085
01:46:56,412 --> 01:46:59,164
Well, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

1086
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:04,044
Heave!

1087
01:47:04,211 --> 01:47:07,923
Heave! Heave!

1088
01:47:24,315 --> 01:47:26,817
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

1089
01:47:28,527 --> 01:47:31,196
Well, we'll complete this later.

1090
01:47:32,072 --> 01:47:35,576
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

1091
01:47:36,577 --> 01:47:40,706
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.

1092
01:47:40,873 --> 01:47:42,499
We just haven't the manpower.

1093
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:46,003
I've asked the officers to lend a hand,
but even that won't do it.

1094
01:47:46,211 --> 01:47:47,838
The officers are going to work?

1095
01:47:48,088 --> 01:47:51,842
I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.

1096
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:53,844
Why not ask Saito
for some of his men?

1097
01:47:54,011 --> 01:47:57,181
This is our show. We must
make the most of our resources.

1098
01:47:57,348 --> 01:48:00,225
That's what I came to talk
to you about. The sick list.

1099
01:48:00,476 --> 01:48:04,188
There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

1100
01:48:04,355 --> 01:48:06,815
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you...

1101
01:48:06,982 --> 01:48:09,234
...but there are always
a few malingerers.

1102
01:48:09,443 --> 01:48:11,862
Be honest. Keep an open mind
is all I ask.

1103
01:48:12,112 --> 01:48:13,947
Come along, let's see.

1104
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:17,284
Don't move, don't move.

1105
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,748
What's the matter with Haskins?

1106
01:48:22,915 --> 01:48:26,627
He's got amoebic dysentery and
blackwater fever. Temperature of 104.

1107
01:48:26,794 --> 01:48:28,337
Right. I see.

1108
01:48:31,423 --> 01:48:32,633
And this man?

1109
01:48:32,883 --> 01:48:36,845
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save
the leg if I do more cutting tonight.

1110
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:39,056
Really want to send him
out to work, sir'?

1111
01:48:39,264 --> 01:48:41,058
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1112
01:48:45,437 --> 01:48:48,065
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.

1113
01:48:48,273 --> 01:48:50,567
Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.

1114
01:48:50,776 --> 01:48:53,487
I wonder, in his case,
if fresh air and light duties...

1115
01:48:53,654 --> 01:48:55,781
...might do more good
than being cooped up.

1116
01:48:55,948 --> 01:48:58,951
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...

1117
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:01,745
- ...just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?

1118
01:49:01,912 --> 01:49:03,163
Well, is it?

1119
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:07,376
A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still make himself useful.

1120
01:49:07,543 --> 01:49:11,213
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.

1121
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:15,050
Tell me, you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

1122
01:49:16,677 --> 01:49:19,221
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

1123
01:49:20,305 --> 01:49:22,015
What about you? Nothing difficult.

1124
01:49:22,182 --> 01:49:24,643
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

1125
01:49:26,395 --> 01:49:31,191
Now, look here, men. It goes
without saying I'm proud of all of you.

1126
01:49:31,358 --> 01:49:35,946
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it...

1127
01:49:36,196 --> 01:49:40,325
...how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1128
01:49:40,534 --> 01:49:41,952
What do you say?

1129
01:49:42,161 --> 01:49:45,831
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Come on, follow me.

1130
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,434
Ten minutes.

1131
01:53:27,427 --> 01:53:29,304
Make sure they're all dead.

1132
01:53:32,766 --> 01:53:34,142
Come on, Joyce.

1133
01:53:36,353 --> 01:53:38,981
Use your knife, man,
or we'll be shooting each other.

1134
01:53:51,284 --> 01:53:52,953
Go that way, Joyce.

1135
01:56:01,373 --> 01:56:04,209
I could have done it. I was ready.

1136
01:56:08,713 --> 01:56:10,090
Are you hit, sir?

1137
01:56:10,465 --> 01:56:11,758
Let's go.

1138
01:56:33,113 --> 01:56:36,867
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone,
but there's nothing broken.

1139
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:39,202
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up, Joyce.

1140
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:41,788
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.

1141
01:56:41,955 --> 01:56:43,915
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1142
01:56:44,124 --> 01:56:46,793
We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?

1143
01:59:59,277 --> 02:00:00,945
What are you doing?

1144
02:00:01,446 --> 02:00:03,490
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1145
02:00:03,698 --> 02:00:05,158
We all need it.

1146
02:00:09,245 --> 02:00:12,791
We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.

1147
02:00:12,999 --> 02:00:14,334
Maybe six.

1148
02:00:15,377 --> 02:00:16,544
Come on.

1149
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:19,297
You keep walking on that foot,
you'll bleed to death.

1150
02:00:20,673 --> 02:00:22,217
Yeah.

1151
02:00:26,888 --> 02:00:29,974
- You're gonna leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.

1152
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:33,478
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

1153
02:00:33,686 --> 02:00:35,814
You've got to get there
before sundown.

1154
02:00:36,022 --> 02:00:40,693
But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route...

1155
02:00:40,985 --> 02:00:43,071
...or whether we could find you
if we did?

1156
02:00:43,321 --> 02:00:46,866
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.

1157
02:00:47,117 --> 02:00:48,618
He doesn't know it, but I do.

1158
02:00:48,785 --> 02:00:52,247
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

1159
02:00:52,997 --> 02:00:56,418
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

1160
02:00:56,626 --> 02:00:58,920
You're in command now, Shears.

1161
02:01:01,673 --> 02:01:03,508
I won't obey that order.

1162
02:01:03,883 --> 02:01:05,635
You make me sick with your heroics.

1163
02:01:05,844 --> 02:01:08,638
You carry the stench of death
like the plague.

1164
02:01:08,888 --> 02:01:11,099
Explosives and L pills
go well together.

1165
02:01:11,349 --> 02:01:15,019
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1166
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:17,021
This is just a game, this war.

1167
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:21,151
You and that Colonel Nicholson,
you're crazy with courage. For what?

1168
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:24,362
How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules...

1169
02:01:24,571 --> 02:01:28,324
...when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

1170
02:01:32,328 --> 02:01:35,206
I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden...

1171
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:40,420
...because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.

1172
02:01:40,879 --> 02:01:43,548
If we go on, we go on together.

1173
02:01:46,468 --> 02:01:48,136
Good old Yai.

1174
02:02:00,106 --> 02:02:01,274
I'm all right.

1175
02:02:11,951 --> 02:02:13,244
Come on.

1176
02:03:02,752 --> 02:03:04,212
Let's get closer.

1177
02:03:23,731 --> 02:03:25,942
Still sorry we brought you along?

1178
02:03:27,652 --> 02:03:29,529
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1179
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:31,990
You're in command again now,
you know.

1180
02:03:32,198 --> 02:03:33,866
Thank you, major.

1181
02:03:34,742 --> 02:03:39,747
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

1182
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:45,336
Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

1183
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:46,921
Look.

1184
02:03:48,756 --> 02:03:50,800
Those poor devils down there.

1185
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:54,887
Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.

1186
02:03:56,014 --> 02:03:59,017
They've got a British officer
working on his knees.

1187
02:03:59,267 --> 02:04:01,352
The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.

1188
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:05,690
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale a little.

1189
02:04:24,834 --> 02:04:28,212
If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.

1190
02:04:28,421 --> 02:04:31,257
Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1191
02:04:31,507 --> 02:04:33,760
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1192
02:04:34,385 --> 02:04:37,138
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

1193
02:04:37,388 --> 02:04:40,892
...about three feet under the water,
I should think...

1194
02:04:41,142 --> 02:04:44,479
...and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.

1195
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:48,566
The problem is where to hide it.

1196
02:04:53,655 --> 02:04:56,783
Our side of the river is quite
obviously used by the Japanese.

1197
02:04:57,116 --> 02:04:58,993
They'd spot it at once.

1198
02:05:02,830 --> 02:05:06,000
Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?

1199
02:05:06,167 --> 02:05:09,545
And the gray rock just below them
on that little beach?

1200
02:05:10,129 --> 02:05:13,633
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.

1201
02:05:14,467 --> 02:05:16,344
It's on the wrong side of the river...

1202
02:05:16,511 --> 02:05:20,098
...but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

1203
02:05:21,557 --> 02:05:23,643
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1204
02:05:24,102 --> 02:05:26,979
...whoever's there
will have to swim back.

1205
02:05:27,188 --> 02:05:29,232
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.

1206
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:31,984
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

1207
02:05:32,151 --> 02:05:33,695
Yeah.

1208
02:05:34,862 --> 02:05:37,115
It looks like
your line of country, then.

1209
02:05:37,281 --> 02:05:38,324
Thank you, sir.

1210
02:05:38,491 --> 02:05:42,328
Shears, pick a spot on our side of
the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1211
02:05:42,578 --> 02:05:45,498
Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...

1212
02:05:45,707 --> 02:05:47,959
- ...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
- Right.

1213
02:05:48,126 --> 02:05:50,670
On the theory that
there's always one more thing...

1214
02:05:50,837 --> 02:05:55,299
...I'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversion.

1215
02:05:55,508 --> 02:05:58,886
Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.

1216
02:05:59,137 --> 02:06:00,388
All clear?

1217
02:06:00,638 --> 02:06:03,933
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.

1218
02:06:04,142 --> 02:06:06,978
They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge...

1219
02:06:07,186 --> 02:06:11,023
...so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver...

1220
02:06:11,315 --> 02:06:13,025
...which means building a raft.

1221
02:06:13,192 --> 02:06:14,360
Yai.

1222
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:21,743
Yai will take three women
to help you build the raft.

1223
02:06:21,909 --> 02:06:25,163
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.

1224
02:06:27,915 --> 02:06:29,500
Shears.

1225
02:06:30,209 --> 02:06:33,671
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1226
02:06:33,838 --> 02:06:35,173
I know.

1227
02:06:35,339 --> 02:06:37,258
You think he'll be all right?

1228
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:39,969
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1229
02:06:40,553 --> 02:06:43,514
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

1230
02:06:43,931 --> 02:06:45,391
I'm sorry.

1231
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:48,770
When it's over, I hope you get
that medical discharge...

1232
02:06:48,936 --> 02:06:50,730
...and not the hard way.

1233
02:06:50,897 --> 02:06:52,273
Thanks.

1234
02:07:30,269 --> 02:07:31,479
Load.

1235
02:08:37,295 --> 02:08:38,588
Beautiful.

1236
02:08:39,338 --> 02:08:41,007
Yes, beautiful.

1237
02:08:41,299 --> 02:08:43,092
A first-rate job.

1238
02:08:43,551 --> 02:08:46,012
I had no idea it would
turn out so well.

1239
02:08:49,473 --> 02:08:51,142
Yes.

1240
02:08:51,392 --> 02:08:53,728
A beautiful creation.

1241
02:08:54,979 --> 02:08:56,480
I've been thinking.

1242
02:08:57,481 --> 02:09:02,069
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.

1243
02:09:02,361 --> 02:09:04,989
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1244
02:09:06,282 --> 02:09:09,994
I haven't been at home more
than 10 months in all that time.

1245
02:09:10,578 --> 02:09:12,914
Still, it's been a good life.

1246
02:09:14,248 --> 02:09:16,375
I love India.

1247
02:09:18,002 --> 02:09:20,212
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1248
02:09:21,881 --> 02:09:23,591
But there are times...

1249
02:09:25,259 --> 02:09:29,597
...when suddenly you realize you are
nearer the end than the beginning.

1250
02:09:30,598 --> 02:09:32,141
And you wonder...

1251
02:09:33,809 --> 02:09:35,853
You ask yourself...

1252
02:09:37,188 --> 02:09:40,441
...what the sum total
of your life represents...

1253
02:09:41,233 --> 02:09:44,820
...what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

1254
02:09:45,321 --> 02:09:47,949
...or if it made any difference
at all, really.

1255
02:09:49,575 --> 02:09:52,954
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

1256
02:09:53,537 --> 02:09:56,123
I don't know whether that
kind of thinking's healthy...

1257
02:09:56,707 --> 02:10:00,294
...but I must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines...

1258
02:10:00,461 --> 02:10:02,755
...from time to time.

1259
02:10:05,841 --> 02:10:07,551
But tonight...

1260
02:10:09,053 --> 02:10:10,054
Tonight...

1261
02:10:13,808 --> 02:10:15,267
Blast.

1262
02:10:22,191 --> 02:10:23,651
I must be off.

1263
02:10:26,487 --> 02:10:29,865
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

1264
02:11:16,746 --> 02:11:18,039
Lovely.

1265
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:32,055
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1266
02:18:32,264 --> 02:18:35,350
...when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.

1267
02:18:37,102 --> 02:18:39,354
As you know,
most of you move on tomorrow...

1268
02:18:39,563 --> 02:18:42,232
...to a new camp
and new construction.

1269
02:18:42,691 --> 02:18:47,029
It's a pity you won't be here to see
the first practical use of this bridge.

1270
02:18:47,196 --> 02:18:50,032
However, you'll be glad to know
that the completion...

1271
02:18:50,199 --> 02:18:52,409
...of this link in the railway...

1272
02:18:52,618 --> 02:18:55,996
...will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled...

1273
02:18:56,246 --> 02:18:59,333
...to the new camp by train.

1274
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:03,921
Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind...

1275
02:19:04,129 --> 02:19:06,465
...with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

1276
02:19:06,715 --> 02:19:10,219
...and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

1277
02:19:12,262 --> 02:19:15,432
Now that your work here
is finished...

1278
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:19,686
...I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.

1279
02:19:20,479 --> 02:19:22,481
That's quite understandable.

1280
02:19:22,773 --> 02:19:25,400
It's a very natural reaction.

1281
02:19:27,778 --> 02:19:31,031
But one day, in a week,
a month, a year...

1282
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:35,118
...on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

1283
02:19:35,786 --> 02:19:40,999
...you're going to feel very proud
of what you have achieved here...

1284
02:19:41,166 --> 02:19:43,961
...in the face of great adversity.

1285
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:47,297
What you have done should be...

1286
02:19:48,173 --> 02:19:50,008
...and I think will be...

1287
02:19:50,384 --> 02:19:55,013
...an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.

1288
02:19:56,223 --> 02:19:58,767
You have survived with honor.

1289
02:19:59,685 --> 02:20:01,478
That, and more.

1290
02:20:03,146 --> 02:20:05,232
Here in the wilderness...

1291
02:20:05,524 --> 02:20:08,986
...you have turned defeat
into victory.

1292
02:20:11,738 --> 02:20:13,782
I congratulate you.

1293
02:20:14,324 --> 02:20:15,367
Well done.

1294
02:20:20,747 --> 02:20:22,040
To the king.

1295
02:23:04,411 --> 02:23:05,871
And you're in business.

1296
02:23:06,079 --> 02:23:09,916
Now, you got everything? Sten,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1297
02:23:10,083 --> 02:23:11,585
Yes.

1298
02:23:11,877 --> 02:23:14,171
I'll be directly across the river.

1299
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:18,550
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.

1300
02:23:19,259 --> 02:23:21,470
I can't think of what it could be.

1301
02:23:22,888 --> 02:23:25,432
Except to wish you
a long and happy life.

1302
02:23:25,849 --> 02:23:27,392
Thank you.

1303
02:25:42,652 --> 02:25:44,112
What's happened?

1304
02:25:49,284 --> 02:25:51,036
The river's gone down.

1305
02:26:13,266 --> 02:26:15,185
You can see the wire.

1306
02:26:16,019 --> 02:26:17,312
The charges!

1307
02:28:25,648 --> 02:28:28,026
Don't wait for the train.

1308
02:28:28,318 --> 02:28:29,402
Do it now!

1309
02:28:56,971 --> 02:29:00,809
If Saito is correct, the train
should be along in five or 10 minutes.

1310
02:29:01,059 --> 02:29:03,812
If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.

1311
02:29:03,978 --> 02:29:06,147
Why? You'll get a better view
from the bridge.

1312
02:29:06,314 --> 02:29:09,734
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.

1313
02:29:09,984 --> 02:29:14,405
As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

1314
02:29:14,572 --> 02:29:18,910
Well, as you once said, sir,
I've got a lot to learn about the army.

1315
02:29:25,875 --> 02:29:27,252
Good morning.

1316
02:29:27,502 --> 02:29:29,754
River's gone down in the night.

1317
02:31:14,484 --> 02:31:15,652
What's he doing?

1318
02:32:02,448 --> 02:32:05,576
Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.

1319
02:32:05,868 --> 02:32:09,497
I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.

1320
02:33:08,348 --> 02:33:09,766
He's gone mad.

1321
02:33:09,974 --> 02:33:12,060
He's leading him right to it.

1322
02:33:12,310 --> 02:33:13,728
Our own man!

1323
02:33:57,980 --> 02:34:00,858
I was right.
There is something going on.

1324
02:34:56,038 --> 02:34:59,333
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.

1325
02:35:02,170 --> 02:35:06,174
Colonel, have you a knife? I've just
realized the bridge has been mined.

1326
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:07,800
Mined?

1327
02:35:14,682 --> 02:35:15,766
Good boy!

1328
02:35:20,730 --> 02:35:23,649
Officer, sir. British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.

1329
02:35:23,816 --> 02:35:27,862
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1330
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:30,781
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. There's no time!

1331
02:35:30,948 --> 02:35:33,409
No, no! Help!

1332
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:39,957
Help!

1333
02:35:40,666 --> 02:35:42,960
Kill him! Kill him!

1334
02:35:43,336 --> 02:35:45,796
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!

1335
02:35:46,839 --> 02:35:49,717
Kill him! Kill him!

1336
02:35:54,639 --> 02:35:56,390
Help!

1337
02:36:00,019 --> 02:36:02,146
Kill him, Joyce! Kill him!

1338
02:36:55,283 --> 02:36:56,325
You!

1339
02:36:57,326 --> 02:36:58,995
You!

1340
02:37:12,883 --> 02:37:14,677
What have I done?

1341
02:38:23,329 --> 02:38:24,872
Madness.

1342
02:38:37,426 --> 02:38:39,261
I had to do it.

1343
02:38:40,179 --> 02:38:43,432
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.

1344
02:38:43,933 --> 02:38:45,935
It was the only thing to do!

1345
02:39:22,221 --> 02:39:23,681
Madness.

1346
02:39:26,475 --> 02:39:27,685
Madness.
