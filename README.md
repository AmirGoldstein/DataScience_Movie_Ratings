# DataScience_Movie_Ratings

## There are 3 big sources we used in order to scrape the data from the internet.
* IMDB
* Metacritic
* Rotten Tomatoes

## In the project, we separated the data acquisition into notebooks: 
* IMDB_Scraping.ipynb
* Rotten_Scraping.ipynb
* Metacritic_Scraping.ipynb
* After we had a list of movies, we ran a script that downloaded the subtitles one by one:
Subtitle_downloader.ipynb (located in /srt/ folder)

## We will also look for the correlation between the Parental Guidance and the language used in the movies of IMDB group.
* PG_Machine_Learning.ipynb

## Visualizations and Analyze:
